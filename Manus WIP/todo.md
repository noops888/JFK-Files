# JFK Files Processing Plan

## Understanding the Collection
- [x] Analyze the size and scope of the JFK Files collection (65.9 GB, 73,056 files)
- [x] Identify file formats and quality issues (many poor quality files requiring OCR)
- [x] Note distribution across different releases (2017-2025)

## Research Knowledge Base Options
- [x] Research RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) frameworks
- [x] Identify open-source and budget-friendly options
- [x] Evaluate vector database options for storing embeddings
- [x] Compare embedding models for document processing

## Evaluate File Processing Approaches
- [x] Research OCR solutions for poor quality documents
- [x] Identify text extraction libraries for PDF processing
- [x] Evaluate chunking strategies for large document collections
- [ ] Assess computational requirements for processing 65.9 GB of data

## Design Processing Pipeline
- [x] Design a budget-friendly processing pipeline
- [x] Select appropriate tools for each stage (OCR, text extraction, embedding)
- [x] Determine optimal chunking and embedding strategy
- [x] Plan for incremental processing to manage large collection

## Implementation Guide
- [x] Create step-by-step implementation instructions
- [x] Provide code examples for key processing steps
- [x] Include resource requirements and estimated processing times
- [x] Develop troubleshooting guidance for common issues

## Final Recommendations
