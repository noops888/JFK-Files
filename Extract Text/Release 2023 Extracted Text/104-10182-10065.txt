office, Pittsburgh; Major E. J. Zvetina and Mr. F. G. Jaycocks, of the

undersigned's aim was to determine if Subject was knowledgeable regarding
detailed operational intelligence and Soviet Realities, while 00 processed
its normal requirements, including those of TSD, and the Air Force interrogated
Subject along technical lines.
2. Because time was short, it was decided that the undersigned would

eight hours of debriefing opportunity and on this basis recommended that
Subject be brought to Washington, D. C. for detailed debriefing.

made through the Office of Security and Subject stayed at the Marriott Motel,
Key Bridge, during 15-28 July 1962. See Enclosure B for a listing of staff
personnel who participated in the debriefing of Subject; this listing includes
