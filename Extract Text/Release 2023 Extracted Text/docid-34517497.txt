1. Clemard Joseph-Charles was released from prison during the evening of 25 Apr
68 in return for a "ransom" of US $605 thousand.
2. Charlcs has been given until 24 May 60 to produce the US $505 thousand. This
sun must bo in an irrevocable letter of credit on an American bank in favor
of the National Bank of the Republic of Haiti. It has been intimated that
the 24 May 68 deadline can be extended, should Charles be experiencing any
really unusual difficulties in producing the required money.
3. In order to obtain his release from prison, Charles had to sign a memorandum
of understanding that he would produce the US $605 thousand plus some
unidentified real property. These terms were agreed to by both Charles and
his wife prior to the release. At the same time, Charles wrote a personal
letter to President Duvalier asking for release and promising to hand over
the money and property in question.
4. Charles is now under house arrest in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.
5. Charles's immediate resources consist of about US $100 thousand in cash in
two US banks (no additional data available), various homms, businesses
(essential oils, an automobile dealership and others (no additional data avail-
able)), buildings, land and about US $400 thousand worth of Haition covernment
bonda. He did have another US $300 thousand in personal funds in Haiti. He
can no longer count on this money to help raise the US $505 thousand, however,
because prior to his relcase from prison the Haition authoritics (no addi-
tional data available) confiscated it.
6. Charles has agreed to raise the US $605 thousand on condition that it be used
to pay off legitimate claims of depositors in his Banque Commerciale d'Haiti.
He has stated that he will permit the money to be paid out only to those
depositors who are able to produce documentary proof that they had deposited
funds in his bank.

7. Charles and coveral associates now propose to reorganize the Eanque Comerciale
Q'Haiti, formerly his privato preserve, into a corporate entity and to incor-
parate it in the US. The associates plan to raise U3 $500 thousand for this
now corporatica. This cua vill be coparate from the US $505 thousand and will
serve to put the now tanking corporation into tasiness. Eccretarial help and
at icast cm of the aiz directors of the corporation vill to us citizens.
The of the directors will be Charles himself and Louis Lovequs.
8. President Duvalior is reportedly most interested in the ceu venture ca is
anxious to cco it succeed. He has finally realized that the economic cituation
in Haiti has deterioratei co badly during the past 10 months that bo mast do
something before total bankruptcy occurs. Accordingly, President Duvalier wants
to improve his "image" in the cyes of the cutside world, particularly in the US,
and by doing co hopes to attract Investments and business activitica from cut-
oida Haiti. Es apparently hopes that the new, incorporated, Eanque Commerciale
d'Haiti, will help attract such activity to Haiti and is therefore permitting
Charles to proceed.
9. Collector's Note: 00-B-321/12106-68 described a possible reorganization in
the Eaitian Government. This reorganization, sponsored by Duvalier, vould
place Duvalier on the elevated plans of spiritual elviser and father of the
people and vould, on the curcico, at least, turn over to a president the day-
to-day management of Haitian government affairs. Various nomes have been
mentioned for the position of president under the possible new system. 7 The
name of Luc-Albert Foucard has recently been mentioned frequently in Haiti as
the possible new president under the rumored reorganization of the goverment.
Foucard is a son-in-law of Duvalier and lives in Haiti. He is in charge of
tourism. Some say that Duvalier listens to Foucard and is, to a degree,
influenced by him. I doubt this very strongly.
