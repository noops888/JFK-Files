MEMORANDUM
SUBJECT
: Garrison Investigation of
Kennedy Assassination:
Donald P. (or T.) NORTON
1. On 6 August 1967 we were informed that the Vancouver
(Canada) Sun was running or soon would run an interview with one
Donald P. (or T.) NORTON, 35 years old, who had made the
following claims.
a. That he was a CIA man and that in 1958 he
delivered $150,000 to David FERRIE for transfer
to Cuba. (Comment: David W. FERRIE, now dead,
was a pilot living in New Orleans. District Attorney
James C. Garrison has claimed that FERRIE was
one of a small group of conspirators who master-
minded the assassination of President Kennedy.
Allegations that CIA employed FERRIE have appeared
in print. Thorough checks have shown that there
was no association between FERRIE and this Agency.)
b. That in 1962 Clay SHAW gave NORTON an
attache case containing $50,000 which NORTON de-
livered to one Harvey Lee in Monterrey, Mexico.
(Comment: There is no evidence that Lee Harvey
Oswald was in Mexico in 1962. There is no evidence,
except the unsupported word of a criminal and drug
addict, that Clay SHAW knew Oswald. SHAW is the
only person indicted by Garrison to date on the charge
of conspiring to kill President Kennedy.)

c. That NORTON received $500 a month pay
from CIA and that he also received bonuses of $5,000
for the action described in sub-paragraph a, above, and
$2,500 for that described in sub-paragraph b.
d. That NORTON reported to an unidentified oil
company official in Calgary, Alberta, Canada,
e.
That NORTON lost his CIA job in November
1966 and was advised to settle down in Calgary.
2. Efforts are under way to obtain a copy of the edition of the
Vancouver Sun containing the article herein described. However,
C/E/BC/C is also requested to ask the Ottawa Station to try to get a
copy for us, either independently or through liaison. 16-16
3. All pertinent Agency records have been checked. There is
no record of a Donald P. NORTON or Donald T. NORTON. There is
also no record of a Donald NORTON who matches any of the foregoing
information.
4. The C/E/BC/C is also requested to obtain available informa-
tion from liaison regarding NORTON's general character and reputation
for veracity. Because District Attorney Garrison has made unfounded
charges that CIA and the FBI are interfering in his investigation in New
Orleans, inquiries to liaison should be low-key. It is requested that no
reference be made to Garrison or his investigation. It is suggested that
the only reason given for our interest be that NORTON has made false
allegations that CIA employed him.
5. It is requested that a check be run in the files of WH/COG to
see whether Subject appears therein,
