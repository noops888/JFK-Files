In mid-Degenber., VAINGLORY/12 told (VARIATIC / the following which (7/1
passed to station. GOLUB had recently complained to Johannes VIROLAINEN
that the Finn security police were not paying any attn to cases of British
& American espionage in Finl, adding that the Soviets had info regarding
Western espionage in Finl and would be glad to furnish it to the security
police. GOLUB said some of the western cases were old & some new. Did not
elaborate. Source did not say what VIROLAINEN's reply was to GOLUB.
then said it would behoove AIS officers in Hels to be as careful as
possible cause it quite possible security police would receive orders to keep
their eyes sharply peeled for oper involving Finnish citizens. Pendleton
briefed all senior ODEARL people. COUNIT man said he had reed a warning
few days earlier from a friendly Finnish officer that another ODUNIT officer
had been seen too frequently dirift driving a Volkswagen w/dipl plates around
freight yards of Hel. (This was DIUNIT's energetic factory & freight car
marking program.) The ODOATH man said his family had noticed Finnish policeman
on the beat outside his house had recently begun to go to phone booth & make
a call every time the senior CDOATH man left his house and drove towards town.
Everyone took warning seriously. 7/1 to tell us any further developments.

He knows that Oskari VAINONEN and Antti MAKARA are in Haaparanta. He has photos of MEKARA'
documents & knows that an American interrogates these men in Haaparanta.

Col. Bjork, the Amer Mil Att, is the man who calls the shots for Amer espionage in Finland.

AUB into the Corps.

table for coffee and cognar. Subf was extremely friendly and prosented to ask
the usual. RQ-1 type questions, such as Costille's home in States, how long he'd
bean in Finl, did he have a dipl title, etc. Subj mentioned that his wife was
in the Sov Union and that he was living alone in his apt. Subj speaks no English,
so Finnish was used,

C. about his home and family in the States and his vacation plans. Sabj mentione
that he was not going to be able to take a vacation this sumer as he had hoped.
When C. asked him why, he gave the reason that the And, whom Subj dexcribed as
still being new and not quite sure of himself yet, had told him he wanted hin
to remain in Hels as he was the only person of officer rank in the Consular
Section. (Comments Maybe it's cause KHRUSHCHEV is coming to Hels this summer.)
Not once during the lunch did the subject mentioned in refs (C's trip to USSA
and treatment accorded him) come up. (For any further comments see Finl chronos)
Recently Subj has been making efforts to invite younger members of the
Western embassies to lunch or to view Soviet movies playing at local movie
houses. Subj invited Howard B. Singleton (Canadian), Aydin Yegen (Turk)

COLES also stated that IPIDIS

The reason for this doubtfulness is that when the siapping incident occurred
VAPI had been speaking English to Torreyson. OLUB thought it strange
that EPID, who speaks Finnishwell, shoudl not use that language

and was being held by the Soviets. GCLUB did not reveal the name of the agent,
but said that he had been trained in Austria. To the station's knowledge,
there have been no DSOX missions run via Finland by KUBARK since 1953. Does

GCLUB had reported to VALK at a western agent had been arrested in the
Sov Union near Imatra, but on the Sov side of the border. G. had said that
the avent had been recurited in Switzerland and dispatched across the border
on 19 Nay of 1959. The avent had come to Hels on 17 May and had been met by a
zan described as between 35 and 33 yrs old, about 120 cm. tali; the man smoked a
pipe, spoke good English and passable Finnish. This man had driven the agent to
the firnish border in a Lodge auto, hearing license plate 37-153. WALK/80

car for any such trips or was somehow Involved indirectly. Negative answer.
codine thinks the whoe story is provocation, concocted by the Soviets and
set afoot thru GOLUB to serve as a counter-balance to recent revelations of
Sov espionage in Finl. (See Fab Joint decks for il Dec 59)(sic). Roodein goes

HVD). While there, GOLUB had been instructed to determine what security precaution
the Police of Sweden, Norway and Denmark plan to take to insure the safety of
KHRUSHCHEV during his August visit to the Scan countries. During the conversation,
G. was very critical of his Soviet colleagues in Stoc, Oslo and Cope, for their
failure to develop close relations w/repns of the Security Police of those
countries... G. was vorried not only about his own inability to develop the info
requested, but also for the safety of K. during this trip. G. did not know
for sure whther K. would visit Finland on this trip, but believed that if he did,
it would occur after the visit to the other 3 countries, and that any visit to
Finl would be purely unofficial.
