2. This information results from JAGUAR's continued
mail coverage on the B.R.P.F. offices. We do not know how
such a coverage operates or whether as soome to bo the case
it extends only this category of foreign mail. We will, of
course, continue to probe for more information in the hope of
getting an insight into the Foundation's more operational cor-
respondence, but are not optimistic about succeeding.
