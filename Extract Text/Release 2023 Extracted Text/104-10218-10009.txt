Amico Chy Station officers and carly enthusiasm on the part of
TICTHBORN'S PRI contacts, those contacts became reluctant to delve
iMo Setitive PRI areas or to introduce TICHBORN to other contacts
with inside access. In May Headquarters, the Station, and TICHZORN
all agreed, that the effort should be dropped.
0 Cover and Security..
a. Cover. TICHSORN has done an excellent job of building
Lis cover wirA WUGALINE, iiis area knowledge and language
aidly have proven of real help to the cover company, and ice
h.s shown himself unusually well suited to the needs of inat
company. The cover company demands on his time, both on-the-
job and for foreign and domestic travel, have not interiored with
his operational uulization.

b. Security. While in Mexico, TICHEORN acted as an
unofficial legal závisor for the Center of Studies and Documnemation
which was momioned in the MFDOWEL fiap as being funded by a
CIA condit. however, there was no publicity in Mexico wrien
Lnked on win the Comer. Similarly there was apparently no
public exposure of the funding of the intellectual magazine with
which is was connected, "Dialogos", by other CIA conduits. There.
is no available cridence that his security has been compromised
by the MilDOWEL Rap.
7. Termination and Extension.
Ai
a. While TICHBORN has been available for assignments calling
for his airlities as a political action advisor, the Division has not
had the requirements for such activities wiich were anticipated.
The cominuing use of TICHBORN for CIA tasks of lesser priority,
together with the time and travel demands of his new cover business,
Lave kept hira weil occupied during the period. However, in view
of the icure anticipated lack of demand for TICHEORN's services
on a frequent basis, and the comparatively high cost in administra-
tive, financial, and WH case officer time required, it is felt that
the project should be terminated, effective 30 September 1967.
b. As indicated in the section above on "Cover and Security'
TICHEORN has proven himse to be of real value to his cover
company WUSALINE and to DO. Because of their interest in using
14-00000
ning as a full-time asset, DO has agreed to assume full administrative
and operational responsibility for TICHBORN, effective 1 July
1967. Responsibility for the fulfillment of TICHBORN's contract
(effective through 30 September 1967) will be transferred to DO,
effective 1 July 1967. Full financial responsibility for TICHBORN'S
salary and expenses will be transferred to DO on 1 October 1967.
WILD and DC have agreed that because of TICHBORN's area wied
and exper.cnce, WHD would enjoy a primacy of interest in his possible
future operational use. WIRD agreed to reimburse DO for me costs of
salary and expenses for any sucin future use of TICHLORN.
4. In crder to cover costs of salary and expense of TICHSORN
untul DO assumes financial responsibility on i October 1007, a FY
1008 extension of three momhs (from 1 Jaly 30 September 1967) is
