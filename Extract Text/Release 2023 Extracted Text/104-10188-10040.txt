MICROFIL
1. Since the LIFEAT Project Renewal Request forwarded by refercice (a)
contained a thorough review of the LIFEAT project for the entire project year
through May 1963, most of the items of interest to the project were included in
the review through that date. The following report contains those items not
fully reported or not inaluded in that review plus items of interest occuring
during June 1963. Except for the above noted period, LIFEAT progress reports
generally will be forwarded on a monthly rather than a quarterly basis.
2. The following report is submitted in accordance with CSFIB-F 52-6-1,
section V, paragraph 2 (d) (1).
A. EXPLOITATION OF LEADS
-
(1) LIFEAT/Soviet
During the reporting period LIFEAT has
continued its daily coverage of the home phones of two known
Soviet intelligence officers. Information and leads from this
coverage provide the interested Station Officer with a valuable
check on the Soviet contacts of several KUBARK controlled
double agents. There is also provided the type of information
on daily activities of Soviet personnel without which the plan-
ning for and successful completion of the technical surveillance
operation against one of these Soviets would have been impossible
Station believes that LIFEAT contribution to the success of this
operation deserves particular mention.

(2) LIFEAT/Polish - LIFEAT support to the BEKNAVE/BECHICK operation
in recent months has been particularly noteworthy in providing
travel pians of BEKNAVE. During the intensified efforts against
HEKNAVE in the coming month plans for periodic live-monitoring
by LIFEAT have been completed and should provide a valuable support
to this operation.
(3) LIFEAT/Yugoslav of continued interest to the Station has been
the information concerning the locations being considered by the
Yugoslav mission for a new embassy. Station planning for a technical
operation in this area has depended heavily on LIFEAT leads.
(4) LIFFAT/Cuban - LIFEAT coverage in the AMSTRUT case provides a
window to the operation which is of interest to WAVE and Headquarters.
(Transcripts from these two lines are forwarded semi-weekly to the in-
terested Headquarters component and WAVE.) LIFEAT coverage of the
home of a Cuban Commercial Attache provides information of interest.
concerning Cuban commercial contacts and purchases.
-
(5) LIFEAT/Exile LIFEAT coverage of ESLARD-1 has been most rewarding in
terms of his contacts, travel, and future plans. This information
has been of interest to Headquarters, LIFEAT has exerted every effort
to provide continuing coverage of this target even when ESLARD-1
resided in a hotel under an alias and following his move to new
quarters. Coverage by LIFEAT was especially difficult during E-l'e
stay at the hotel since the technical problems were considerable and
the processing of all calls to and from the hotel in order to extract
E-l's calls was a heavy burden on the LIFEAT processor/translator
staff. It is noted that in Station's opinion the LIFEAT complex
showed up particularly well in this assignment.
LIFEAT coverage of Judith FERRETO Segura has been especially
fruitful concerning the travel and contacts of Costa Rican Communists,
including their travel to Cuba. It has also provided some leads
concerning ZRKNICK operation.
i
(6) LIFEAT/American Communist Group in Mexico (ACGM) During the reporting
period local ODENVY requested that LIFEAT coverage be initiated on
David DRUCKER, prominent member of the ACCM. Product from this
coverage, in conjunction with that coverage already being provided
on Charles SMALL (aka SMOLIKOFF), is valuable to ODENVY in providing
data on U.S. Communists who travel to Mexico and contact the members
of the ACCM. Information is also provided on the daily activities
and contacts of members of the ACCM.
(7) LIFEAT/Miscellaneous Coverage of a former SMOTH agent at the
request of Headquarters resulted in the knowledge that this former
agent was in contact with a number of Soviet Satellite personalities
and was exerting a strong influence on a friend of his, a PAPRIME
citizen employed as the local representative of a well known PBPRIME
news media. It became apparent that the PRPRIME citizen, through
his connection with the news media, was being encouraged by the former
SMOTH agent in an attempt to "destroy" the senior ODACID official
in Mexico. Early warning to this official resulted in action which
greatly diminished the effect of this effort. Coverage of both the
former SMOTH agent and the PBPRIME citizen is being continued.

LIFEAT coverage was also placed on the private office of a
Mexican army General based on a lead that he was the contact of
former Mexican President Lazaro CARDENAS del Rio who was guiding
a number of Mexican army officers of troop command rank who would sup-
port CARDENAS in any show of force. LIFEAT coverage, however, pro-
vided no information of value and was discontinued,

B. PROCESSING OF TAKE
:
Due to the heavy workload shared by the present LIFEAT processor/
transiater staff. it was decided that an additional agent was needed
for these duties. Station review of a numcer of agent candidates to
fill this position was undertaken and one individual was selected.
See paragraph 2 C below.
C. PERSONNE
Provisional operational approval was requested on LIFEUD-28 on 29 May
1963 to fill the need noted in paragraph 2 B above. Recruitment will
be undertaken when such approval is received.
At the end of May 1963, LIFEUD-1 was called into the offices of
the President of the telephone company and told that since he has
passed the retirement age (LIFEUD-1 is 63 years old) "room must be
made for younger men". A retirement payment was agreed upon which, when
all benefits are included, equals to approximately 70 to 80 percent of
LIFEID-i's base salary. After the retirement plan was agreed upon,
the President of the company, in a private conversation, asked LIFEUD-1
to accept a special commission as part-time investigator concerned
with acrinistrative personnel at 1,000 pesos per month. LIFEUD-1
accepted this commission.
The above action will reduce LIFEUD-1's access to the operating
centrals where most LIFEAT tap "crosses" were made. The extent of this
reduction can only be determined after LIFEUD-1 works his special
commission for a period of time. As a preliminary opinion, and not
a final decision, it is believed that LIFEUD-1's knowledge of and contacts
in the telephone company, coupled with his new position as personnel
investigator, will continue to make his contribution to the LIFEAT
project valuable and possibly unique. (See paragraph 2 E below re
security aspects of LIFEUD-1's retirement).
D. LIAISON
In late May 1963 local ODENVY requested coverage be instituted on
David DRUCKER, ODENVY is to process the take as on other ACGM coverages.
This coverage was installed 2 June 1963. No other change from that
noted in reference (b).
E. SECURITY
(1) In the security area the retirement of LIFEUD-1 and the events
surrounding it have produced two dangers to the operation which
effect both security and efficiency. The first of these involves
the reduction of LIFEAT access to the telephone centrals. Formerly
LIFEED-1 could, by calling the supervisor of any cerstral, arrange
for LIFELD-16 to enter a central, and while engaged in normal work
there establish a tap "cross" on a LIFFAT target line. Tapping
through a central is not always possible, but has become the standard
method used in LIFEAT operations. It is considered less time con-
suming and somewhat more secure than tapping through distribution
boxes. Secondly, LIFEUD-1, prior to retirement, could backstop the
presence of the LIFEAT linemen (LIFEUD-2 and LIFEUD-3) in areas of the
city outside their normal work areas while these agents worked on the
routing of the LIFEAT taps lines. LIFEUD-1's retirement diminishes
LIFEAT access to the centrals and removes the "protection" LIFEUD-1
provided to the linemen and centralman.
In a related incident during a discussion of his retirement
with LIFELD-i, it became apparent that he believed that LICOACH was
providing backup protection to the entire LIFEAT complex. LIFEUD-1
based this assumption on the fact that at one time he had discussed
providing LiFEAT with high level protection with a former LIFEAT Case
Officer and later learned that this Case Officer had visited LICOACH
on a member of occasions. From this LIFEND-1 deduced that LICOACH
was in contact with the former LIFEAT Case Officer in order to
provide protection for LIFEAT activities. LIFEUD-1 himself never

had any dealings with LICOACH other than during some investigations
which LIFFUD-1 conducted for the telephone company approximately
nine years ago. At no time has LIFEUD-1 mentioned LIFEAT operations
to LICOACH. Since LICOACH returned to his native Western European
country 1 June 1963, LIFEUD-1 will not be told that LICOACH was not
in LIFEAT employ. However, LIFEUD-1 has been reminded never to
speak with anyone about LIFEAT without first discussing it with
WILSTED.
(2) Another difficulty facing LIFEAT is the continuing improvement
in the telephone company's control of personnel movements (noted
in refs a and b). The latest development in this area requires
that an authorized "work order" be presented by any telephone
company employee who enters a central sud is not a full time
employee of that central. Any work being performed must be
witnessed by the supervisor of the central and his written report
of the work and its satisfactory completion must be entered on the
"work order". This "work order" is then filed in the company records.
This will greatly reduce LIFEAT access to the centrals, at least
from the time the work order" system is fully implemented. Personal
friendships of LIFEUD-1 and assignments of LIFEUD/2,3 and 16 to
periodic regular tours in the various centrals will give LIFEAT
some access, but most LIFEAT tap crosses will of necessity be
made in the street distribution boxes. This until such time as a
method to get around the "work order" system is developed or this
system falls of its own weight due to the Mexican "manaña" attitude.
Making crosses in distribution boxes is somewhat more risky and
more expensive, but will be an operational necessity for some time.
F. TECHNICAL
The change to making crosses in distribution boxes, which was the
original LIFEAT tap method, is the most obvious change on the operational
horizon. Technically there is no difficulty to be overcome and in some
ways this system of tapping is a simpler method of doing the job. The
increase in security risk was noted in paragraph 2 E above,
