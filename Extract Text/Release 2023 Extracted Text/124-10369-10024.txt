NOSENKO was again interviewed on 2/26/64 by SAS
DONALD E. WALTER, ALEKSO POPTANICH and MAURICE A. TAYLOR at
the same "safe house" of CIA in Fairfax, Virginia. The
source was in a much more agreeable mood on this occasion
and the interview proceeded agreeably, touching a variety
of topics, including display of a considerable number of
photographs. Source expressed concern over the welfare of
his family in the Soviet Union and stated in effect the
CIA was not able to develop any information concerning
their welfare. Source stated that it was his hope that CIA
would develop some news and expressed hope that they might
be able to do something to bring the family to the U.S.
The source stated his concern over his family has been
greatly increased over the amount of publicity he has been
receiving in the newspapers and felt this was detrimental
to him and his family. He specifically referred to the
article in the "Washington Post" on 2/26/64 and stated that
data contained in this article concerning his background was
substantially true. He stated that the source of this
information, without a doubt, was in Germany. He requested
that information from him be used with care and that at no
time should it result in any type of publicity. u)

their action, Minsk advised that they had not directed the
matter but that MARINA OSWALD'S uncle, who was a lieutenant
colonel in the local militia, had voluntarily approached
OSWALD and requested that he not be too critical of the
Soviet Union upon his return to the U.S. Source commented
that when Minsk was originally requested to furnish a summary
of OSWALD's file, they were not aware of the international
events that took place, therefore, in an attempt to ingratiate
themselves with the KGB center in Moscow, had included the
statement concerning their endeavors to influence OSWALD in
the right direction.
Source stated that the KGB was upset over the OSWALD
affair and had a staff of employees called in to work. The
file was reviewed in detail to make sure that the KGB did not
utilize OSWALD as an agent.
Inquiry was made concerning MARINA OSWALD, and
source advised that the wife of OSWALD was not in the employ
of KGB as an agent.。 He stated she was regarded as not a
particularly intelligent person, but stated she had been a
member of the Komsomol but was dropped for nonpayment of dues
over a long period. Source advised that she was permitted to
leave Russia with her husband but this was not significant
since there was no objection from KGB and that under the law
since the death of STALIN, it is possible for a Russian wife
to depart the Soviet Union with her foreign husband.
again stated that OSWALD had never worked for KGB.

NOSENKO was asked if he recalled any time within
the past few years ithat VADIM V. KOSOLAPOV had been sent from
Moscow to Helsinki in an effort to intercept and make
acquaintance with a U.S. code clerk prior to his arrival in
the Soviet Union. NOSENKO immediately recalled an incident
during the period the KGB was attempting to recruit JAMES
STORSBURG (1960–61). The KGB felt code clerks were not

Source was questioned concerning the above case
which allegedly involved recruitment of a female employee of
the American Embassy who visited the Sochi-Tbilisi area on
vacation with a female companion and was seduced, recruited
and later contacted in Moscow. Source advised after consid-
ering the facts that he did not recall such a case involving
personnel of the American Embassy but immediately speculated
that there had been such a case in the British Embassy at
Moscow. The investigation concerning FRANCES HA employee
of the British Embassy, who was compromised on the basis of
her association with one TERPSICHOROV, cameraman for Mosfilm
was discussed with NOSENKO, who expressed the opinion this
could very well be the case in question. The source did not
recognize the name TERPSICHOROV, but expressed opinion he was
an agent of KGB and observed that the case officer is prohib-
ited from any close intimate contact with female foreigners.

NOSENKO was questioned concerning the above indiv-

Directorate had no interest in MARTIN or MITCHELL prior to
the time of their arrival in the Soviet Union. He advised
he could furnish no information concerning any recruitment
or operation of these men in the U.S. Source advised after
their arrival in Moscow they were interviewed on a couple
occasions by VLADISLAV M. KOVCHUK, NIKOLAI SKVORTSOV, and
VADIM V. KOSOLAPOV, all 2nd Directorate, with KOSOLAPOV act-
ing as interpreter. Present also was one or more specialists
from the 8th Directorate (cypher)。 Source advised that he
