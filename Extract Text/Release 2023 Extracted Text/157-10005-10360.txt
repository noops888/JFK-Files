RE:
MILITARY AND NAVAS MATTERS
of the Cata Communist Party, editorialized on the stripping
of rank and position of Major PLAID AMEIJEIRAS.
AMEZJETRAS was a long-time friend of FIDEL CASTRO and the
Cuban revolution and was the first chief of the Cuban
National Revolutionary Folice. He was removed in about
1961 and giver various assignments, including a trip to
Europe which was tended to bring about his better
understanding of Communism and indoctrination with the
Festare in Brendan 13 The Verbita" ("The
same.
Little herb"), which is a rimane stemning from his
notoriety as a zarijuara smoker. 101 7-1 cailed attention
to the fact that ail of AMIERAS vices have been known
to the police long before CASTRO's savent to power, but
it is chly now that his vices, corruptness, and misconduct
form sufficient reason for nis removal from ali positions
of authority.
The editorial in "ararne" stated that this action
was due to his irresponsible contact and the great harm
he was doing to his own prestige art that of the revolution
by maintaining friendly relations with "anti-social elements,
vagabonde, and corrupt individuals". It was then noted that
AME JE RAS hai hai a close friendship and association with
former Major POTANDO CUBELAS, mentioned above as under
trial for plotting to kill FIDEL CASTRO and overthrow the
government. The article stated that the conduct of
AMEIJEIRAS was incompatible with the rank of Major in the
Rebel Army, Vice Minister of the Armed Forces, and above
all, with that of being a member of the Tentral Committee
of the Communist Farty to which he was elected in
recognition of his outstanding war record, his terrible
suffering in which he lost three brothers in the struggle,
and with the hope that he would make a maximum effort to
overcome his defects":

which the head of the Cuban Novernment now appears to place
in these three persons, especially HART and SLANUSA, whom
they consider to be riding on the victor's "band wagon"
