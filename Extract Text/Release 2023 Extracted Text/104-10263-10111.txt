26 January 1965
SUBJECT: Antilles Material Company Limited (AMCO) -
Meeting with SKEWER/1 on the Relationship
of the Puerto Rican Cement Company to AMCO
2,λε agrees in his li January 1965 meeting with
SKEWER/1, Hr. Edward Stanulis telephoned SKEWER/I on the
morning of 18 January to arrange a meeting with SKEWER/1
at his convenience later in the day. SKEWER/1 suggested
a meeting at 1500 hours that afternoon in his office at
He indicated to
the
Mr. Stanulis that the Puerto ucan cement Company looks
with favor on AMCO and is doing business with it through
its Manager, Mr. Alvin T. Philpotts, Jr.
and
2. Prior to the meeting, Messrs. Allen,
Stanulis reviewed the approach to be made to SKEWER/1 in
the light of his favorable view of AMCO. It was agreed.
that no mention would be made of the fact that AMCO is in
poor financial condition or that Mr. Philpotte is inade-
quate as a manager. Stress would be laid upon assessment
of the long-term commercial viability of AMCO because
KUBARK is ostensibly interested in
a managerial position in AMCO, or some other similar firm,
in order to monitor Castro's activities in the Caribbean
area.
3. Messrs. Allen,
and Stanults arrived pre-
cisely at 1500 hours at SKEWER's office on the second floor
of tho
His male secretary asked
us to take seats in the corridor outside his office.
Within a few minutes his "sacretary reappeared and asked us
to wait in the Conference Room. Some ten minutes later
SKEWER/1 appeared and invited us into his private office.
He war extremely cordial and gracious. Mr. Stanulis intro-
duced Mr. Allen as a colleague who is assessing AMCO's com-
mercial viability. He introduced
as a lawyer
consultant who is obtaining background Information in the
event KUBARK should decide to proceed

4. Mr. Allen informed SKEWER/1 that SUBARK is assessing
the factors bearing on the long-term commercial viability
of AMCO.
One of the factors bearing on the commercial via-
bility of AMCO is the relationship of the Puerto Rican
Cement Company with AMCO and the terms of any agreements.
We would also like his views on commodities other than
cement wirici can be siιμρού τα uesto co to the outer
islands and what commodities can be shipped on return
voyages. Another factor of interest is competition in the
shipping field.
5. SKEVER/1 indicated that he needed some clarifi-
cation of KUBARK objectives. Mr. Stanulis reviewed KUBARK
for the purpose..
✓of checking on Castro activities in the Caribbean area.
SKEWER/1 assumed that Mr. Fhilpotts was the man in whom
we are interested. Mr. Allen dispelled this assumption.
explaininst that KUBARK has a candidate whom we would like
to place

if it is..ceter-
KUBARK WOuld seek
who,
like SKEWER/1, has helped KÜBARK in the past and would
undoubtedly help again. SKEWER/1 said, "Oh, yes, through
in the company." He then asked if Mr. Thilpotts
would know of KUBARK interest. Mr. Allen replied no,
emphasizing that our interest should be closely held.
:
6. SKEWER/1 said that he had not realized that we
wanted so much detail and asked if we desired to talk with
the man in his company most familiar with ANCO. Mr. Stanulis
declined, emphasizing that we wanted to keep our interest
in this matter confined solely to SKEWER/1. SKEWER/1 1m-
mediately agreed to make the necessary telephone calls to
obtain answers to our questions. As the basis for his
Inquiry, he would ask about the amount of credit extenced
by the Puerto Rican Cement Company to AMCO. SKEWER/L then
made a series of telephone calls to one of his subordinates
named Touns and also made one call to his son.
Information was obtained in the above telephone calls:
The following
a. AMCO has 2 or 3 ships under charter and ships
primarily coment to Martinque, Guadaloupe, Barbados,
and Antigue,
SECRET

b. The uerto Rican Cement Company has a
verbal agreement with r. Thilpotts granting him
exclusive distribution of cement in Guadaloupe,
Barbados, and Antigua,
c. AMCO currently owes the Nuerto Rican
Cement Company $40,000 and is slow in payment.
d. The normal procedure for payment is for
the consignee to pay Mr. Philpotts by & note which
the Puerto Rican Cement Company discounts.
e. The Puerto Rican Cement Company is currently
examining how much credit it can extend to ANCO.
In this connection the company is examining whether
credit extended to AMCO can be insured under the
Foreign Credit Insurance Association. (FCIA insures
80% of export credit.) If so, the risk to the
Puerto Rican Cement Company would be reduced and
further credit could be extended.
f. The Puerto Rican Cement Company has sold
133,000 bags of cement to AMCO.
:
7. SKEWER/1 said that Mr. Philpotts is aggressive
and that he is pushing Fuerto Rican cement.
csked SKEWER/1 if his firm were worried about the amount
of credit extended to AMCO. SKEWER/1 replied that AMCO
is trying to help the Puerto Rican Cement Company and
Puerto Rican Cement is in turn trying to help ANCO.
SKEWER/1 imparted the impression that he has absolute
confidence in his subordinates. In calling Tomas, SKEWER/1
said to us that he had gone over the head of his son.
SKEWER/1 was not aware that ANCO Puerto Rico is a subsidiary
of AMCO Panama. en apprised of this fact, he said that
this arrangement is probably for tax purposes. SKEWER/1
left the impression that he considers MMCO as a Puerto Rican
company and one worthy of support. He recalled that he had
previously given a job to a Trujillo opponent, Fred Imbert,
whom no one else would hire, Mr, Imbert now has his om
shipping company and SKEWER/1 suggested that we assess his
operation. He recalled that Mr. Trujillo had telephoned him
about harboring a criminal. SKEWER/I told Trujillo to mind
his own business as would SKEWER/L. Mr. Stanulis indicated
that KURARK would not want to consider Fred Imbert's opera-
tion, given his family's involvement in the Dominican
Republic. Throughout the conversation, the picture emerged
of a man who trusts his subordinates and who would help an
individual or fim, particularly fuerto Rican, which is also
trying to help his firm.

revealed this information to S/L in the ovent
that it should be deemed desirable for

versely, in the event of ACO's failure, it was felt
that SREWER/1 should know that and is it Gamected
with any other participants. SKEWER/1 offered full
cooperation. ile had arranged his schedule to give us
as much time as necessary. In our presence he received
a telephone call in which he apologized for cancelling
an appointment in order to accommodate us. It is
considered that, as in his past relations with KUBARK,
SKEWER/1 can be trusted and will help KUBARK in any way
he can.

SUBJECT:
Project WUBRINY--Antilles Materials Company, Ltd.,
Discussion by Mr. Edward Stanulis with SKEWER/1.
1. I made initial telephonic contact with SKEWER/1 at approximately
1100 hours on 10 January 1965 and made arrangements for a meeting in my
hotel room for the following day between the hours of 1600 and 1700 to be
followed by another on Tuesday at a time and place that would be convenient
for SKEWER/1. Later in the day SKEWER/1 informed me that he would be
mmable to meet with us on Tuesday as he was leaving by air on the evening
of 11 January for a series of appointments in the States.
2. The meeting with SKEWER/1 was held in my hotel room at 1645
hours on 11 January. I told SKEWER/1 that as he knew, one of KUBARK'S
prime information targets in Latin America concerned the activities of
Castro's Cuba and that in this connection some of our people had been
thinking for some time that it would be most useful in pursuing this require-
ment to have entree into shipping interests that were active in Caribbean
waters, SKEWER/I said he thought this idea excellent. i further stated
that those people had heard that SKEWER/l's firm was discussing the possi-
bility of entering into an exclusive Caribbean distributorship contract with
Alvin T. Philpotts, Jr., who is associated with the Antilles Materials
Company, Ltd. S. A. of Panama and Puerto Rico, and asked him if he had
any knowledge of the individual or the negotiations. SKEWER/I replied
that he did not know of either, but that his son would be familiar with both.
3. I asked SKEWER/1 if he would be willing to investigate the situ-
ation discreetly without mentioning any interest on KUBARK's part and a
the same time consider the commercial feasibility of the venture for AMCO.
He agreed...
In elaborating on the basic concept, I told SKEWER/1 that if the
SKEWER/1 reiterated his conviction
that the concept is an excellent one and said he would do all in his power to

help KUBARK achieves this objective.
5. I told him that I would appreciate his cooperation in meeting
with two of my friends who are more fully versed in these matters.
He agreed and set the meeting for Monday, 19 January 1965. SKEWER/1
gave me his unlisted private telephone numier and suggested that I con-
tact him Monday morning, 19 January 1965, to set time and place for
the meeting. The number is 842-2120.

would also enable him to investigate thoroughly the
status of negotiations with AMCO.
