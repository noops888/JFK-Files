Cuban leadership, some time ago we targeted Juana Castro Ruz,
half-sister of Fideland Raul Castro Ruz. A number of reports

proceeded to Havana where she maintained frequent contact
with Juana Castro Ruz and other prominent Cuban leaders until

soon as possible in order that we may attempt. a direct re-
cruitment. You will be kept advised of any future develop-
ments of importance in this case.
