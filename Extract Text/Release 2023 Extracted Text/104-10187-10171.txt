an OFFICIAL Japanese SERVICE
1. WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING DIFFICULTY IN GETTING AN OFFICIAL Japanese
TO ASSIGN ADDITIONAL MEN TO THE NYXIS TEAM.
SOME TIME AGO WE WERE TOLD THAT THE TEAM WOULD BE INCREASED BY 3, BUT SO FAR
HE HAS FAILED TO COME THROUGH. THE ADDITIONAL WORK LOAD RECENTLY
PLACED ON THE PRESENT TEAM HAS CAUSED A PROPORTIONATE DECREASE IN
EFFICIENCY. BECAUSE WE WERE TOLD THAT WHEN THE TEAM MEMBERSHIP
IS INCREASED WE WILL HAVE MORE TIME TO WORK EXCLUSIVELY ON THE
CUBAN TARGET, WE ARE, OF COURSE, ANXIOUS FOR AN INCREASE IN
PERSONNEL.
2. IT IS FORTHCOMING THAT AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON THE CUBAN IS
RELATIVELY SCARCE. COUNTRIES WITH WHICH CUBA HAS DIPLOMATIC
RELATIONS TREAT THIS INFORMATION IN SUCH A MANNER THAT EMBASSY PERSONNEL ARE
NOT ABLE TO OBTAIN IT EASILY. IT WOULD ALSO BE HELPFUL IF
WE COULD UTILIZE CP'S OF
THE HOST COUNTRY FOR OPERATIONAL PURPOSES. IT IS HOPED THAT
THIS INFORMATION WILL HAVE THE DESIRED EFFECT OF 1/ MAKING
HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIALS AWARE OF THE THREAT POSED BY THE
CUBAN EFFORTS IN GENERAL, 2/ WITH THE FURTHER WISH THAT
THIS INFORMATION WILL REACH HIGHER GOVERNMENTAL ECHELONS, AND
3/ PROMOTING THE ASSIGNING THE EXTRA MEN TO THE NYXIS
TEAM.
