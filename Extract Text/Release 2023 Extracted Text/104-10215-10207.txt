1. According to a militia truck driver, great quantities of pistols, rifles,
submachine guns and ammunition are stored at a building at Calle 12 and
Malecon in Vedado, Havana. Quantities of arms and ammunition are also
stored in the basement of the building housing the Centro Asturiano and in
a building at the corner of Oficios and Obrapia, behind the General Staff
building. The General Staff building is guarded by members of the Union
de Jovenes Comunistas (Union of young Communists).
2. According to Captain Waldo Martinez, a Communist, the tank unit in the
block between Calles 23 and 25, and J and L, is under the command of
Rolando Cubela, the unit is composed of students of the University of
Havana.
3. At the Central Macareno near Santa Cruz del Sur there was firing which
lasted about one hour, the cause of which was unknown. Troops were called
in from the city of Camaguey to isolate the zone. The incident may have
involved a clash between insurgents in the "Pedregal" area of Central
Francisco and the militia from the Central Macareno.
4. In early July 1962 a military convoy was stationed along the Carretera
Central in Matanzas Province, some nine miles before reaching Perico.
The convoy had transported a company of troops who were dispersed in
the underbrush.
5. There are large powder magazines in the town of La Plata and at Niras del
Frio in the Sierra Maestra, Oriente Province.
