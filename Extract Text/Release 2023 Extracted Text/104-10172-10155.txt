An official British service from "a regular source, quoting Jovan Miric,
correspondent in Cuba of TANJUO, Yugoslav press agency."
Appraisal of Content: 3..
1. The militia is no longer regarded by the Cuban Government as a serious
factor in internal or external defense. Instead, it is used as a recruiting
ground for the Armed Forces, which are now thoroughly professional and
well-trained.
2. Armed clashes between opposition groups and government forces have occurred
in several provinces, including Matanzas, Camaguey, and Pinar del Rio.
3. There has been a notable increase in sabotage since February or March 1962.
Buildings and factories have been blown up or burned, cane fields set on
fire, and above all, passive resistance has grown in certain industries,
especially the sugar refining industry. A different pattern of sabotage
has emerged. Instead of setting off explosive or incendiary bombs where
they might cause loss of life or injury, thus arousing popular resentment
against the opposition, targets are chosen for the maximum financial damage
or dislocation.
