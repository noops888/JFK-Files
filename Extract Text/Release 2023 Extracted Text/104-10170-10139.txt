folder 14 MHZ 618 o September 1945
1.
a. While still at Kyankpyn Major Charles J. TREES
and Captain Carrol C. GARRETSON called HOUTS to their
tent. (TREES was HOUTS' Commanding Officer and GARRETSON
was Executive Officer to TREES.) TREES stated that GARRETSON
had discovered fifty-one. 45 calibre automatic pistols at
Chittagong which were "charged out to no one." TREES and
GARRETSON believed they could get a "good amount" of money
from the sale of the weapons, but they wanted HOUTS' advice so
they wouldn't get caught. (HOUTS had been in the FBI). They
offered HOUTS one-third of the profit and, after several days,
he agreed.
b. On the night of 3-4 July 1945 HOUTS assisted in the
clandestine delivery of the pistols to a Lt. Col. Tun Aung, a
Burmese officer in the "Burma Rifles" for burial, until a market
could be found.
c. On 15 July 1945 HOUTS was questioned by the OSS
investigator and assisted him in the recovery of the pistols.
2. During the first week that HOUTS was in Rangoon an informer
told him that 90 swords had been buried in the compound of A. Habeeb.
At GARRETSON's direction and expense HOUTS had the swords cleaned.
On 25 May 1945 HOUTS delivered them to TREES' quarters. On 13 July
1945 TREES quarters were searched and 36 swords were found and
confiscated by OSS. (Several classified documents were also found in
TREES durile bag.)
3. TREES. GARRETSON and personnel under their command
misappropriated property (jewelry and old books) during the first two
weeks of the occupation of Rangoon.
4. Six OSS personnel were killed in a plane crash early in June.
Three parachutes were recovered from the crashed plane. GARRETSON
and HOUTS had pajamas and other articles of clothing tailored from the
parachutes.
5. 18 Spring 1945 TREES and GARRETSON were involved in the
illegal sale of opium.

Cuban citizen. Refugee who left Cuba in January 1961.
His was employed by Consolidated Railroads of Cuba for abt 20 years.
The source of this information is normally available for further
interrogation, should this report generate additional requirements.
1. I am 45 years old and I started working in November 1945 as an office
clerk in the Havana office of the Guantanamo Western Railroad Company.
In 1953 I was elected Vice President of the Consolidated Railways of
Cuba, the Cuba Railroad and the Cuba Northern Railroad. In February
1954 I was elected President of the Guantanamo Western and Vice
President of the Cuba Railroad and the Cuban Northern Railroad. In June
1953 I was elected President of the Consolidated Railways of Cuba and
I held this position until October 1959 when the railroads were confiscated
by the Cuban Government by Law Decree No. 80. I finally left Cuba
on 4 Jan 61.
2. Q. Can you tell me what was the length of the Cuba lines operated by
common carriers in Cuba and what was the total length of all branch
lines combined?
A. I can only speak for the mileage of the Consolidated Railways of
Cuba, which ran from Santa Clara to Camaguey to Santiago de Cuba to
Guantanamo. I would say that the main line and the branches combined
would be 1400 plus miles.
3. Q. What weight of rail is most common on main lines? That is, how
heavy are most main-line rails and are tie plates commonly used?
A. I would say the most commonly used rail is 85 lbs per yard. About
5 per cent of the main line has 125 lbs per yard. About 75 per cent
has 85 lbs per yard. The approximate age of steel is 15 to 20 years.
Tie plates are commonly used.

4. Q. How many ties exist per kilometer of main lines? What type of ties are
used? Are ties treated; if so, in what manner? What is the average life of
ties in mainline service? Can you give an estimate of the average age of
ties now in the main line?
A. To the best of my recollection, there are close to three thousand ties
per kilometer of main line. The ties are of hard wood but they are not treated.
The average life of the ties is about 15 years and I would say that the
average age of the ties now in the main line is about 15 years.
5. Q. Locate and indicate size of principal freight classification yards and other
freight yards.
A. Our main classification yards were at Santa Clara, Camaguey, Moron,
Santiago de Cuba, and Guantanamo.
6. Q. Locate and describe the principal repair shops for steam and for diesel
locomotives.
A. We had complete repair shops for both steam and diesel locomotives in the
eastern outskirts of Camaguey City. As a matter of fact, these shops are
shown on the map of Camaguey City which appears on the road map of Cuba
published by Esso Standard Oil, S.A. in 1956.
7. Q. Locate and describe the principal repair shops for freight and passenger cars.
A. The same shops in Camaguey City were used for the repair of freight and
passenger cars. The Consolidated Railways of Cuba did all of their own repairs
and in addition they did work for various sugar mills in the area.
8. Q. Is any part of the system electrified?
A. No.
9. Q. Is there a division between lines operated by diesel and steam motive power?
A. No. The Consolidated Railways of Cuba had 84 diesels and six steam engines.
The six steam engines were used more or less for emergency work.
10. Q. What is the number and total length of tunnels?
A. There are no tunnels on the system.
11. Q. State the number of locomotives in each major category, of diesel, steam
and electric; and, insofar as possible, break the totals down by horsepower,
type and country of origin.
A. As I have stated, we had 84 diesel engines and six steam engines. I do not
remember the details about these but I know that some of the diesels were
1000 horsepower, some 900 and some 600 to 650 horsepower (see 00-K-323/01953).
12. Q. Please give the number of passenger cars and the number of freight cars.
A. I’m afraid that I cannot give you accurate figures. I know that we had over
two thousand freight cars but I do not remember the exact number nor do I
remember the number of passenger cars. See 00-K-323/01953. The “on file”
material contains this information.
13. Q. Were any passenger or freight cars equipped with roller bearings?
A. Yes, some, but I do not remember how many.
14. Q. Are diesel locomotives operated in multiple?
A. Yes, but not always; it depends on the weight of the train and the
grade of the line.

15. Q. Does each freight train carry a caboose on its rear end?
A. Yes.
16. Q. What is the average and maximum speed of passenger trains between stops?
A. Maximum speed was 50 miles per hour and average of not more than 30
miles per hour.
17. Q. Can you give the number of employees of the common carrier railroads?
Is there a seasonal variation in employment?
A. I can only speak for the Consolidated Railways of Cuba which had over
10 thousand employees. There was a seasonal variation but it was very slight.
18. Q. Can you describe the main freight haulage pattern of the railway system
of Cuba? Indicate major commodities and direction of movement.
A. I can speak only for the Consolidated Railways of Cuba. The main traffic
was on the Cuba Railroad and the Western Railroad of Cuba. The heaviest traffic
was from Camaguey to Nuevitas. The Consolidated Railways of Cuba handled
one-third of the Cuban sugar crop, so that most of the traffic was from the
sugar mills to the coast. However, the railway also handled cattle, rice,
vegetables and oil and other commodities.
19. Q. What is the average length of haul? (This was stated in a 1952 report
as 36.3 kilometers.)
A. I would say that in 1960 it was about the same as in 1952.
20. Q. What are the principal routes of passenger movement? How dense are
such movements?
A. I would say to and from Havana. I would estimate that in this traffic
the railroads carried about six thousand passengers per day.
21. Q. Is daily commutation a significant factor in the movement of passengers.
A. It is not a significant factor.
22. Q. In less-than-carload movement of relative importance is the total
movement of Cuban freight?
A. I would say that it is not very important.
23. Q. With respect to imports and exports, what ports are used for greatest
interchange of tonnage, between the railroads and ocean shipping? To what
extent are these same ports or any others used for interchange with coastwise
shipping?
A. Speaking for the Consolidated Railways of Cuba, I would say Nuevitas,
Cienfuegos, Manzanillo, Santiago de Cuba, Boqueron, Antilla, Santa Cruz del Sur,
and Casilda. I would say that any interchange with coastwise shipping is
insignificant.
24. Q. In what condition are the principal highways of Cuba?
A. There is only one main highway on the island which runs practically the
entire length of the island from Pinar del Rio to Havana to Santiago de Cuba.
This highway was in poor condition when I left Cuba in 1961.
25. Q. What commodities are moved by motor transport and coastal shipping?
A. Sugar, wood and general commodities.

26. Q. What is the general pattern and direction of flow of this traffic?
A. From country to cities.
27. Q. What considerations determine the selection of the means of transport
for the major commodities used?
A. Price, time, nature of commodity, and facilities.
28. Q. What pipelines, if any, are located in Cuba?
A. None to my knowledge.
