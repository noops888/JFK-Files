On 4/22/67 at 3:50 p.m. Legat, Mexico City, called
with regard to cablegran he sent 4/21/67 in captioned matter.
Recab stated that nevepaper in Mexico City reported arrival
of New Orleans District Attorney Janes Garrison in Mexico
and Legat's source in Mexican Federal Security Police requested
any information indicating Garrison intended to investigate
captioned matter in Mexico and reasons for Garrison's presence
in Mexico.
When Legat called, he stated that newspapers are
printing conflicting stories. He said some say Garrison is
in Mexico while others say he is in New Orleans. Legat
requested to be advised if our New Orleans Office could stato
that Garrison was actually in New Orleans which would solve
many problems since Legat is under terrific pressure from
his cources. He requested to be telephonically advised eon-
cerning this matter.
New Orleans vas telephonically contacted and we
were advised that the news articles in New Orleans reported
rumors that, Garrison was in Mexico. However, this was denied
by Garrisons financial backer Willard Robertson who apparently
is in Acapulco, Mexico. It was further denied by Garrison's
office. This information was furnished to the Legal Attache
telephonically with instructions that he should be meticu-
lously careful to avoid being involved in any facete of the
Garrison investigation.

Subject, now in Jamaica and possibly mentally
deranged, claims to be planning revolution to overthrow
government of Jamaica with assistance of unidentified
United States "syndicate" and help from Communist Cuba.
We are initiating investigation into his activities while
he was in the United States, 1953-1966, for benefit of
Jamaican police. For information.
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has been
advised by [Special Branch, Jamaica Police Service, that (U)
Evans, a Negro Jamaican national, vas picked up at sea in
small boat between Jamaica and Cuba, lost and out of fuel
and food, in September, 1966. He claimed to be in the
process of attempting to rendezvous with unidentified Cubans
with whom he planned to travel to Cuba to collect funds to
be used in the overthrow of the Jamaican Government. Such
funds were to be used to send organized groups of Jamaicans
to Cuba for training for this purpose. Evans claimed to be
working with a "syndicate" in the United States which is
to finance a communist revolution in Jamaica. He claimed
this is the same "syndicate" which in the United States
had caused Jack Ruby to kill Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassin
of President Kennedy. Evans further claimed to be enlisting
aid of Jamaican criminal element to organize an extortion
racket to shake down some 100 off-track betting shops in
Jamaica, proceeds from which were to be used in revolution.
Evans claims to be a film director, educated in
the United States where he lived from 1953 to 1966. Jamaican
police found evidence he had lived in New York City under
an alias and entered Jamaica in September, 1966, using false
documentation. He maintained he had engaged in civil rights
activities while in the United States. His German-born wife
and child reportedly lived in Binghamton, New York, until
January, 1967, when they joined him in Jamaica. Investigation
to date by Jamaican authorities has failed to substantiate
any of Evans' claims and his true identity is still in doubt.

Memorandum to Mr. W. C. Sullivan
Re: JOHN EVANS
Information furnished concerning Evans indicates
he may well be mentally unbalanced. Despite this, his
claimed connection with a United States "syndicate" which
caused Ruby to kill Oswald and his alleged major involve-
ment in a plan to overthrow the Jamaican Government with
Cuban and "syndicate" assistance along with his indicated
13-year residence in the United States dictate that we
conduct investigation in effort to determine his activities
while in this country. [CIA intends to pass to Special
Branch, Jamaica Police Service, pertinent results of our
inquiries (U)
Bureau files contain no information identifiable
with Evans. By separate letter, New York and Albany being
instructed to initiate investigation. Other offices covering
Evans' claimed United States residences instructed to review
their files and police and credit records. Pertinent results,
appropriately cleared for_passage to Jamaican authorities,
will be furnished to CIA for rolay to Jamaica Police Service (U)
ACTION:
None. For information.
