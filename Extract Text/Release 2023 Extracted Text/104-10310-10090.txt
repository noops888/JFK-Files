SSC Request
REFERENCE:
RS 76-0083/A (14 January 1976)
1. Re question number 1 of reference: Attachment "A" contains
the names of Agency personnel who were in Mexico City, Mexico, during
the period 1 September 1963 through 31 December 1963 and who are still
on duty. Attachment "B" contains the names of Agency personnel who
were in Mexico City during this same period but are now retired or no
longer on duty. It is understood that these attachments will be
retained in the Headquarters building for use by the Committee Staff.
2. Re question number 3(a) of reference: For your background,
the Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil (DRE) was a Cuban student
exile entity founded in September 1960 as an anti-Communist revolutionary
organization dedicated to the overthrow of the Castro regime. The parent
organization of the DRE was the Directorio Revolucionario (DR), a revolu-
tionary organization of Cuban students opposed to the Batista regime
which actively joined the Castro forces by organizing a guerrilla move-
ment which contributed greatly to the collapse of the Batista regime.
The Castro government, themselves of student origin, recognized the DR
power and by-passed them politically by forming the new regime without
their participation. The original DR became Communist controlled and
directed. While the Agency had no role in the founding, the DRE was an
entity used by the CIA as a unilateral asset in pursuing U.S. policy
objectives. CIA support to the DRE ceased on 30 September 1966 and formally
terminated on 1 January 1967. At that time DRE files were reviewed and
material dealing with CIA support and operations were either destroyed
or turned over the JMWAVE Station. The DRE was expected to continue as
an organizational entity and continue its activities independent of CIA.
3. The DRE files of both Station JMWAVE and Headquarters that are
available have been reviewed and Lee Harvey Oswald's name does not appear
in these files. WAVE cable 8049 (in 66782) of 22 November 1963, states
in the third sentence, "according AMSPELL files, Oswald", undoubtedly
refers to the DRE files maintained in the DRE office in Miami, Florida.

These entity files were independent of the JMWAVE Station files. Had
Station JMWAVE referred to its files in WAVE 8049 the cable would have
been worded, "according AMSPELL Station files." The file of AMHINT-53,
a former executive of the DRE, has also been reviewed and no reference
to Oswald was found. The file number which appears on WAVE 8049 is no
longer in use and the contents of this former_file were transferred
into Oswald's and other 201 files by the CI Staff. A tape of the radio
debate cited in WAVE 8049 is included in the Oswald 201 held by the CI
Staff.
4. Re question number 3(b) of reference: We have been unable-to
determine if Station JMWAVE was instructed to review its files for
information on Oswald. For many years the CI Staff has been the focal
point for the collation of any and all information concerning Oswald
and if the JAWAVE files on any Cuban groups contained information on
Oswald such information should be reflected in Oswald 201 file.
