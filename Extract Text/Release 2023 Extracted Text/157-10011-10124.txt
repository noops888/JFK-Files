SUBJECT: Interview with William Harvey (conducted September 14, (UCC)
1975)
LUMUMBA'S ACTUAL DEATH
1.
I do not know of any connection between the CIA and Lumumba's
actual death.
LUMUMBA PLOTS
2.
I never heard of poison being sent from the CIA to the Congo
station, nor did I ever hear of any CIA assassination mission
in the Congo. I am almost sure that 10 Donnell never told me
that he had learned that there were poisons in the Congo.
JUSTIN ONDONNELL/QJWIN CONGO MISSION
3. The only mention of assassinating Lumumba that I recall is
O'Donnell's conversation with me.
4. Justin O'Donnell only told me that he had agreed to go to the
Congo to discredit Lumumba and that he had refused to undertake
an assassination mission which Richard Bissell attempted to
give him.
5.
I did not debrief O'Donnell when he returned from the Congo.
So I did not learn from him what the nature of his mission was.
6. O'Donnell's activities in the Congo were not a Staff D opera-
tion. Despite the fact that the memo of January 11, 1960
mentions that "QJWIN was being used for FI/D purposes," QJWIN's
mission in the Congo was not a Staff D operation. Rather, it
was an African Division operation. I merely loaned O'Donnell
NW 50955 DocId:32203892 Page 3

to the African Division. In turn, QJWIN was loaned by my
deputy, it is possible that Arnold Silver might not know
exactly what QJWIN did in the Congo because Silver may simply
have arranged for WIN to be placed under the supervision of
Justin O'Donnell and sent to the Congo.
8. The use of the phrase "FI/D purposes" in the memo of January 11,
1960 was purely an administrative device to secure funding for
QJWIN and allow for accounting out of Staff D funds. I am
almost 100% sure that there was no actual FI/D assignment.
9. It is possible. that ODonnell may have used QJWIN to aid in a
survey of FI/D opportunities in the Congo. That was O'Donnell's
training and most Staff D officers would make such a survey
even when they were on other assignment. But this was nota)
Primary purpose Of O. Dommell's trip. Rather, the primary purpose
of O'Donnell's trip was to undertake an operation against
Lumumba.
10. The specific nature of QJWIN's assignment in the Congo was
11.
probably worked out between Armold Silves, and Justin O'Donnell
QJWIN was first recruited by Arnold Silver, while Silver was
Chief of Station in Luxembourg and before Silver was assigned
to me in FI/D. After Arnold Silver joined Staff D, he told me
that he thought QJWIN could_be_useful in breaking and entering (7
Foperations Also, we_used QJWIN for spotting Corsican assets

12. Shortly after Arnold Silver came back from Luxembourg and
perhaps before he was actually assigned to Staff D Silver
and I discussed QJWIN and his potential utility.
13. In Arnold Silver's early use of OJWIN as a spotter of assets
for Staff Droperations, QJWIN was told to "spot" people who
could do breaking and entering to obtain documents. He was
probably also told that he should spot
people who were capable
of obtaining documents or packages from couriers.
14. QJWIN's instructions for asset spotting did not change at all
after Project ZRRIFLE was established as far as I know. Arnold
Silver continued to be the intermediary between myself and
QJWIN. I never met QJWIN.
15. QJWIN was not permitted to make a single recruitment as far
as I know.
16. The lengthy handwritten notes which appear in the QJWIN/ZRRIFLE
file (a xeroxed version of a spiral notebook) were probably
written by Arnold Silver in the course of debriefing QJWIN
on his asset spotting. This is a deduction on my part based
17.
upon the handwriting and the terminology used in these notes.
If there was any CIA mission to kidnap Lumumba from UN custody
and turn him over to Mobutu, I did not know of it. I do not
think anyone would be naive enough to think that if Lumumba
were turned over to Mobutu, he would live through it.
18. As far as I know, QJWIN was entirely run by O'Donnell at this
point. In other words, I do not know of any independent lines
of responsibility or reporting that QJWIN had to other people
in the CIA station in the Congo or to anyone on Staff D.
10
NW 50955 DocId:32203892 Page 5

19.
As far as I knew, neither 0 Donnell nor QJWIN ever had an assassi-
nation mission.
20. If QJWIN were to be used on an assassination mission, it would
have been cleared with me. I was never informed that he was
to be used for such a mission.
Nor did I ever discuss any such
mission with him as far as I know.
21.
I was kept informed of the arrangements for QJWIN's trip to
the Congo and, subsequently, of his presence in the Congo.
do not know specifically what QJWIN did in the Congo.
I
I do
not think that I ever had such knowledge.
22.
I was shown a CIA cable to Director from Frankfurt, IN 36814,
dated November 2, 1960 regarding QJWIN's mission to the Congo
which reads, in the first paragraph: "He accepted offer.
Proceed Leopoldville. Precise mission not conveyed to him.
He only informed that mission might involve large element of
personal risk." Arnold, Silver probably wrote this cable.
This cable does not indicate any particular kind of operation,
like an assassination mission, because anyone going to the
Congo at this time would have assumed a great risk if they
were undertaking any kind of operation against Lumumba.
23. The memorandum of November 2, 1960 to the Chief of Station,
Dakar, and the Chief of Station, Luxembourg, from the Chief,
(probably
KUTUBE/D was a memorandum I read and approved at the time it
was issued. KUTUBE/D was a cryptonym for FI/Staff D, of which I
was Chief_in_1960.0
V
24. The memorandum indicates that Daniel M. Presland was the re-
leasing officer. Daniel M. Presland was my pseudonym.
I
probably released this memorandum, although I cannot be certain.

NW 50955 DocId: 32203892 Page 6

25.
This memorandum originated fin Staff. D. It was probably written,
for my signature, by Arnold Silver, who would have been
sufficiently familiar with the operational details to be the
author.
26.
I do remember the dispatch of QJWIN to the Congo, the subject
to which this memorandum refers.
27. Dakar Mission: I do recall that QJWIN was to go to Dakar
Senegal at some point as indicated in the QJWIN file, but I
do not recall the nature of the mission. Nor do I know
whether QJWIN actually went to Dakar. I am almost certain
that this was not connected in any way to an assassination
mission. I do not_recall whether the mission to Dakar concerned
the spotting of assets, but Dakar would be a logical place for
Casset spotting activity because it is a cosmopolitan port.
28. After reviewing the Memorandum for the Finance Division from
"William K. Harvey, Chief, (FI/Division D" dated January 11, 1960
which concerns QJWIN's trip to the Congo, it appears to me
that this memorandum was written for my signature by Arnold
Silver
29.
I do not know what was to be signified by the note in my memo
of January 11, 1960: "In order to avoid any misunderstanding,
it should be noted that QJWIN was sent on this trip for a
specific highly sensitive operational purpose which has been
completed." I do not know what "completed" would have meant,
but I assume it must have referred to the fact that 0 Donnell
had returned from the Congo.
NW 50955 DocId: 32203892 Page 7

30.
This memorandum of January 11, 1960 does not reflect any first-
hand knowledge on my part of the nature of Donnell's mission
in the Congo.
WIROGUE
31. Mr. Baron showed me the cable of December 17, 1960 from
Leopoldville to CIA headquarters concerning an approach by
WIROGUE to QJWIN for the purpose of recruiting QJWIN for "an
execution squad." I do have a vague recollection that QJWIN
was approached in the Congo in connection with a "direct
action" operation.
But it is my impression that this was an
incident involving free-wheeling by an agent, rather than an
assassination mission.
ZRRIFLE/ROSELLI OPERATION
32. Project ZRRIFLE was used for funding the Roselli operation.
Project ZRRIFLE, which began as the development of an Executive
Action capability, was later used for the accounting for the
Roselli operation. This was for the purpose of the convenience
of vouchering whatever expenses were involved and to ensure
security. This enabled me to keep the general Task Force W
operations separate from the Roselli operation.
NW 50955 DocId: 32203892 Page 8

33.
The question of "reactivation" of the Roselli operation in
November 1961. In November of 1961, Richard Bissell asked me
to take over the Roselli contact. Richard Bissell's testimony,
as represented to me by Mr. Baron, that Roselli was viewed as
an "inactive contact" at that time is exactly contrary to my
recollection. I recall that Bissell simply asked me to take
over the Sheffield Edwards operation. This was not a revival
of anything that had been terminated or put on ice. The
operation had never stopped. There was no indication in any
of my talks with Richard Bissell that the Roselli operation
was dormant. But in fairness to Bissell, I don't know that he
ever said precisely that it was an ongoing operation. The
impression I received from Bissell, however, was that it was
indeed an ongoing operation. There was nothing said to the
contrary. My subsequent talks with Edwards, O'Connell, and
Roselli indicated that the operation was active. But I do not
know how close Bissell was to the operation and exactly what
he knew about it. It may have been his impression that the
operation was inactive. Whatever language Bissell used with
me, it was clear to me that the operation was ongoing and that
I was to do whatever I could with it. It was also clear from
my first conversation with Roselli that the operation had never
been called off. Jim O'Connell also indicated to me that he
was still in contact with Roselli. Shortly after my discussion
with Bissell of my takeover of the Roselli contact, I discussed
the Roselli operation with Edwards. The only reason for the
NW 50955 DocId: 32203892 Page 9
6
-8-
hiatus in activity in the Roselli operation between November
of 1961 and my meeting with Roselli in New York in April of 1962
was the intensity of my other responsibilities at the CIA.
During this period, I had to set up Task Force W, including
recruiting its members. I also had to continue the ongoing
Cuban operations and write frequent memos to Lansdale and
Robert Kennedy on these subjects. When I was requested to take
over the Roselli operation, I assessed it and determined that
the operation should be terminated because it had little chance
of success. But because of the tremendous repercussion potential,
I delayed the termination. I subsequently terminated the Roselli
operation as soon as feasible after the missile crisis in
October of 1962. It would have been terminated earlier except
that during the crisis I could not cut off any potential asset.
Had I been given the original assignment of removing Castro,
this is not the way I would have done it.
34. Authorization through Bissell. At no time did I or anyone else
connected with the Castro assassination operation (Helms, Edwards,
O'Connell and Roselli) ever have the slightest doubt that this
was fully authorized. But my sense of the existence of this
authorization came solely from my conversations with Richard
Bissell. I had no other direct information about the source
of authorization for the operation.
NW 50955 DocId: 32203892 Page 10

35. Robert Kennedy. I never discussed the Roselli operation with
Robert Kennedy nor with anyone outside the CIA except for
John Roselli.
ZRRIFLE/RICHARD BISSELL
36. My initial discussion with Richard Bissell about establishing
an Executive Action capability was the first time assassination
was ever raised with me in any context other than as a subject
of general philosophical discussion.
37. The memos of January 11, 1961 and of November 2, 1960 do not
make it any easier for me to date my original conversation with
Richard Bissell about Executive Action. The ZRRIFLE cryptonym
could have been assigned before or after my initial talk with
Bissell, so the date of that assignment would not be dispositive
of this question. I don't remember whether ZRRIFLE was a
Staff D. cryptonym or not.
ZRRIFLE/ARNOLD SILVER
38.
I do not know in what connection Richard Bissell
raised the subject of assassinations or assassination capability
with Arnold Silver prior to my initial discussion of the subject
with Bissell. My best recollection is that in my discussion
with Bissell, Bissell said that he had a general discussion of
assassination with Silver in the course of which Silver volunteered
that a Corsican asset of his might be useful in this connection.
But Arnold Silver had not previously used QJWIN as an assassina-
tion capability or even viewed him as such. Arnold Silver would
NW 50955 DocId: 32203892 Page 11
4
-10-
have had to clear any such use of QJWIN with me, and he did
not. When Richard Bissell spoke to Arnold Silver about de-
veloping an assassination capability, Silver must have raised
QJWIN as a possible asset.
39. I reviewed the typewritten version of Arnold Silver's notes
headed "Project ZRRIFLE" which were included in the QJWIN/ZRRIFLE
file. On page 2 of those notes, the following sentence appears:
The spotting activity has now advanced far
enough to justify removing from the OOA category.
"00A" refers to "Other Operational Activities," which is a general
fund that a CIA officer maintains to pay for development of
assets, including recruitment of assets, and general support
of agent operations.
40. The QJWIN file was created first in regard to WIN's recruitment
by Silver and then in regard to WIN's activities in the Congo.
Subsequently, it was transferred to the ZRRIFLE file. ZRRIFLE
was primarily set up as a project to obtain code and cipher
materials. I distinctly told Arnold Silver that QJWIN was
never to be told about the development of an assassination
capability. As far as I know, QJWIN never knew that the
development of an assassination capability was one of the
purposes of the asset spotting to which he was assigned.
41. I approved the asset spotting trip that QJWIN took through
southern Europe in 1961.

SIDNEY COTTLIEB/ZRRIFLE AND CONGO
42.
I believe, as I testified earlier, that my discussion of
assassination with Sidney Gottlieb was a general, philosophical
conversation precipated by Cottlieb's request shortly after he
became Chief of TSD This is substantiated by the following
fragments from my notes of my conversation with Cottlieb on
January 25, 1961, all of which refer to general TSD subjects:
"Framework of Sid's job"; "ELINT/RD memo" (referring to the
question of TSD's responsibility for research and development
on FELINT);
Ledfor
an ELINT officer never cut in on the
subject of assassination or on general Staff D operations to
Mobtain code and cipher materials); "translating machine."
The note on
ote on "anesthesia" refers to a problem that we experimented
with a good dealth, injecting harmless anesthetic gas into a pullman,
car for the purpose of relieving diplomatic couriers of cipher
material Note. This is This is a highly sensitive project, which
has not received any publicity)
وقت
43.
I talked to Sidney Gottlieb frequently in the course of my
work. However, I do not recall any other talk with Cottlieb
that more specifically concerned assassination than this one.
44. I knew that TSD had a poisoning capability in other words,
that they possessed lethal drugs. I very probably discussed
with Gottlieb the poisons that were available. But I do not
recall any specific conversation with Gottlieb on this subject.
NW 50955 DocId:32203892 Page 13
-12-
45. As far as I know, Richard Bissell had discussed assassination
capability with Sidney Gottlieb. I. would assume that this
talk with Gottlieb would have involved the manner and means of
assassinations. I have no knowledge that Sidney Gottlieb and
Richard Bissell ever discussed any specific assassination
missions.
46.
I do not think that I ever discussed QJWIN's trip to the Congo
with Sidney Gottlieb
Gottlieb never mentioned to me that he
had been to the Congo.
TESTIMONY OF TED SHACKLEY CONCERNING A "THREE MAN DECISION-MAKING
GROUP
47. Mr. Baron represented to me that Ted Shackley testified that I
had informed him in the early days of his tenure at JMWAVE
Station in Miami that there was "a three man group" making
decisions on Cuban operations. There was no such formal
decision-making group. I probably mentioned the three people
referred to by Shackley Lansdale, Helms, and Robert Kennedy
as three key people in the Special Group at that time.
HANK MANFREDI/BUREAU OF NARCOTICS
48. Hank Manfredi, was once used to go to Rome to spot assets. He
was la Bureau of Narcoticswagent at the time, so his participation
with the CIA was an extremely sensitive matter.
