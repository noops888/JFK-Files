MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Central Cover Staff/HOC
ATTENTION
:
Dan Shea
SUBJECT
: Request for Cover for AS36-1
1. Preliminary discussions on cover requirements
for AS36-1 have been held between WH/SA/CI representatives
and Mr. Shea and Mr. Bozan of the Central Cover Staff.
The proposed nonofficial cover, "Association for North and
Latin-American Interests, 80 Box 6334, Main Post Office,
Chicago, Illinois, will be very satisfactory. The following
cover information is keyed to the memorandum entitled
"Nonofficial Cover for Individual".
A. General Information on the Agent
(1) The cryptonym of the agent to
be covered is AS36-1. He has had no
previous pseudonyms or aliases.
(2) AS36-1 has been engaged under
a "Superintendent of Oral Commitment". He
receives a salary of $300.00 per month,
plus a furnished apartment as his residence,
which can also be used as a safehouse
or training site.
(3) AS36-1 has a FBI file in process,
submitted on 1 May 1964, and will be used as an
agent in support of WH/SA/CI operations,
particularly the recruitment or defection
of Cuban intelligence personnel and diplomats.
No dependents of AS36-1 are knowledgeable
of his CIA or U.S. Government connections.
(4) AS36-1 has not been examined by
the Agency's Medical Division to determine
his fitness for overseas duty. He will be
subject to examination at the first available
opportunity.
(5) AS36-1 is scheduled for an
LCFLUTTER test on 9 May 1964. He will be
given a psychological assessment at the
first available opportunity.
(6) AS36-1 has not been under control
of CIA or the U.S. Government previously.
To date, a cover story has not been required
because AS36-1 is under strict supervision
of WH/SA/CI and is not exposed to persons
other than Agency personnel.
(7) AS36-1 is available to assume a
cover status at present.
(8) AS36-1 is currently in Washington,
D.C., on a TOT stand-by basis and will use
the nonofficial cover provided in the United
States and abroad.
(9) Funds are available for this
activity, and are chargeable to account
number 4132-5455-5201. There is no conventional
form of project for this activity.
B. Biographic Information
(1) AS36-1 was born on 6 February 1937
in Havana, Cuba. He is a white male, married,
and is in the U.S. on indefinite parole to
the Agency. His last address was Calle O y
A, Havana, Cuba and is currently living in
a WH/SA/CI safehouse, in the Washington, D.C. area.
(2) AS36-1 has no dependents who are to

time.

unknown.
(5) AS36-1's hobbies and outside
interests are not known at this time,
except he enjoys baseball.
(6) AS36-1 is stable and dedicated
from initial impressions. No TBD/BAB

upon his Agency salary. He has no
financial resources other than $1870 pesos
left with his wife in Cuba.
(8) AS36-1 has traveled to Mexico,
Canada, and possibly Honduras. He has
not been known to reside in any foreign
country other than in transit.
(9) AS36-1 speaks Spanish only.
He has no other language faculty.
C. Security Considerations
(1) AS36-1 began his Agency service
on an oral contract basis on 1 May 1964.
A request for a POM for contract and
agency was submitted on 1 May 1964. No
derogatory information has been developed
by investigation.
(2) AS36-1 is aware of U.S.
Government interest in him. He is not
aware of CIA interest at this time.
(3) AS36-1 has not entered any Agency
installations.
(4) AS36-1 is in contact with no
one other than CIA staff personnel. His
family, relatives, friends are not aware
of his Agency connection, nor are they
aware of the area of assignment.
(5) AS36-1's past connection
with the Cuban Intel Service is known
to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and
the FBI.
(6) AS36-1 has no family problems
or any other problems which might have
a bearing on his ability to live his
cover, other than the fact that he speaks
only Spanish which could present problems
in English-speaking areas.
(7) AS36-1 has not needed any
reference to CIA for any purpose.
(8) Present plans for AS36-1's
utilization do not contemplate use of
any other nonofficial or official cover.
(9) AS36-1 is under direct supervision
of WH/SA/CI officers and no emergency contact
plan has been necessary to date. However,
a plan will be set up at a later date and
appropriate offices notified, as prescribed
by Agency Regulation 20-653.
(10) AS36-1 does not participate in
any Government or Agency-affiliated beneficial
(insurance) plans.
(11) AS36-1 is a Cuban refugee and
thus has no U.S. Selective Service status.
D. Operational Information
(1) WH/SA/CI has engaged AS36-1 to
support development of counterintelligence
operations. In Washington, D.C., he is used
as a source of information. When appropriate
recruitment targets are spotted abroad, AS36-1
will be sent abroad to support recruitment
operations. It is not anticipated that
any individual, in the U.S. or abroad,
will be made aware of AS36-1's CIA or
U.S. Government affiliations until he
is under or using his nonofficial cover
other than CIA staff personnel.
(2) AS36-1 is residing in Washington,
D.C. The only alternate location for
his residence would be in a nearby city
in the Washington metropolitan area.
(3) AS36-1 may be considered for
travel to any country in the free world.
This travel will be determined by WH/SA
and not by AS36-1. When he is abroad,
his travel will be controlled so that no
influences or circumstances will arise
which may cause him to travel to an undesirable
country.
(4) At present, there is no need for
AS36-1 to contact any social, cultural,
or political groups for cover or operational
purposes.
(5) AS36-1's current income
($300.00 per month plus a furnished
apartment) from CIA is reasonably compatible
with his proposed cover.
(6) AS36-1 is currently devoting his
full time to operational tasks assigned by
WH/SA/CI.
(7) A WH/SA communication channel is
needed in the handling of AS36-1.
(8) inasmuch as AS36-1 will reside in
the Washington, D.C., area indefinitely and
is unable to speak a language other than
Spanish, the proposed cover of "Association
for North and Latin American Interests",
a Chicago organization of which AS36-1 will
be a local representative, is considered
by the operating division to be most
satisfactory at present.
