:
ing information on the activities of selected individuals
and groups in response to Station and Headquarters neods.
Principal targets have been official installations,
Soviet 13 officers, Polish and Yugoslav official instal-
lations, selected Cubans, American Communists in Mexico,
Mexican leftists and exile groups in Nexico. Project
used an average of 15 lines per month with a high of 25
lines in October 1962. Primary emphasis is on CI/CE
information and data required to support other operations.
Project has continued to provide valuable information on
active Soviet intelligence officers and on other targets.
Of particular interest was the heavy coverage on Juan
Jose AREVALO. Project continues to be available as a
reserve for the liaison telephone tap operation, LIENVOY,
in the event of a change in attitude of the Mexican
Government. In addition to CI/CE and operational data,
project was credited with 36 positive disseminations.

COMMENTS:
SECRET
PI, CI and Contral Cover Staffs concur in renewal.
PI STAFF: Value of the project is primarily as
an operational support mechanism. Last year
provided 36 disseminations. Although relatively
expensive, it appears to be worth the cost in
view of its ability to perform a variety of useful
functions.
CI STAPP: Considers project as being an extremely
valuable producer of CI/CE coverage, leads and
support to other Station operations. CI Staff
appreciates the security problems as described and
feels that the Station has done a fine job in being
alert to and coping with these problems.
