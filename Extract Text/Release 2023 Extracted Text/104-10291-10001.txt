Deputy Director for Administration
:
: F. W. M. Janney
Director of Personnel
: Mr. Joseph Burkholder Smith
1. (U) Action Requested: None; this memorandum is in response
to your request of 15 May 1978 to provide you with a very brief rundown
on Mr. Joseph Burkholder Smith.
2. (C) Mr. Smith was born in 1921, holds B.A. and M.A. degrees in
History and has studied at the Ph.D. level in this field. He served
as a Corporal in the U.S. Army (1943-46) and from 1946-51 he was an
Assistant Professor of History at Dickinson College. He entered on duty
with the Agency in September 1951 as a GS-09 and reached the GS-14 level
before his retirement in June 1973. At the time of his retirement, he
was assigned to the DIXO/Western Hemisphere Division. He received the
Career Intelligence Medal. Overseas assignments included Singapore
1954-56; Manila 1958-60; Buenos Aires 1962-66; and his last assignment,
Mexico City 1969-73.
3. (S) Apparently after retirement, he wrote a book, Portrait of
a Cold Warrior, which he did not submit for security review or for DCI
approval. His book was already printed in advance uncorrected proofs
when the Agency first learned of its publication. It contained classified
information; however, the Office of General Counsel advised us that it was
the final decision of this Agency and the Department of Justice that we
would not pursue civil action against Mr. Smith. In this sort of action
you mist prove damages. The Operations Directorate was reluctant for
security and sensitivity reasons to point up those areas wherein we
had been damaged.
4. (U) In the event you wish to read further on this subject,
we have attached papers furnished us by Mr. John Greaney of the Office of
General Counsel.

which has not only drought them cary, Jealousy, and di-

But it was an Impression that was understandable, if erro-

Since the cars were gorprament property, the grand ol-

the Foreign Service Officers lato frearies of envy.
"We'll Entertain Ourselves"
E
VEN WORSE, perhaps, than using perquisites to fend
off the pangs of status anntety is CLA people's tendency
to huddle together. If the rest of the world thought we were
nondescript Army officers and the like, well, we know who
was and wasn't who and could play the game with each
other. The other.embassy personnes won't invite us to their
parties? We're too low on the diplomatic list to get invited to
the Important functions given by other embassies and by of-
ficials of the local government! Well entertain ourselves.
Conscient dentious CLA officers try hard to curb this practice,
which after all is a breach of nearly every tenet of good se-
curity, but they fall more often than they succeed.
In the days when our national purpose was more clearty
delmed, when we would, la the words of John F. Kennedy,
pay any price and bear any burden la defense of the free
world, it dida't matter so much if the cover of CIA person-
nel was a little thin la some countries, the prestige of tho
agency was even higher than i was at home, enormously
higher than it has been at home for the last three years. In
the Philippines in the late 1900n, the CLA was so well regar-
ded that members of the Army Counter Intelligence Corps
used to try to recruit Filipinos by passing themselves oft as
CIA agents. Today, the open life style of a station chief can
lead to his death as it did for Richard Welch in Athens.
Welch was killed by the gun of an anth-American assisain,
bot the gua was put into the rain's band by ail the defen-
ses against the dilerama of covert life that I'ra described
Welch lived in a house inherited from past station chiefs,
everyone in in the embassy knew his true position, and his
blography appeared in the Blographic Register, which could
be found ta any library.
Alee Welch died the rockster was crevetinlly castfied
but that doesn't mean an end to the problem CIA personnel
will always fed a strain from having to pretend to be nach
Jess succenter than they really are cren if they love their
work and believe in it deeply, they'll still feet pangs That's
human nature, and wille wo ought to curb the obviousness
of CIA agent identides, to some extent we're just got to
deal with it
On way to do that is to treat CIA agents sympathetically.
Those are obviously people w who have sacrificed somethin
to work for the agency, and who depend to to an Imordinate
extent on hastay stable relationships with their co workers
since they can't have stable relationship with anyone else.
The main thing is an agents life - practically the caly
thing, for many how he's treated at Langley, where de
stands there.
