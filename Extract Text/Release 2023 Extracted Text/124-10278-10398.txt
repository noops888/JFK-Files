Previous information has indicated that the
captioned anti-Castro organization is planning to carry out
a bombing raid over Cuba from Bimini in the Bahama Islands.
The airplane scheduled to be used in the raid is located
at the Broward International Airport, Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
(JFK)
On December 18, 1963, our source in this matter
who has furnished reliable information in the past advised
that a practice flight in the Aero Commander airplane,
number N2624B, located at the above-mentioned airport and
scheduled to be used on the raid, was to be made on December 19,
1963, and that a final practice flight was scheduled to be made
on December 20, 1963. No practice flight will be made over
Bimini as Charles Bush, the owner of the airplane, is opposed
to it for security reasons.
Orlando Bosch Avila, head of the captioned organization,
plans to have a quantity of propaganda leaflets dropped from
the airplane during the raid over Cuba. Bosch and his
associates have described a boat to be used in this operation
as being 28 feet long with a bridge on top. With reference to
this boat, our source has learned that William Johnson, a
United States citizen, pilot and businessman who was involved
in arranging for the airplane to be used on this raid, is
also involved in arranging for the use of the above-mentioned
boat.
