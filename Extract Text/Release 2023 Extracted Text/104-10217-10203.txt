2023 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
SECRET
MEMORANDUM FOR: Director
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Attention: Mr. B. J. Papich
FROM
: Deputy Director (Plans)
SUBJECT
: Richard Themes GIBSON
: 1953
1. An official Swiss source has provided the following information
on Subject:
201-20605. Richard Themes GIBSON, a U. S. citizen, born 13 May 1931 in
Los Angeles, occupation: Journalist and translator, arrived in
Lausanne, Switzerland from Algiers in late April 1963 and he has
resided there ever since. GIBSON, who holds U. S. passport
B-131994 issued in Washington on 25 January 1961, is married to
Jay Marjorie GIBSON, nee KAYE, a journalist and British subject
who holds British passport C 156546.
b. Subject came to the attention of the official Swiss source
recently through his association with Fredy Gilbert File ANDERSSON.
ANDERSSON, a Swedish citizen born 14 February 1933 in Lausanne,
editor-publisher of "La Cite" and editor-secretary of "Societe
cooperative CLAKER EDITIONS" has offices at 10-11 Metropole,
Lausanne. ANDERSSON has been known to have had for the past
ten years numerous contacts in international leftist circles of
all shades, including FLN Algerians, Congolese, Angolese, other
African politicians, Spanish emigres, French "refractaires anti-
colonialistes", etc.
c. Despite all the aforementioned contacts, ANDERSSON cannot be
definitely labeled as a communist and is viewed with some reserve
by the Swiss Communist Party (PCA) prominency. More recently
ANDERSSON came to special notice for his close contacts with
the Chinese embassy in Switzerland, particularly with LAO Hain,
the Attache. In April 1963 it was learned that ANDERSSON
published a luxury-edition of a brochure, entitled "Leninisme et
Revolutionnaires Modernes" on Chinese orders. This brochure raised
many unfavorable reactions in PCA circles. Three thousand copies
of this brochure are reported to have been shipped to China.

4. When Vice-President LO Cham of the Committee for Cultural
Relations with Foreign Countries stayed in Switzerland in April
1963, he reportedly met ANDERSSON and placed more orders for
ANDERSSON to publish Chinese Communist brochures supporting the
Chinese line in the present Sino-Soviet ideological controversy.
5. ANDERSSON is the distributor for Switzerland of the monthly
review "Revolution Africaine" which is published in Paris. Richard
GIBSON and his wife are employed by ANDERSSON (i.e., for the Paris
publishing firm) and they are responsible for translation, proof-
reading, etc., of the English-language edition of "African Revolution"
which is printed in Lausanne.
6. The official Swiss source has no previous record of the GIBSONs
nor any adverse information to date. They have requested information on
them. Permission is requested to pass the following summary on Subject,
taken from reports of your Bureau, to the official Swiss source (refer-
ence is made to your file on Richard GIBSON, No. 105-93072 and specifically
to the reports on him dated 5 October 1961, 24 January 1962, 27 August
1962, 17 September 1962, 24 September 1962, and 20 May 1963):
a. Richard Themes Gibson, American Negro journalist, born 13 May 1931
in Los Angeles, California, was active in the New York chapter of the
Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC) from the time of its organization
in the spring of 1960 until his departure for Algeria in the fall of
1962. The FPCC has been supported by the Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
and Gibson has buried himself as well with other front groups in the
United States supported by the SWP. (The Socialist Workers Party has
been designated by the Attorney General of the United States pursuant
to Executive Order 10450.)
b. Gibson apparently began to lose interest in the FPCC, partly
because of inadequate pay and operating funds, by the spring of
1962 when he stated that he intended to leave the organization in
the fall. Gibson left Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, in September 1962
for Algeria where he planned to work as a journalist for several
South American and European newspapers (none identified) and to
travel to Morocco, Ghana, Guinea and Mali before returning to the
United States. Eventually, both Gibson and his wife were given
posts with Revolution Africaine, a journal reportedly financed by
the Algerian Government.
c. Gibson's English wife, Sarah, was identified with the "English
Bureau of Revolution Africaine as of February 1963. Prior to his
departure from the United States Gibson served as Executive Secretary

of the Liberation Committee for Africa as well as serving as acting
Executive Secretary of the FPCC. The Liberation Committee for
Africa is an organization which is nationwide with the aim of help-
ing "African freedom fighters" and promoting awareness of a common
heritage for Afro-Americans and Africans.
