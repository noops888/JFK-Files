As desired by General Taylor on 12 March, the planning for Opera-
tion Mongoose is now prepared on a format of separate planning for each
Department and Agency involved. Revised planning along this line is
submitted herewith.
Activities already approved are marked with an asterisk. Further
planning must await determination of policy questions raised in my

PHASE I (CIA)
ACTIVITY
INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS
1. * Dispatch one intelligence
agent operation to key area
selected by CIA.
115 March 1962
PURPOSE
Collect and report intelligence on anti-
regime attitudes, on potential resist-
ance, and on vulnerabilities and
strengths of Communist security
system.
$1+3 2.13
third-country intelligence
staff officers in place in
Havana. (C)

CONSIDERATIONS
There is a risk that this action will disclose this U.S.
intelligence activity within Cuba. Selected personnel
are being intensively trained. This first team has 2
agents. An area in which resistance has been reported
has been selected. Agent operations must stay alive,
make useful contacts, and report securely to CIA.
Physical risk to personnel is substantial, due to lack
of intelligence. First reports from first team are
expected by the end of March, while reports from the
second and third teams, dispatched in March, are ex-
pected to start in April.
Many of the agents infiltrated into Cuba will be trained
for paramilitary skills as well as intelligence collection,
with the thought that they will be in place inside Cuba
and ready to act whenever paramilitary operations are
decided upon. However, CIA has noted that, once the
agents are inside Cuba, they cannot be controlled
effectively from outside Cuba, although every effort
will be made to attempt such control.
These staff intelligence officers may also be used in the
future for communications or agent handling, if future
developments warrant.

OTHER OPERATIONS
6. Continue negotiating for
British help in contaminating
locomotive lubricants. (C)
To collect intelligence required for the
operations, to identify and earmark in-
telligence assets as refugees arrive,
and to provide security against Com-
munist agent operations.
To up-date NIE 85-62, so that current
estimates can be considered at national
policy levels.
This operation, in response to early recommendati on
as essential by the Chief of Operations, is moving at
utmost speed to become fully active by 15 March, with
a new building completed and occupied, and with a
staff of 43 at work. Operations commenced 15 February
and, as of 9 March, 33 people were active at the Center.
(CIA responsibility, with support by Defense, Justice,
State, USIA.)
As the operations develop, there will be both increased
intelligence collection and a need for as current an In-
telligence Estimate as the U.S. can produce meaningfully.
It is likely that a more informal method of producing an
Intelligence Estimate for use at the national level (than
now governing the issuance of NIE's) may have to be
followed. CIA is now publishing daily intelligence sum-
maries on Cuba and is planning a bi-monthly or weekly
report summing up intelligence for this purpose. (CIA
responsibility, with support of others as required.)
To cripple Cuba's rail transportation. (c) British assistance is required to undertake a successful
sabotage of Cuban locomotives, through contaminating
lubricants. It is expected that a minimum of 3 months
is required before locomotives in Cuba start breaking
down, once the contaminant is introduced. (c)

patched to Cuba.

PURPOSE
To collect intelligence.
To ready agent operations.
To exploit the intelligence possi-
bilities of former residents of
Cuba (including U.S. citizens) now
in the United States.
To collect intelligence in a Latin
atmosphere, at different levels thar.
now seem possible in the continental
U.S., to spot additional intelligence
assets and to provide security
against Communist agent operations.
CONSIDERATIONS
Possible future use in communications and support.
Effectiveness and numbers are dependent upon purpose
of recruitment, nature of training, and policy decisions
controlling these factors. If the recruitment and train-
ing are for resistance activities, the task of recruit-
ment and training will be much less difficult than if
they are limited to intelligence-collection purposes
only.
There are "colonies" in Washington, D. C., and other
U. S. cities which are "little Cubas." Family, Church,
and business interests provoke unusual personal ties
inside Cuba for some of these residents; a real potential
exists for collection of intelligence not otherwise avail-
able. (FBI support and coordination is basic in this
effort.)
As Opa-Locka becomes fully activated, CIA will activate
other interrogation centers as promptly as feasible A
center is being activated in Spain Negotiations with
local authorities are being undertaken to activate centers,
if possible in Mexico City, Caracas, and Aruball San
Juan, Puerto Rico Vand Santiago, Chile, are being sur-
veyed for possible centers. (CIA responsibility with sup-
port by others as necessary.)

operations to penetrate the
regime.
To provide documentary and photo
graphic evidence of the tyranny of
the Communist regime.
To provide current intelligence on
key security resources of the
regime.
To provide current intelligence on the
actions and intentions of the regime.
Number of agents in each team and selection of areas
will be determined by developments of the previous
actions and by conditions.
Numbers, areas, and supplies are completely dependent
upon conditions at the time, and upon policy approval of
methods to be used (that is, if air delivery can be used,
or if this activity must depend upon maritime delivery).
This evidence will be used by CIA and USIA to neutralize
the influence of Castro and the Communists in the West-
ern Hemisphere.
This is conceived of as ground surveys, and the possible
recruitment of military and other official personnel as
intelligence agents.
This requires attempts to place trained agents inside
government organizations, or to defect officials "in place."

To provide the Special Group (NCC 5412

The intelligence estimate will provide a vital basis for

U.S. should undertake actions to make maximum use
of Cuban resources as a justification for decisive U. S.
military intervention.
