1. Reference is made to the telephone request dated 24
February 1961, of Major Malone for information concerning
Lindsey LING and Heinz Theodor HEINER. The files contain
the following information concerning the subjects of your
request.
2. According to information from an official Portuguese
service, LING was contacted in late August 1950 in Santana,
the Azores, by Eloy GUIFRETEZ Panoyo, a Cuban national, and
Lafa/probably a Cuban diplomat. In 1958
and 1959, LING was reliably reported, by other sources,
to have been a military supporter of Fidel CASTRO's revolution
and to be employed by CASTRO possibly as a G-2 agent. In
August 1959 he had infiltrated the ranks of certain anti-CASTRO
conspirators and delivered the leaders up to the Cuban Govern-
ment.
3. The Portuguese service further reported in September 1960
that Lindsey LING, aka LING Lind, was the manager of a Chinese
restaurant located at rua Valverde 9, Madrid, Spain, and that the
restaurant was owned by a second (unidentified) Chinese, who was
also supplying clothing to the United States personnel at the
Lajes Base in the Azores. Theodor Heinz HEINER, who had represented
the clothing firm in the Azores, was reportedly arrested there in
December 1959 on a suspicion of espionage, and was, as of September
1960, reportedly in Beraunda, where LING was planning to go to
investigate setting up another restaurant.
The files contain no further information concerning the
subjects than that which is already believed to be contained in your
files.
