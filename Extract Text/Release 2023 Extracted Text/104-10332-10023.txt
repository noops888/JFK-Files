Re: JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992
Dear Mr. Tunheim:
This will respond to your 14 September 1998 letter regarding
Central Intelligence Agency compliance with the "JFK Act."
I have no doubt whatsoever that the CIA has fully met its
obligations to locate, review, and release "assassination
records" as defined in the JFK Act. The Agency's 2 September
1998 Declaration of Compliance-signed, as you note, by CIA's
Director of Information Management, Edmund Cohen-confirms my
judgment. I have full confidence in the scope of the Agency's
searches as described in Mr. Cohen's recent declaration.
As Director of Information Management, Mr. Cohen is directly
responsible for CIA's records systems and for ensuring the
adequacy of CIA's search, review, and release of documents under
the JFK Act. Mr. Cohen signed the Agency's Declaration of
Compliance because he was the most senior Agency official with
direct personal knowledge that its statements were accurate and
complete. There was no more appropriate signatory.
In sum, I understand that the appropriate CIA staff officers
have worked diligently to locate and disclose to the JFK Board
all relevant records in the Agency's possession and that they do
not believe any other relevant records are being withheld from
the Board. Mr. Cohen's declaration confirms my understanding.
I trust that this will meet your requirements.
Sincerely,
George J. Tenet

as prohibited by law or Agency regulation or policy.
3. The purpose of this declaration is to provide an
assurance that the Central Intelligence Agency: (1) has made
a diligent records search to locate and disclose to the JFK
Assassination Records Review Board (the Board) all records
in its possession relating to Lee Harvey Oswald and the
assassination of President Kennedy; and (2) is aware of no
other assassination-related records in its possession being
withheld from the Board. I make these and the following
statements (including those in the attachments by reference)
based upon my personal knowledge, information made available
to me in my official capacity, the advice of CIA's Office of
General Counsel, and the conclusions I reached in accordance

Memorandum for the Record:
This is to confirm that I replaced the first page of the ExDir's signed JFK Declaration, dated 23
September, with letterhead stationery to assure that the statement was comparable to that signed
by Mr. Cohen, as earlier requested by the Board Chairman. The wording of the declaration was
unchanged; only the letterhead stationery was changed. I called Michelle in the EXDIR's Officer to
confirm that the Executive Director would have no problem with such a change (simply replacing
the first page). She called back, saying that she had asked Mr. Carey, and he had no problem with
this change.
Mr. Harrelson of this office will be hand carrying the EXDIR's declaration to the Board today. At the
same time, and in accordance with my agreement with Chairman Tunheim of yesterday, Mr.
Harrelson will be retrieving the earlier declaration signed by Mr. Cohen, the DCI letter of 16
September, both of which are being withdrawn. The Judge Tunheim also agreed yesterday that
since the EXDIR had agreed to sign the declaration that there will no longer be a need for the critical
language in their report on this issue.

Attachment I
Universe and Scope of CIA Documents
Addressed Related to the JFK Assassination
Summary. This Attachment discusses CIA material
examined in order to fulfill the requirements of the JFK
Assassinations Records Collection Act of 1992 (JFK Act).
It
addresses the types of CIA documents found in the records of
earlier investigations, including that of the House Select
Committee on Assassinations, and materials and files
recovered in response to searches conducted in 1992 and
thereafter. It discusses the process by which documents
became "assassination-related records."
Discussion. The Central Intelligence Agency has
provided large numbers of documents and materials over the
years in support of successive reviews and investigations
related to the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
We estimate that the equivalent of roughly 320,000 pages
comprise the "CIA collection" of documents associated with
prior assassination reviews, including duplicates. In
addition, we estimate that in responses to the JFK Act, CIA
has reviewed over 100,000 pages of documents from the
National Archives, the Ford, Johnson, and Kennedy
Presidential Libraries and miscellaneous papers from the
National Security Council, the President's Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB), the Rockefeller
Commission on CIA Activities Within the United States, and
the Senate Select (Church) Committee to Study Governmental
Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities.
The documentation exists in many forms, from original
contemporaneous material, such as field reporting from
overseas or analytic reports, to material generated
specifically as an Agency response to investigation
questions. The largest "CIA collection," as such, is
associated with the records of the House Select Committee on
Assassinations (HSCA). The HSCA brought together in one
place in 1978 the principal documents retrieved over the
course of years from earlier investigations, including the
Warren Commission, the Rockefeller Commission, and the
Church Committee.
The Warren Commission in 1963 and 1964 was the first
major review of the JFK Assassination. Existing records
suggest that CIA provided roughly 4,000 pages of
documentation to the Warren Commission review, plus
testimony by Richard Helms and John McCone. The Warren
Commission pursued matters related primarily to events and
actions directly associated with the assassination event,
including materials from CIA's Mexico City Station, which
were considered relevant because of a visit to Mexico City
by Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before the assassination.
The Rockefeller Commission in 1975 and Church Committee
investigation in 1975 and 1976 were focused on allegations
of wrongdoing by the CIA. Nonetheless, as a part of these
investigations they yielded information which, to many,
appeared to relate in some way to the assassination, such as
an operational capability or willingness to consider
assassination as an intelligence method.
From 1976 through 1979 the House Select Committee on
Assassinations (HSCA) pursued additional leads, generating
still further documentation. The HSCA ultimately brought
together within its broad scope of investigation many of the
documents from the Warren Commission, the Rockefeller
Commission and the Church Committee. This collection
ultimately became the "HSCA sequestered collection,” which
altogether contains an equivalent of over 300,000 pages, in
paper, photographs, tapes, and microfilm media, including
duplicates. Because the myriad conspiracy theories included
possible Soviet, Cuban, Mafia or right-wing American
involvement, the scope of the HSCA investigation included
anything or anyone that might appear to support those
theories, including historical institutional behavior
patterns. Further, although this sequestered collection was
considered to be CIA's, it contains documents from other
agencies, primarily the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) and over 30,000 pages of HSCA originated material.
1 The HSCA sequestered collection reflects the major corpus of CIA material or
information reviewed by the House Select Committee on Assassinations (or to
which they had access) during the 1976-1979 time frame. The pulling together
of this collection was coordinated by the Committee and they defined what it was
to include. This Collection has been physically held by CIA since 1979,
although CIA was not authorized access until 1992, when permission was given by
Congress to review the material in preparation for responding to the JFK Act.
2
The HSCA sequestered collection is contained in 64
boxes of multimedia material, including paper, photographs,
and microfilm which have been loosely organized into major
categories of information. Boxes 1 through 34 are mostly
material collected by the CIA's Directorate of Operations,
the FBI, and other Government agencies, including field
reporting and handwritten notes. They also include
newspaper articles, name traces performed in response to
requests by the HSCA staff, and copies of other documents
such as the CIA Inspector General's 1967 report on CIA plots
against Castro and Richard Helms' executive session
testimony before the HSCA.
Boxes 35 through 63 of this collection are largely
records of CIA's Legislative Counsel, Inspector General,
General Counsel, Office of Security, and Directorate of
Science and Technology, as well as internal records of the
HSCA staff.
They consist of reports, memoranda,
transcripts, cables, letters, newspaper clippings,
photographs, and charts. Box 64 contains 72 reels of
microfilm-the equivalent of roughly 72 more boxes of paper
documents. This material includes the file which the
Directorate of Operations maintained on Lee Harvey Oswald
(the 201 file) as well as similar files on additional
individuals. Many of the microfilm documents duplicate
other documents in the other boxes.
While not a part of the sequestered collection, a
separate "Oswald 201 File" has served as a CIA repository
for JFK assassination-related material over the years and to
a large extent material in this file is duplicative of
material in the sequestered collection. Only a few
documents were in the file at the time of the assassination.
The bulk of the approximately 26,000 pages currently in this
file consists of documents collected immediately after the
assassination and during the Warren Commission
investigation. Included are a large number of third agency
documents, primarily from the FBI. Other major additions to
the Oswald 201 file include relevant Mexico City Station
files and material generated by various FOIA requests and
investigations, such as that of New Orleans District
Attorney, James Garrison.
}
Assassination-related materials beyond the sequestered
collection and the Oswald 201 file which have been located
since 1992 generally fall into three categories. First,
there are new documents which have been generated since
1978, such as defector reports that mention rumors or
perceptions of conspiracies or newspaper or other open
3
source materials related to an individual associated with
the assassination. Second, in a number of cases targeted
areas of inquiry or more precise definitions of areas of
interest by the JFK Board have yielded more information and
added documents to the collection. And third, improved
search techniques have provided better access to those files
which are searchable electronically. Nonetheless, the
material located since 1992 is quite small when compared to
the material in the sequestered collection and the overall
set of material from CIA which has been designated as
"assassination records" by the JFK Board.
In accordance with the law, the Board has the authority
to designate records which it considers relevant to the
assassination as "Assassination Records." These documents
are then subject to review for declassification or, as
deemed appropriate by the Board, held for declassification
in the year 2017. The Board has designated the entire
sequestered collection as Assassination Records as well as
selected material generated in the course of searches
subsequent to 1992. The entire set of these documents is
the equivalent of roughly 320,000 pages, including
duplicates.

ATTACHMENT II.
Search Methodology and Types of Searches Conducted
1
Summary. This Attachment discusses the methodologies
used in conducting the searches, including what we know of
the searches which were conducted on behalf of the earlier
assassination investigations. It includes, in referenced
tabs, documentation of selected taskings. It discusses the
distributed nature of CIA's paper recordkeeping systems and
electronic databases and the custom keyword searches that
are used with electronic databases which CIA maintains.
Discussion.
The collection of CIA materials contained
in the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA)
"sequestered collection” has existed as a discrete body of
records since 1978. This material resulted from highly
labor intensive and systematic searches by individuals
familiar with the Agency's paper files and records systems
in use in the 1960s and 1970s. Today, the sequestered
collection comprises the great bulk of CIA-originated
documents which can be associated with the JFK Assassination
and related investigations.
For most of its history, the Agency has had a system of
records which has been shaped by the divergent requirements
of the directorates in accordance with the wide variance of
focus in their missions. These basic differences in the
missions of the directorates, as well as the compartmental-
ization-of-information procedures (the "need-to-know"
concept), have resulted in each directorate keeping its own
set of records in accordance with directorate-specific
guidelines. This applies equally to paper records as well
as to electronic databases.2
Since the late 1970s, the Agency has been in the
process of converting to electronic databases, which allow
for electronic searches for documents using keyword and
2
Even within a single database, information may--in accordance with information
compartmentalization requirements based on the need-to-know principle--be stored
in separate files by several offices or divisions, each with its distinct
recordkeeping criteria and access requirements. In order for a search to be
thorough, a search for one term or a combination of terms must be conducted
across all such files.
other indexing tools which provide much more expedited and
efficient searches. Because the most significant portion of
JFK assassination-related material was generated prior to
this conversion to electronic databases, searches of the
sequestered collection or other contemporaneous CIA records
have had to rely primarily upon labor intensive hand
searches.
Since 1992 and the passage of the JFK Act, CIA has, in
responding to the requests of the Board, had to devise
search methodologies and techniques to address both the hard
copy and electronic versions of our databases. With respect
to the hard copy material, Agency efforts have concentrated
on those component records most likely to yield
assassination-related documents. Short of a complete manual
review of all documents in the Agency, the techniques used
for searching hard copy materials include expert reviews of
file series and folder names, including associations with
known related topics, retrieving boxes of files from the
Agency's Archives and Records Center, and manually reviewing
those files identified as likely to contain the sought after
materials.
Electronic files searches can actually be more complex
than manual searches, in major part because of the number of
different electronic systems in use. The Directorate of
Operations' electronic databases, for instance, include most
cables since 1978 and they can be searched using single or
multiple search terms against the full text of these cables.
The Directorate of Intelligence's automated systems include
original source material used for analytic assessments as
well as the products themselves and can be searched through
a variety of electronic techniques. The DCI Area
(considered, for this purpose a directorate) maintains the
Executive Registry files which are not normally retrievable
through full text search, but by index searches. The
Directorate of Administration maintains a large and diverse
system of databases and files on employees and contractors
that includes data on security issues, medical records,
training, etc. The Directorate of Science and Technology
and its subordinate components maintain other electronic
databases unique to individual missions. Each of these
systems requires a unique set of access criteria and search
commands and must be searched by information management
experts of the respective directorates.
Where possible, automated systems were searched using
key words such as JFK, Kennedy, assassination, executive
action, Oswald, place names, and a large number of names,
crypts, or pseudonyms identifying individuals known to have
2
been associated with countries, key installations,
organizations, or operations that fell within the period
deemed relevant to the history of the assassination.
The following categories are examples of the guidelines
for relevancy with which both manual and computerized
searches were conducted. They include, but are not limited
to, individuals, organizations, places, projects, and
subjects which are considered central to the Oswald/JFK
assassination history and the ensuing investigations.

Prior to enactment of the JFK Act, in early 1992, the
Chief of the CIA History Staff, through various manual
searches of shelf lists, located the “sequestered
collection" of the House Select Committee on Assassinations
(sixty-four record center size boxes). After obtaining the
permission of the Congress, his staff surveyed these and
other related holdings on the assassination. In addition,
the History Staff located sixteen boxes of Lee Harvey
Oswald's 201 file and a number of loose folders, mainly from
Mexico City Station records that had been collected for the
Warren Commission.
In October 1993, following enactment of the JFK Act but
prior to the President's appointment of the Board, CIA'S
Historical Review Group (HRG) requested the directorates to
conduct a name search on Lee Harvey Oswald, JFK
assassination, and any related documents (Tab 1). This
request resulted in a series of meetings and discussions
with various Agency components and Information Release
Officers. More than thirty-one additional boxes of
materials were sent to HRG for review. Included in this
material were nineteen boxes of JFK working files of Mr.
Russ Holmes, a CIA employee who for many years was the
Agency's focal point officer with responsibility for
responding to questions related to our assassinated-related
records. Also included were two boxes on Nosenko, seven
boxes of Latin America Division documents, and three boxes
from the Bay of Pigs project. Out of these thirty-one
additional boxes provided to the Board staff, approximately
twenty-two boxes of material were designated by the Board as
assassination records. The preponderant volume of these
records is duplicative of documents in the sequestered
collection.
In April 1995, after the Agency received the Board's
first formal request, and in anticipation of "what are
4
likely to be many requests from the Board for information..."
the Agency Executive Director asked each directorate and the
DCI Administrative Officer to appoint a focal point officer
for the JFK Assassination review. (Tab 2)
In the spring and summer of 1997, the Agency arranged
for the Board staff to receive a series of briefings by
representatives of each directorate on the files kept within
the records systems of each directorate. These briefings
covered aspects of the records systems, such as how the
records are organized, maintained, searched and retrieved,
as well as how they had been previously searched for
assassination-related materials.
The Board staff requested a number of additional
searches, which have now been completed. These requests
were both formal and informal and resulted in responses to
the Board staff which included a wide range of additional
material, some of which was judged relevant to the history
of the assassination. This material includes the histories
of various CIA operations and Agency components, files on
specific individuals involved in either the Warren
Commission or in HSCA investigations, and the results of CIA
internal reviews of programs and operations. Although many
requests from the Board and responses from the Agency were
handled informally, the significant initial requests are
listed in the table in Attachment V.
Prompted in part by the surfacing of a small number of
new relevant documents, the Board staff requested CIA in the
summer of 1998 to: (a) perform an additional set of searches
on certain specific topics; and (b) issue an Agency-wide
notice reminding CIA employees of the requirements of the
JFK Act.
Specially tailored tasking was sent to the three
Directorate of Operations components deemed most likely to
possess records relevant to the JFK assassination of the
kind of concern to the Board (See Tab 3). Among other
considerations, this special tasking included a list of new
or revised search terms, a request for clarification on the
disposition of the James Angleton files, and the requirement
to focus on potential new information from the debriefing of
defectors in which any reference to Oswald or to the Kennedy
assassination occurs.
DCI Tenet issued an Agency-wide Employees Bulletin on
22 July 1998 directing all CIA personnel to "consider
documents in their possession or with which they are
5
familiar that might have relevance to the Board's review..."
(ΕΒ ΟΙΜ 98-02-See Tab 4).
Finally, and in a separate tasking, all directorates
were asked to assure that searches undertaken were
sufficient to enable a directorate representative to provide
a certification of compliance with the JFK Act, and that the
DCI's Bulletin had been forwarded to all directorate
employees. (See Tab 5).

Appointment of Directorate Focal Points
for JFK Assassination Board Requests
1. I would like each of you to appoint a focal point
officer for your Directorate who would be responsible for
responding to requests for information from the (President
Kennedy) Assassination Records Review Board. (AIUO)
2. The Agency has received the first (attached) of what
are likely to be many requests from the Board for information
related to the assassination of President Kennedy and to the
investigations into the assassination. Up to now, the Board
has focused on the "sequestered" records CIA had collected
for the House Assassination Committee's investigation and
documents that had been part of the Oswald 201 file. It is
expected that the new requests will require records searches
to be done for additional information. (AIUO)
:
3. The Historical Review Group (HRG) of the Center for
the Study of Intelligence (CSI), which has been the Agency's
principal liaison with the JFK Board, will continue in that
role. HRG will receive requests from the Board, and then
forward them to the Directorate focal points for action.
Responses from the Directorates will be coordinated by HRG,
which will make the responses available to the Board. (AIVO)
4. Please provide the name of your focal point officer to
John Pereira, Chief, HRG (x30373-secure) by 13 April. (AIUO)

SUBJECT:
(U) New Search of CI Files for JFK
Assassination Records
REFERENCE:
(AIUO) Bulletin OIM EB No. 02-98,
dated 22 July 1998
1. (ប) The JFK Board has made a number of recent
specific directed requests to assure that the Agency has
complied fully with the requirements of the JFK Act. Among
these was a request for issuance of the Reference Employee
Bulletin, in which the DCI directed that employees leave "no
stone unturned" in assuring that relevant documents are
provided to the Commission.
2. (U) In part because relevant new documents have
surfaced within the past few months, the Board has also
requested specific focus on renewed searches of the Agency's
"counterintelligence files." The new documents have
surfaced due to a variety of reasons, including references
to assassination related personalities in recent defector
reports, records made available because of the break up of
the Soviet Union, and advances in search capabilities due to
digitization of older paper files.
