Re: Civil Action No. 94-1909;
Keenan v. Dept. of Justice, et al.
Dear Kirsten:
The CIA has, through you, suggested that it might conduct
additional searches for records pertaining to my client, Mr.
Lawrence P. Kaenan, if Mr. Keenan furnished additional information
which enabled it to conduct such searches. Although Mr. Keenan be-
lieves that the information which he initially furnished the CIA
was sufficient to have located some records pertaining to him, he
is providing the following additional information in hopes that the
CIA will now be able to locate responsive records.
Mr. Keenan states that on or about June 1951, he completed a
series of CIA application forms for employment. At that time, be
resided in the 1600 block of Connecticut Avenue, N.W. Mr. Keenan
was encouraged to submit these applications by two CIA women em-
ployees who resided at the same location.
After Keenan completed these applications, he was interviewed
at length as a prospective CIA employee. At the conclusion of the
interviews, Keenan and the CIA officer who conducted the interview
were unable to reach agreement on a starting salary, as the CIA'
offer was too low for Keenan. Bagad on the CIA's interest in
Keenan as a prospective amployee, it is clear that at a minimum, it
should have a 201,file on Keenan.
For six years Keenan was an FBI Supervisor. For six and a
half years he was Foreign Assistance Inspector in Southeast Asia.
During these periods he had frequent contact with CIA representz-
tives in investigative matters of mutual interest. Because of
this, there should be numerous references to Keenan in CIA files..
As an FBI supervisor, Keenan played a role in the FBI's inves-
tigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. This
is evidenced by the following documents:

now carrying out the searches which should earlier have been made.
and should have located responsive documents.
Sincerely yours,
Minn veran
