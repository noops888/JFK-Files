SUBJECT: UNINTEL CKTOP JAGUAR/IVAN DMITRIYEVICH OBYEDKOV 1201-779495)
REF: LONDON 81224 IN 2003461 4
1. OBYEDKOV ACTED AS A GUARD AT THE SOVIET EMBASSY IN MEXICO
CITY, ALTHOUGH HE APPEARED TO BE BETTER EDUCATED THAN HIS DUTIES AS
A GUARD WOULD DEMAND. AMONG HIS MAIN DUTIES, HE TENDED THE SOVIET
EMBASSY TELEPHONE, STOOD GUARD DUTY AT THE GATE, TOOK MESSAGES FOR SEN
OTHER SOVIETS, NOTIFIED THEN OF MEETINGS, AND ARRANGED APPOINTMENTS.
HE ALSO OCCASIONALLY DROVE ONE OF THE EMBASSY CARS ON ERRANDS.
DURING HIS TEHRAN TOUR, HE WAS ALSO LISTED AS A GUARD AT THE SOVIET
EMBASSY. HE WAS OBSERVED TO BE VERY SECURITY CONSCIOUS. 4
2. ON BOTH PRECEDING TOURS OBYEDKOV APPEARED TO FUNCTION AS A
LEGITIMATE GUARD AND WAS NEVER OBSERVED IN THE ACT OF PERFORMING
ANY INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES.
BECAUSE A SOVIET IS LISTED AS A GUARD
AT A SOVIET EMBASSY, IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT HE IS NECESSARILY A
OFFICER. SINCE WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT AN
AFFILIATION WE WILL NO LONGER CARRY HIM AS SUSPECT

PCS Departure - Ivan Dmitriyevich OBYEDKOV
ACTION REQUIRED
1. For your information, we no longer carry Ivan Dmitriyevich OBVEDKOV
(201-779495), guard at the Soviet Embassy in Tehran, as PCS. He was not listed
on ROGWEN's April 1971 Presence List nor their December 1971 list. We assume
he has departed PCS.
3. The following are comments made
on 8 July 1970:
OBYEDKOV
He is very security conscious, especially in dealing with "official people" or
superiors. He mentions his name to his friends freely, but refuses to say his name
when he knows that one of the superiors is calling, "this is the duty officer" OBYEDKOV
would say several times. He often lectures people when they violate security regulations
when talking on the telephone. OBYEDKOV has to be persuaded several times or even

begged if someone needs help (getting a vehicle or when asking for a favor), but when
he decides to help, OBYEDKOV will say with the problem until he gets results.
Although OBYEDKOVA seeras to be more cultured and better educated than her
husband, it is certain that only OBYEDKOV makes the final decisions. OBYEDKOV
could be very pleasant, helpful and even kind, but it usually depended on his mood.
5. The only Soviet we noted as being friendly with OBYEDKOV during his tour
(201-808524),

When speaking to one another they used the familiar "ty".

1. Reference A reported the departure of Subject from Mexico on 4 August
1965. The Station now believes that Subject departed PCS, and that he has possibly
been replaced by Ivan Petrovich KARCHIN, whose arrival on 14 August 1965 was
reported in Reference B.
2. According to LIENVOY,
has been answering the telephone at the
Soviet Embassy, a duty for which Subject was previously responsible. According
to LICALLA,
has also been taking guard duty at the entrance gate to the
Soviet Embassy, which Subject also had as one of his duties.
3. In addition, LIENVOY reported that on 17 August 1965 that "a new school
director" had arrived at the Soviet Embassy. OBYEDKOVA had previously been the
director of the Soviet school in Mexico, and the fact that she had been replaced
indicates that she will not return to Mexico. The identity of the new school
director has not been established, although it may be

10. PERSONALITY, CHARACTER, HABITS:
Although Subject acted as a guard at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico, he
appeared to be fairly well educated and was not subservient to any of
the other Soviets, with the exception of Counselor Boris Aleksandrovich
KAZANTSEV (201-028975). On one occasion Subject was reported to te
helping the daughter of Commercial Counselor Georgiy Stepanovich VISKO
with her arithmetic homework. On another, Subject was asked about methods
of producing metal wire, a subject on which Subject was well informed as
a result of his having once worked for a wire factory (1).
Subject had a tape recorder at home which he likedto listen to. He also
occasionally went fishing with other Soviets (1).
Subject told "Boris" /paragraph 7c above/ in Moscow to build a large
garage, because he was bringing a big car back with him. He also asked
whether "Boris" had bought a refrigerator and TV for the apartment. On
another occasion he was negotiating for a can of paint to take back to
Moscow with him to repaint "the Moskvich." Subject and his wife were
both buying watches just before leaving Mexico. (1). / From the above it
appears that Subject was fairly well-off financially, for a guard/.
11. CURRICULUM VITAE:
(date unknown)
28 August 1962
Subject reportedly had worked at the Serp i Molot
wire factory in Leningrad (1).

On 17 August 1963 Subject stated that he had just returned from a trip
with Valentin Vasilyevich BAKULIN (231-261813) (1). /BAKULIN is an identified
GRU officer. The Station has no further information on the nature of this
trip, nor any reports of other trips taken by Subject./
From 6 to 19 November 1962 Subject was in the hospital (Sanitorio
Reforma) in Mexico City. On 11 November he underwent a three-hour operation of
an unspecified nature. The other Soviets had to take guard duty with him in the
hospital, and it was stressed that one of the Soviet men should be with him after
he came out of the operation. (1).
15. CONTACTS:
Subject is not known to have had any contact with non-Soviets during his
tour in Mexico, with the exception of an occasional visit to one of the doctors

MICROFILMS
1. Headquarters agrees that Subject is probably not identical with
Ivan Ivanovich OBYEDKOV (201-121531) as was earlier believed, and has
accordingly assigned ivan imitriyevich 201-779495. A full Headquarters
trace under that name ttrrned up no information other than that originating
from Mexico City Station, which has now been re-classified into the new
file. We are puzzled by the fact that MEXI-1850, dated 1 September 1962, the
first piece of correspondence from Mexico City Station on Subject, reported
him as Ivan Ivanovich.
2. A photo comparison of the two individuals in this case is not
satisfactory proof that they am in fact two people because of the difference
in years and exposure in the photographs. The pre-Mexico City traces on
Ivan Ivanovich reflect only a date and place of birth as identifying data.
It is hoped that Mexico City Station can obtain soon identifying biographic
