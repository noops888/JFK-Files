It is noted that the enclosed CIA memorandum mentions
contact on the part of LEE OSWALD only with the Soviet Embassy
and no mention was made of the Cuban Embassy. Although the CIA
memorandum was dated 10/16/63, the blockstamp of this office
indicates it was actually received here on 10/18/63. On the
same date our cable #109 captioned "LEE OSWALD, IS - R," was
sent to the Bureau. This cable furnished a summary of the
information contained in the CIA memorandum and requested the
Bureau to furnish background data to this office. Bureau cable
#743 dated 10/22/63 and bearing the same caption furnished such
background and advised that additional background was being
furnished by mail. This additional background information was
received at the Mexico City Office on 10/28/63.

Assassination of President Kennedy--Reported
Anonymous Telephone Message

Tren
1. The following cable from the CIA Station in London was reported
orally to Mr. Samuel Papich at 0930 on 23 November:
2. The British Security Service (MI-5) has reported that at
1805 GMT on 22 November an anonymous telephone call was made in
Cambridge, England, to the senior reporter of the Cambridge News. The
caller said only that the Cambridge News reporter should call the
American Embassy in London for some big news and then hung up.
3. After the word of the President's death was received the re-
porter informed the Cambridge police of the anonymous call and the
police informed MI-5. The important point is that the call was made,
according to MI-5 calculations, about 25 minutes before the President
was shot. The Cambridge reporter had never received a call of this
kind before and MI-5 state that he is known to them as a sound and loyal
person with no security record.
4. MI-5 noted that similar anonymous phone calls of a strangely
coincidental nature have been received by persons in the U. K. over the
past year, particularly in connection with the case of Dr. Ward.
5. The British Security Service stated its desire to assist in
every possible way on any follow-up investigations required within
the United Kingdom.

`1. Reference is made to your memorandum of August 14,
1964, Subject as above, your file number (S) 105-82555, in
which you requested that seven enclosed photographs be
shown to VIADUCT and certain questions be asked of him.
2. VIADUCT was interviewed on 9 September 1964 with
the following results.
3.
Photograph no. 1:
(1) Nikolay SERGEYEV Source did not recognize the
face and had never heard the name.
(2) Annette (Anita) SETYAEVA, nee ZUGOFF, formerly
known as Annette GOLDSHTEYN (GOLDSTEIN) and
Annette Henkina (KHENKINA): Source recognized
her immediately by face, giving the name Annette
KHENKINA, formerly Annette GOLDSHTEYN. He
could not recall her maiden name but when offered
the name ZUGOFF he said this would be correct
as it is an Ossettian name and her father had
been Ossettian and her mother a Canadian. Source's
additional information on this woman is provided
in paragraph 8 below.
(3) Joseph ADAMOV: Source recognized his photograph
immediately and provided the name correctly,
identifying him as his long-time friend, previously
discussed in the British report referenced in
your memorandum.

(4) Annabelle BUCAR: Source recognized her photo-
graph immediately and gave her name correctly.
She is the person discussed in the British
report.
(5) Sergei RUDIN: Source recognized his photograph
immediately and gave his name as "RUDIK"Aand
RUDERMAN or RUDIMAN, the same man referred to in
the British report. Source said he is a close
friend of Joe ADAMOV's. He is Jewish and was
originally from New York, but is now a Soviet
citizen, married to a Russian woman and father
of three or four children. He works in the
English languago section of Radio Moscow. He
had formerly had a very small flat of one or
two rooms, with which he was very unhappy, but
Radio Moscow got him an attractive and larger
flat in a building on Peschanaya Street.
(6) Lucy (Olga) PRAVDINA: Source recognized her
photograph at once as the woman who had given
him English lessons in 1944 or 1945 when he was
briefly employed at Radio Moscow) He believed
her name was Irina or something like that, and
she had previously spent possibly ten of fiftoon
years in the United States with her husband who
had been a TASS man there. Source could not
recall her last name (married name) but thought
it began with a "K". When Source first met her
she was a program director for Radio Moscow and
did some announcing. He said she spoke excellent
English, was a good worker and well liked by her
colleagues. He did not know the names LUCY and
OLGA PRAVDINA, and was certain neither was her
actual name.
Photographs 2 and 3: Source recognized these as
Annette KHENKINA, of paragraph 3 (2) above.
5. Photograph no. 4: Source recognized number 1 as
the person identified in paragraph 3 (6) above; and recognized
Annette KHENKINA, Sergei RUDIMAN, and Joe ADAMOV. He did
not recognize Nikolai SERGEYEV in this photograph.
6. Photograph no. 5: Source recognized all persons
in this photo, as identified in paragraphs 3 (3), (2), (4),
and (5) above.
SEGRET
NW 50953 DocId:32319429 Page 5
7. Photograph no. 6: Source recognized number (1)
as KHENKIN (first name not recalled), the second husband
of Annette GOLDSHTEYN KHENKINA, and number (2) as Annette
herself. He knew that they had a son and assumed that the
child in this photo was that son, but he had never seen the
child. Source provided the same information on KHENKIN
previously included in MI-5 Report Number 279 referred to
in your memorandum. He added to this that The apartment
building in the background of photograph number (3) is
the location of the apartment which KHENKIN was given after
he had written a letter to STALIN complaining of quarters
he was first given when he repatriated to the Soviet Union
in 1945 or 1946.
8. Photograph no. 7: Source recognized Annette
KHENKINA, but did not know any of the others in the photo.
When number (4), Marina, was pointed out to him, he stated
that she was the right age to be Annette's daughter by her
first husband, GOLDSHTEYN. Source had seen her as a small
child, possibly about five or six years or age, in 1945.
He has never seen her since, knew nothing more about her,
and could not identify her photograph.
Source commented
that he had never met GOLDSHTEYN, Annette's first huðband,
but knew that he was much older than she and he speculated
that the older man in this photograph might be Boris
GOLDSHTEYN. Source gave the following additional information
on Boris GOLDSHTEYN: He was some kind of engineer-technician,
not employed by Radio Moscow. He did not approve of Annette's
working in the radio field, and disapproved of the people
she worked with there and the general atmosphere of work.
Annette was already separated or divorced from GOLDSHTEYN
when Source first met her, sometime in 1944 or 1945. While
Annette was still married to GOLDSHTEYN, she had an affair
with Joe ADAMOV.
9. Regarding Lev or Leo SETYAEV, Source had never
heard the name. He was not aware that Annette KHENKINA
had married for the third time, although he knew that she
was divorced from KHENKIN and that he was interested in
marrying a woman who was an editor in a publishing house.
10. Source had never heard of Lee Harvey OSWALD
prior to his defection, and had no information regarding
his participation in a Radio Moscow interview in late
1959. He commented, however, that it was not unusual to

a low-level KGB agent who defected to the British in 9/63-is
presently in the U. S. under CIA control. His bonafides have
not been established and he is suspected to be a plant. CIA,
according to Papich, plans to extensively interview him in an
effort to reach a conclusion as to his bonafides. He was a
witer and was associated with Radio Moscow in the late 1950s and
(U) MI-5 Roport Humbar 27-sets forth considerable information con-
Cerning individuals associated with Radio Moscow, some of whom
he suspects to be in the service of the KGB. From personal papers
of Oswald, it is believed he engaged in a breadcast over Radio
