SUBJECT
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Dr. Martin Luther KING, Jr.
1. Reference is made to this Agency's out message
number 94270 dated 25 April 1968 concerning the assassi-
nation of Dr. Martin Luther KING, Jr..
1--
2. On 16 April Roderick Claflin BROWN, a Panamanian
national born 1 July 1917 in British Honduras, voluntarily
appeared at the Department of National Investigations (DENI)
of the Republic of Panama and signed a deposition, the
highlights of which are as follows:
(1) On 26 October 1962 he served as cook/seaman,
aboard the Texaco S.S. Southhampton which docked at Mobile,
Alabama.
(2) While on a shore visit to the Mobile airport
on the morning of 26 October 1962 in the company of two
fellow Panamanian seasen, he was approached by Marvin P.
LITTRELL, owner of LITTRELL Motor Co., 921-25 South Clinton
Street, Athens, Alabama, who after ascertaining BROWN was
a Panamanian seaman, asked if he knew of Dr. Martin Luther
KING, Jr.
(3) LITTRELL inquired whether BROWN was interested
in employment, the details of which were unspecified. He
went on to describe Dr. KING as "Our greatest problem who
16 causing us much trouble." He gave BROWN a business card
to use in the event he was interested in pursuing the employ-
ment offer.
(4) On 28 January 1963 BROWN wrote LITTRELL from
New York City, stating he was interested in a job and
SEURET
ここ

L
-3-
requested $75 for travel from New York City to Mobile.
On 2 February 1963 BROWN received a reply from LITTRELL,
restating that he had a job waiting for BROWN in Alabam,
but questioning why $75 was needed since the fare was less
than $40 by bus.
(5) After discussions with a relative and friends
in New York City, BROWN suspected that the LITTRELL job
offer was related with assassination plans for Dr. KING.
Therefore he did not respond to the LITTRELL letter and
dismissed the incident until the death of Dr. KING in
April 1968. BROWN returned to Panama in 1964.
3. Enclosed for your information is a copy of the
LITTRELL letter and the Spanish language deposition made
by BROWN, as well as an English translation of the deposition
as described in paragraph 2 of the referenced out message.

SUBJECT Communist Comments on the Death of Martin Luther King/
Reference to "Black Power" Concept
ACTION REQUIRED: REFERENCES
1. Attached for Headquarters retention are one copy each
of statements on the death of Martin Luther King by the Dominican.
Communist Party (PCD), the Communist 14th of June Revolutionary
Movement (MR-1J4), and various trade unions. All appeared..
in the 7 April 1968 issue of El Nacional.
2. The text of the PCD statement makes reference to the
visit of Stokely Carmichael to the Latin American Solidarity
Organization Conference (LASO), quotes a statement by Fidel
Castro on Carmichael and the concept of "Black Power," and
expresses the solidarity of the PCD with the struggle of
North American Negroes. The MR-1J4 statement, only available
in gist, says that King's death reveals the profound crisis
existing within US society and shows that for the "racist
forces, "violence is the only law and is applied to internal
and external enemies alike.
3. Neither statement issues a call to violence on the
part of US Negroes.
