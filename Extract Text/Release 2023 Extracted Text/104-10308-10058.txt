A. SABOTAGE OF CUBAN SHIPPING IS BUT ONE OF MANY
EFFORTS TO CRIPPLE CUBAN ECONOMY, SIMPLE DELAY OF SINGLE SHIP
CAN COST UP TO 1000 DOLLARS PER DAY. SERIOUS DAMAGE SHIPS OR
CARGOES OF COURSE EVEN MORE COSTLY, WHILE NO SINGLE ACTION WILL
SERIOUSLY WEAKEN CUBAN ECONOMY, TOTAL EFFECT OF AGRESSIVE PROGRAM
COULD CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY.
