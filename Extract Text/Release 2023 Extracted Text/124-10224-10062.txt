NOTE:
Subject, former French Army officer who deserted and who
is now reported to be militant member of Secret Army Organization
(French terrorist group), is of interest to French authorities. This
stems from fact that French have received information that subject
was in U.S. in late 1963 and left for Mexico coupled with fact that
President DeGaulle plans to visit Mexico in mid-March. We are
conducting inquiries re subject as police cooperation matter.
