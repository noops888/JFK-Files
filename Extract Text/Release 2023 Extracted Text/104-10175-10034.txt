Remico. After Vining e
Corde, which is one of his accounts in Rico. Aft
the stelart explanation of Agency interest, Wichtrich stated th
ha chouflake cazething clear, c., that he worked for the Agency
Mexico. De calified this statement by explaining that his
ccnsive background and experience in Mexico cabled hin to set up
Listing places, "front" offices and other "cover" projects for CIA,
I and State Department. Although he was quite candid there was no
con to dost that he was telling the truth.
2. Wichtrich felt that these agencies were doing a cool job in
Cheerving and reporting the Mexicca situation and therefore då zot
el that they had overlooked anything in not asking him for his on
cinions and cheervations. This raises the question as to whether he
is a "legitimate contact for our exploitation. Ee talked fre
Gout the political cituation cal appears to be as knowledge as
cryone we could expect to fird. He mentioned, however, that anything
wich he reported might be duplication. Nevertheless, come of his
vers are very interesting. De not only feels that Padilla Servo
(his executive secretary, Dugena de Anzoroma), Carrillo Flores,
د, Contceros and Carlenes are pro-Communist but that there are
Caite indicaticas of a growing trend toward the left by the viole
remst. Comples of this in his opinion are Ruiz's priced
vents, cuch as rocic, about which nothing has been done cal
He reecat devaluation of the peso. These create insecurity,
Hiity and confusion in the veil inom pattern of Commist influence

Abon Corailio, a bandit leader who was formerly associated with
Cariques, has successfully defied all attempts by the police to
castrol his activitics throughout the states of Mexico ani orelos.

cbility to stage a successful revolution is doubtful, Wichtrich
