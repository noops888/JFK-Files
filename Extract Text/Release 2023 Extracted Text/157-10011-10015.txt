Subsequent to HARVEY's arrival in Miami, the pills were given to VIRONA through ROSSELLI. (49)
"VARONA requested arms and equipment needed for the support of his end of the operation.
ROSSELLI passed the request to HARVEY. HARVEY, with the help of TED SHACKLEY, the chief
of the JMWAVE Station, procured explosives, detonators, 20.30 caliber rifles, 20.45 caliber
handguns, 2 radios, and boat radar." (49) HARVEY omitted items which could only be
obtained from the U.S. Government because the provision of such items would destroy ROSSELLI'S
cover as a representative of private business. "HARVEY says that SHACKLEY never knew to whom
delivery was made nor for what purpose." (50)
The arms and equipment was loaded by HARVEY and SHACKLEY into a U-Haul truck and passed
to ROSSELLI in the parking lot of a drive-in restaurant (119-50). "The keys were then given
to ROSSELLI for delivery either to MACEO, to VARONA, or to VERONA's son-in-law." (50) (Cont.)

DR. EDWARD GUNN, Chief, Operations Division, Office of
Medical Services, has a notation that on 16 August 1960,
he received a box of Cuban cigars to be treated with a
lethal material. (21). He understood them to be CASTRO'S
favorite brand. (21). GUNN's notes show that within the
next month he contacted Ray Treichler, of TSD, (Sept. 6,
1960) and gave him the box-of-cigars (21). Treichler
recalls "that he did contaminate a full box of 50 cigars
with Botulinum Toxin, a virulent poison," (21) which would
kill the intended victim upon merely putting it in the
mouth. Treichler's notes showed delivery of the box on
February 13, 1961, although they do not indicate to whom.

WAINWRIGHT met with TEPEDINO, who reported to him AMLASH's reaction to his meeting with
FITZGERALD. TEPEDINO said that AMLASH dwelt constantly on the fact that "he could not
understand why he was denied certain small pieces of equipment which promised a final
solution to the problem, while, on the other hand, the US Government gave much equipment
and money to exile groups for their ineffective excursions against Cuban coastal targets.
According to TEPEDINO (AMLASH) feels strongly on this point, and if he does not get
advice and materials from a U.S. Government technician, he become fed up
again, and we will lose whatever progress we have made to
