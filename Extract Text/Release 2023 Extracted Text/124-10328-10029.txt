Your attention is directed to your file 100-23450
captioned "Union Filos, IS - C." The report of SA
John B. Van Etten dated 5-3-51 at Washington, D. Co, in
that file reflects on page six that Richard Townsend
Patton was employed by Carl Marzani in 1947, the year
that Marzani was convicted and sentenced for denying
membership in the Communist Party. It is noted your relet
reflects Patton was subject of of an investigation by
your office in 1956 for possession of obscene films.
In view of derogatory information available regarding
Patton, the Bureau does not feel he is suitable material
for development as an informant and authority is
therefore denied your office to investigate him as a
PSI for the purpose of possibly developing him as a double
agent in this matter. Bureau is arranging for
interview of Isa Sabbagh by another Government agendy
and results will be furnished you. (S) (U)

It is also requested that the Bureau request the
concerning DAJANY. It is noted that PATTON
indicated that SABBAGH and DAJANY apparently had
a "falling out" after SABBAGH's wife left him.
PATTON believed the reason was that SABBAGH felt
that Mr. and Mrs. DAJANY took JOAN SABBAGH's side
and may have been instrumental in her decision
Sale Department of State to have ISA SABBAGH interviewed
to leave him. (0)

It is to be noted that these records reflected a
check dated 7-14-59, was made payable to the St. Moritz
Hotel of New York City in the amount of $29.28. It should
be noted too, that in records of the subject's new account
at the Union Trust Company there is a check dated 7-13-59,
made payable to the St. Moritz Hotel in the amount of fifty
dollars.)
In regard to the serial numbers of currency
being deposited by the subject at Riggs National Bank,
a number of serial numbers of subject's deposits have been
obtained and have been made a part of the instant file.
As of 6-30-59, however, this practice has been discontinued
Kinasmuch as New York has disclosed that payments to DAJANY C
were being made by bank money orders and in some cases from
the Israeli United Nations account. In the event a comparison
of currency is desired in the future, this procedure can be
accomplished from the information already in the file.
Bureau attention is directed to letter from
Office of Security, Department of State, dated 6-25-59,
attaching the report of Agent E. H. WIDDIFIELD of the
State Department, dated 6-13-59. It was indicated that a
photograph of DAJANY had been exhibited to DONALD L. SNOOK
of Tripoli (no date). SNOOK was said to positively have
identified the subject as being the person he had furnished
information on previously. In this regard, Office of
Security reports of WIDDIFIELD, dated 2-9-59, and 4-10-59,
set out information concerning OMAR AHMED DAJANY and UMAR
FAROUK DAJANI which were obviously not identical with the
subject of instant case. DAJANY has been continuously
residing in the U. S. since 1951. Although SNOOK identified
a photograph of subject, he did not specifically indicate
with whom subject was identical. It appears that he does
not know the subject and the information furnished by him

SECRET
For information of the Bureau, on 8-1-59, subject,
without prior contact by WFO, was approached at his apartment_
where he was requested to come to WFO for the purposes of
interview and gaining his assistance. Subject, who was in
his pajamas, felt the interview could be done at the BETON
apartment, however since Mrs. DAJANY was in the bedroom, OMAR
located just off the living room, subject was advised
that an interview did not appear to be possible under
such circumstances. Subject was reluctant to come to the
FAROUK
the Mis
for his trip on 8-5-59. He suggested a booth in the
Washington Circle Drug Store with which he was familiar
and arrangements were made for him to meet Agents there
in ten minutes. A portion of the interview was conducted
in complete privacy at the drugstore for approximately
thirty-five minutes and at which point it was made
obvious to the subject that he must look at photographs
of perscy he called MOURAD (ph) and person believed to
be DAVID ZUTA Thereafter, the interview was conducted
at WFO.

Subject indicated that he would keep is contact
with interviewing Agents in complete confidence and would
report promptly any further contacts made to him by persons
he believed to be intelligence operators. DAJANY's accounts
of his contacts with other than known Israeli intelligence C
operators were obviously true, however his account of
contacts with MOURAD MOURAD (MEDAN) and ZUTA were just as false
and fabricated. Re
Repeated emphasis on the obvious untruths
on his part merely brought more denials, It appears
subject is a pathological liar.
(ण
For the above reasons, WFO does not recommend
further contact with the subject for the purpose of
developing him as a double agent or a source of information.
