1. From LIONION coverage of LIRING a photograph of a person
believed to be Subject was obtained. This person visited LIRING on
26 June 1967. Due to the fact that LIONION-l was hospitalized for
an emergency operation of 27 June, the photographs did not become
available to the Station until 18 July.
2. A sterile copy of the photo was positively identified 20 July
1967 by the LNGOLD employee to whom LANDISON had applied for a
passport. Attached for Headquarters is a copy of this photo.
3. LNERGO has been supplied with a sterile copy of this photo
