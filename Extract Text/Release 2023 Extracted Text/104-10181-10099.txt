REF: DIRECTOR 233355
1. WE BELIEVE THAT CHANCE ENCOUNTER WITH AMAUTO-1
ALONE TOO DIFFICULT TO ARRANGE SINCE AMAUTO-1 IS
FREQUENTLY IN COMPANY SOMEONE FROM HIS STAFF OR HAVING
LUNCH WITH SPANISH OFFICIALS OR BUSINESSMENT. MOREOVER,
ENCOUNTER UNDER THIS SITUATION, WE FEEL, WOULD NOT PERMIT
RELAXED EXCHANGE BETWEEN SAMKO AND AMAUTO-I. WE WOULD
LIKE TO SUGGEST FOLLOWING ALTERNATIVE:
A.
ON ARRIVAL SPAIN VIA AERONAVES DE MEXICO
FLIGHT 450 LEAVING MIAMI FRIDAY SAMKO WOULD GO DIRECTLY
AN
AB
BX
DASHED
TO HOTEL OF STATION SELECTION. STATION OFFICER WILL ALSO WH/C/OF
OCCUPY HOTEL IN ALIAS AND INITIAL CONTACT WITH SAMKO WILL
BE MADE IN HOTEL. (INCIDENTALLY, BELIEVE NO NEED
PA CHANKIS ACCOMPANY SAMKO TO MADRID.)
B. EARLY SUNDAY AFTERNOON SAMKO WOULD GO DIRECTLY
TU AMAUTO-1'S PRIVATE RESIDENCE.
HIS EXCUSE WILL BE
THAT HE WOULD HAVE GONE TO EMBASSY BUT WAS CERTAIN THAT

THAT BECAUSE HE IS AMERICAN HE SHOULD NOT VISIT PBRUMEN

SUSPICION. SAM KO'S APPROACH TO AMAUTO-I RESIDENCE CAN
BE MONITORED FROM HOMES OF TWO STAFFERS WHO LIVE WITHIN
EYSHOT OF AMAUTO-I'S RESIDENCE.
C.
(IN 085476)
AMAUTO-I'S PROBABLE SECOND QUESTION: HOW DID
SAM KO KNOW HE WAS IN MADRID? REQUIRES MORE THOUGHT AND
HELP FROM MIAMI. IDEALLY, SAMKO SHOULD BE ABLE SAY THAT
A MUTUAL FRIEND OF BOTH AMAUTO-1 AND SAMKO WERE TOGETHER
RECENTLY IN MIAMI AND AMAUTO-I'S NAME MENTIONED. SAMKO
ASKED WHAT HAPPENED TO AMAUTO-1 AND FRIEND DISCLOSED THAT
AMAUTO-1 NOW
(SUBJECT WH/MIAMI 7595
MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE "FRIEND" WHOSE NAME SAMKO MIGHT
USE. STATION SUGGESTS THAT CONTACT BE MADE WITH SUBJECT
IN LOS ANGLELES TO DETERMINE WHETHER HE KNOWS WHERE
AMAUTO-I IS. ALSO OBTAIN PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION, OCCUPATION
IN LA AND PRIOR JOB IN MIAMI PLUS OTHER NOTABLE
CHARACTERISTICS WHICH COULD BE USED AS FILLER BY SAMKO
