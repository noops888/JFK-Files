Memorandum Branigan to Sullivan
Re: ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY
62-109060
DETAILS:
SECRET
L 1961-1962. XX
Mr. Merriman Smith, senior White House correspondent,
reported Garrison alleges David William Ferrie was associated
with a group of anti-Castro Cubans which trained at Lake
Pontchartrain, Louisiana, during the period 1961-1962. On
February 23, 1961, CIA confidentially informed this Bureau
that in connection with a sensitive CIA project directed
against Cuba, one phase of which involved the training of
Cuban exiles, CIA would initiate a training operation at
Camp Belle Chase, located a short distance south of New Orleans
and Lake Pontchartrain. CIA advised that this camp had been
a deactivated Naval base but would be reopened by CIA under a
Department of Army cover. CIA further advised it would be
training from 15 to 40 Cubans at a time for a period of about
five weeks. We, of course, did not i investigate CIA's activities
at Camp Belle Chase, Louisiana, and our files contain nos (U)
information that David William Ferrie had any connection with
this CIA operation.
In July, 1963, we received information from several
sources that a number of Cuban refugees had come to New Orleans
from Miami, Florida, through the efforts of Rudolph Davis,
reportedly to attend a training camp after which they would be
sent to a training camp in Guatemala. Sources reported this
group became disenchanted and returned to Miami shortly after
their arrival. U
He
We interviewed Rudolph Davis in this matter and he
indicated he acted as a coordinator between the Movimiento
Democratica Cristiano (MDC), an anti-Castro organization, and
the New York City Police Department in 1961 and that he was the
delegate for this anti-Castro organization in New Orleans.
stated he came to New Orleans in August, 1961, and in early
1963 made friends with persons in the lumber business in
Guatemala with whom he formed the Guatemalan Lumber and Mineral
Corporation. Davis said he brought approximately 19 men to
New Orleans to train for lumber cutting work in Guatemala. He
added that when the men learned they were to work in a lumber
industry and were not recruited for military operations against
Cuba, they became disenchanted and returned to Miami. Our
files contain no information indicating that David William
Ferrie or Lee Harvey Oswald had any contact or connection with
Davis or the anti-Castro organization which Davis represented. U
