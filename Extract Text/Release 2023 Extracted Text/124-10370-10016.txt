Re:
Ilona Marita Lorenz
The attached newspaper stories alleged that "Alex
Rorke, a wealthy adventurer who worked for both CIA and the
FBI" was involved with Frank Fiorini, a "CIA Agent," who recruited
:
the subject in an assassination plot against Castro.
Alexander I. Rorke is a former FBI clerical employee who, during
the time of the alleged plot in 1960, was a free lance
photographer. He had been temporarily detained by the Cuban
Government in 1959 and for many years was active in anti-Castro
activities in the Florida area. From time to time he contacted
the FBI and was dealt with at arms length because of his
adventurer, personality and self-serving motives. He disappeared
on a plane flight in 1963 to Central America. Frank Fiorini.
also known as Frank Anthony Sturgis was well known to the FBI
for his anti-Castro activities in the U. S. following his-
defection from Cuba in 1958. He was also one of the Watergate
break-in subjects.
Additional information in FBI files indicates that the
and (U)
subject also furnished information concerning the July 26th
Movement in the U. S. This group was the original political and
military organization which Castro used to overthrow the Batista
Regime in Cuba. The subject was also interviewed in 1962 in
Florida regarding a White Slavery Traffic Act (WSTA) case and
admitted being the mistress of Marcos Perez Jimenez, former
President of Venezuela, who fathered her daughter. Investigation
failed to establish the subject was a victim in the above mentioned
WSTA case. The subject is the present wife of NY 7511-IA who
furnishes information on Soviet and Soviet-bloc matters. She
is aware of her husbands cooperation with the New York Office and
has, on occasion, volunteered information of value. The subject
is presently separated from her husband and in April, 1976, the
New York Office opened a potential criminal informant file on her
because of her contacts with a New York area crime figure,
Guiseppe Faggiano, and a race horse trainer. She furnished
information regarding gambling, shylocking and bank robbery matters.
However, because of the recent publicity set out in the attached
newspaper clippings, the fact that she is planning to write a book
concerning her Cuban experiences and the fact that she terminated
her contact with criminal elements, her case was closed by the
New York Office.

RELEASE OF CIA INFORMATION
IN THIS DOCUMENT. JM 2/22/99
AS SANITIZED
On January 16, 1976, the captioned individual tele-
phonically contacted the Denver Office of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation and spoke with Assistant Special Agent gent in
Charge Simon Tullai. He referred to a letter dated January 13,
1976, from the Director of the FBI, Clarence M. Kelley, which
herreceived concerning Mr. Ely's Privacy Act request. Mr.
Ely appreciated the response of the FBI, but felt he was now
under surveillance by either the FBI or the CIA. He requested
a personal interview.
On January 22, 1976, Richard N. Ely was interviewed
in the Denver Office of the FBI by Special Agent Dale A. Berndt.
Mr. Ely advised he is investment advisor to D. H. Baldwin
Company, Colorado National Bank Building, Denver, Colorado
(Lucian Wilson, President). Mr. Ely lives in Lakewood, Colo-
rado, and maintains an office at Brooks Towers, Suite 37-K,
Denver, Colorado. He stated he is married and lives with his
wife.
Mr. Ely wished to explain his concern over being
surveilled and felt it was the work of the CIA. When asked
what would prompt such surveillance, he stated that previously
he had been self-employed in an auto safety device firm.
Having had difficulties with patent infringements on his
devices in Europe, he had occasion to travel to Sweden and
Switzerland. During 1961, Ely was in Sweden and as he was
having marital difficulties with his first wife, entered into
an affair with a Swedish citizen, Helena Johnson. Miss Johnson
was an agent for various art firms. At one point in their
affair, Johnson urged Ely to purchase a moose hunting license
and a Swedish war surplus rifle fitted with a Zeiss scope so
that he could bag a moose and sell it for about $700. Sensing
something was amiss, Ely returned the rifle to Johnson and
discontinued their liaison. While going with Miss Johnson he
learned she was a member of the Baltic League, a violently
anti-Russian organization. After their split, he learned she
was also a member of the Swedish intelligence services. He,
therefore, suspected he was being set up as a "patsy" for an

assassination attempt which would have taken place in Sweden
when Premier Khrushchev came there to speak to the Swedish
Reichstag, subsequent to the death of United Nations Secretary
General Dag Hammerskjold.
Additionally, Ely claimed to know the identity of
a man described in a recent book relating to the assassination
of President Kennedy, who was supposed to be a hired killer
for the CIA named "Saul." When Ely's Privacy Act requests of
the CIA failed to produce information to him, he sent a letter
to the CIA, United Statos Department of State, Department of
State Consular Service, and the Church Committee which indi-
cated he would tell all he knew of the CIA unless they revealed
to him all they have on record concerning him. This letter
seemed to result in the surveillances he suspects are directed
at him, and as a result he has consulted various lawyers, police
officials, and his employers for aid in determining what will
stop the suspected surveillances. He indicated his office has
been broken into and his mail has been tampered with.
Mr. Ely requested the Denver Division of the FBI
get in contact with the local office of the CIA to notify them
that he is willing to say nothing about the CIA to anyone if
they will cease their interests in him. He mentioned he had
received a personal letter from Senator Church of the Church
Committee assuring him his case would be heard subsequent to
the Committee's termination on February 21, 1976. Mr. Ely
advised he would furnish nothing to the Church Committee now
unless obliged to by it.
During the interview, Mr. Ely appeared calm, articulate,
educated, and sober. He indicated his IQ was in excess of 160
and he had graduated from three different colleges. He was well
dressed and business-like.
On January 23, 1976, Special Agent in Charge James
Sommerville, CIA, Denver, Colorado, advised his office has no
record identifiable with Mr. Ely.
