SUBJECT: Soviet Contacts with Americans in Denmark
1. Reference is made to your letter entitled David Allan BOOTH, dated
4 October 1960, your file number 100-432027, and to various memoranda from
this office concerning Soviet contacts with American students in Denmark.
Specific references among our reports to you are CSCI-3/758,793, dated
20 September 1960, and CSCI-3/761,974, dated 20 September 1960. The following
Additional information concerning the subject matter has been provided by an
official of a Danish security service.
2. BOOTH's contact with members of the Soviet Embassy in Copenhagen
first came to official attention when, on 13 October 1959, he was contacted
by Vladislav Mikhailovich ABARCHALIN, a clerk at the Soviet Embassy in Copen-
hagen, and made arrangements to meet ABARCHALIN and the latter's "two wives"
at a theater that evening. ABARCHALIN initiated this contact in a manner
frequently used by KOB officers in Copenhagen. They met at the theater as
planned, the party also including ABARCHALIN's wife and Yuriy Alekseyevich
IVANOV, born 30 March 1924 in Brianak, USSR, who was an Attache and suspected
KOB officer at the local Soviet Embassy. BOOTH, who had obtained tickets for
the entire group, arrived escorting an unidentified woman.
Another of ABARCHALIN's contacts in Copenhagen has been Rembert
Caven ALLEY, who is the subject of OSCI-3/761,974. on 29 October 1959
ABARCHAINEN ALLEY at the town hall square in Copenhagen and the two
went together to a restaurant and later to the theater. ABARCHALIN arranged
this meeting in the came manners as he used in contacting BOUTH, as mentioned
above. ALLEY has United States Passport No. 1570658, 1ssued 21 May 1959
in Chicago, and he has given his address as 304 W. Willow Street, Chicago 4,
Illinois. He has stated that he became interested in Denmark as a result of
having worked in the United States with a Danish architect. He received a
Bachelor of Architecture degree from the University of Clinois in February

1956, after which he entered military service. He was released after six
months as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army Signal Corps. In
his work in Denmark, for a firm doing military construction in Greenland,
ALLEY does not have access to classified documents, but he does have access
to unclassified blueprints and other papers and he is in contact with a
mumber of people working on the Greenland projects.
4. It appears that ALLEY was the individual through whom ABARCHALIN
came into contact with Marvin KANTOR, inasmuch as ALLEY indicated to ABAR-
CHALIN on 5 November 1959 that he would introduce him to KANTOR that evening.
It is believed that on that evening ALLEY and ABARCHALIN walked together to
KANTOR's address but failed to see him. According to official travel records,
KANTOR had left Denmark for the USSR on 25 May 1959. He returned on 10 Septem-
ber 1959, presumably having spent the intervening period in the Soviet Union.
5. On the evening of 16 November 1959, however, ABARCHALIN was observed
entering a local restaurant with ALLEY and KANTOR. The three sat down at a
table with two unidentified foreigners of oriental appearance. All members of
the group apparently knew each other, since they immediately entered into
rather animated conversation. They also looked at some papers or magazines,
one of which bore the title, Soviet Film. Later in the evening KANTOR left
the restaurant alone, carrying a newspaper or magazine, and ALLEY and ABAR-
CHALIN left together soon thereafter, ALLEY separating from ABARCHALIN after
a shori time and returning to his residence alone. The two oriental-looking
foreigners remained in the restaurant and later joined two other men who also
appeared to be foreigners. One of the latter two left the restaurant at about
0050 hours and drove off in a car registered to William VALENCIA, an education
student born on 9 March 1936 in Chicago. The other unidentified foreigner was
a Negro who left the restaurant at 0015 hours.
6. We will forward to you any additional information that may be received
concerning the matters reported above.
