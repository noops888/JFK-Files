Latin America Division Task Force Report
of Possible Cuban Complicity in the
John F. Kennedy Assassination
1. Attached is the Latin America Division report of
findings relative to Cuban complicity in the assassination
of former President John F. Kennedy. This research which was
conducted from mid-October 1976 to June 1977 at the direction
of the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, E. Henry Knoche,
reviewed all Agency operations conducted against Cuba from
1 January 1960 to 1 January 1965 (concentrating on the period
1 January 1960 to 22 November 1963). We found no definitive
proof that the Castro regime was implicated in the Kennedy
assassination.

SUBJECT:
Latin America Division/JFK Task Force How
Research was Conducted
1. The LA Division Task Force to investigate records
in connection with the assassination of President Kennedy
was formally organized in mid-October 1976. Its purpose,
basically, was to research all Agency operations conducted
against Cuba from 1 January 1960 to 1 January 1965
(concentrating on the period up to 22 November 1963) for
any evidence that such operations might have provoked the
Government of Cuba to take executive action against
President Kennedy. Researchers were also alert to activities
seemingly directed against the U.S./CIA.
2.
Reference to material for this research was obtained
from the LAD Registry, the Cuba Desk machine runs, and a
special comprehensive file listing prepared for this purpose
by ISS (Information Services Staff). It was originally
thought that material pertinent to the search would number
approximately 900 operational folders, plus related 201
dossiers. It was later determined, however, that a thorough
review should include additional operational and subject
files which brought the total to well over two thousand files.
In view of the date of the material, much of it, both operational

and subject `, has been retired to Archives at Warrenton,

at Headquarters. This material is easily retrievable
through the use of specific job numbers and file reference
numbers recorded and retained in the LAD/JFK Task Force
files (too numerous to cite herein.)

b. Criteria Used in the Research:
As a guide the research group followed some
33 Terms of Reference provided by the Deputy IG, which
were compiled on the basis of issues raised in Book V,

of the Senate Select Committee Final Report on the
Assassination.
(Book V, and a 23 May 1967
Memorandum for the Record by the Inspector General
on Plots to Assassinate Fidel Castro, were required
reading for the researchers.)
In addition to the
Terms of Reference, the group remained alert to other
items of interest brought to its attention by the IG
staff, on an ad hoc basis. A name trace was always
run, and/or 201 dossier, if available, reviewed, on
any individual allegedly involved in an assassination
plot against President Kennedy or Fidel Castro. This
task was made somewhat easier as the result of a
memorandum prepared by the Cuba Desk, in August 1975,
based on traces of the names in the Black Book that
Fidel Castro passed to George McGovern which dealt
with individuals allegedly involved in assassination
attempts against Castro.
c. Findings and Organization of the Findings:
Each researcher submitted a draft paper noting the
Subject of the folder (s) reviewed, a brief description of the
activity, and a copy of the document (s) (findings) which
contained information believed to be pertinent to the re-
view. Also included were Job numbers, Official File
numbers, inclusive dates of material researched, and
number of volumes reviewed. Beginning in January 1977, at
the request of the IG Staff, the researchers also began
noting FBI and/or other government agencies knowledge of
SECRET/SENSITIVE

information.
Separate, finished, memoranda were prepared,
on the basis of these data, including the heading Findings.
This heading lists the specific document number (s) and
other pertinent data, and a few lines providing the gist
of the document (s) for purpose of easy and quick
reference. These memoranda, with a copy of the document (s)
attached, are filed in alphabetical order, by project and
subject, in hard-back green folders as part of the official
LAD/JFK Task Force files under the official classification
number 019-604-001 (Volumes XI through XX). Also included
in the records are two folders (Volumes IX and X) con-
taining 1,439 draft memoranda with negative findings.

Anti-Castro Activities Cuba 19-9-9
HVCA 11020 dated 28 February 1964
A Caracas Station asset reported an operation called
"Plan Judas" being constructed at that time inside
Cuba. The plan reportedly involved an internal
uprising with the support of certain Cuban military
figures conspiring against Fidel CASTRO. Key figures
reportedly included Juan ALMEIDA, Efigenio AMEIJEIRAS
Delgado, Pepin NARANJO, Regino BOTTI, and two COSSIO
brothers. On 24 February 1964, Francisco SUAREZ
Quinones, a JURE (Revolutionary Junta) member in
Caracas, told U.S. Embassy officials that JURE was
then sponsoring a plan to assassinate Fidel CASTRO and
other high-ranking Cuban Government officials as part
of an operation designed to incite an internal rebellion
in Cuba. The Station reported this plan, speculating
that it may be connected in some way with Plan Judas.

Manolo AGUILAR, 829 S.W. 9th Avenue, Miami, leader
of the Frente Revolucionario Anticomunista (FRAC)
(Anti-Communist Revolutionary Front) obtained some

speculation in Miami and Washington that Attorney General
Robert Kennedy was quietly backing a new anti-Castro
operation with exiles Manuel ARTIME, Enrique RUIZ Williams,
and Roberto and Jose SAN ROMAN. A1l held high posts in
Brigade 2506 (Bay of Pigs). Speculation linked Kennedy's
close association with these exiles to a deal with
Nicaragua through ex-President Luis SOMOZA.

TDCSDB 3/651,885 dated 25 October 1962
Reported view of Soviet diplomat on the Cuban
situation. The Soviet diplomat, Minister MOLYAKOV,
told a Bloc diplomat that he thought the U.S. action
with regard to Cuba was "an election affair." He
professed to believe that Kennedy learned on an
election tour that his popularity had dropped and
undertook the Cuban measure to "become the leader
again," and gain mass support. Further, that it
worked, and Kennedy again had succeeded in being
the ''man of the nation." The Soviet diplomat commented
that the USSR would not let the American move go
without retaliation. /COMMENT: This no doubt referred
to the missile crisis.7
TDCSDB 3/652,011 dated 1 November 1962
Reported reaction of Satellite officials to the Cuban
missile developments. One remarked that Cuba was as
important to the USA as to the USSR and thus conflict
was inevitable. Some agreed that President Kennedy
had made a tactical error in not simply invading Cuba
without warning. An East European remarked that all the
European nations had shown understanding of "Kennedy and
his ships, and would let him play around with them until
the elections, but after the elections he would have to
put them away and negotiate seriously." The source
commented that it was clear that the officials had no clear
insight into Soviet intentions, or what the real

ramifications of Cuba would be, but were talking to
reinforce their faith.
GNVA 6117 (IN 00894) dated 18 January 1964
Report on Soviet Bloc officials' attitude towards U.S.
internal political developments. An East European
attributed the assassination of President Kennedy to
the Birch Society but stated that something must have
gone wrong at the last moment. He speculated that an
attack on the USSR was to have followed on the heels
of the assassination but had somehow been forestalled.
GNVA 4523 (IN 38202 ) dated 19 December 1962
Reported that Soviet offensive missiles were introduced
into Cuba as part of a twofold Soviet-Cuba plan which
was agreed upon "several months ago." Emplacement of
Soviet defensive missiles was to constitute the first
phase. For the second phase, a major Soviet fleet unit
was to have been invited to visit Cuba on a cruise. This
was expected to cause immediate U.S. reaction, but the
presence of Soviet fleet units surrounding Cuba was
considered an effective guarantee that the U.S. would
not resort to immediate invasion or other armed action to
eliminate missile threat. Purpose of exercise was to force
13-00000
SECRET/SENSITIVE
- 13 -
a major change of U.S. policy towards Cuba. It was
anticipated that U.S. reaction would be violent, and from
the beginning the plan called for immediate withdrawal
at the price of agreement by U.S. that it would end
hostile attitude towards Cuba. The Soviets did not
implement phase two. This disappointed and angered
the Cubans. The Cuban leaders considered that the
Soviets had besmirched its own honor and offended the pride
of Cuba. KHRUSHCHEV composed a letter to President
Kennedy proposing a deal concerning Soviet missile
bases in Cuba and American bases in Turkey. KHRUSHCHEV
reportedly later regretted the phraseology and not
having consulted with Cuba prior to dispatch of the
letter.
GNVA 6316 (IN 31199) dated 3 March 1964
Raul ROA said that prior to his assassination, President
Kennedy "established certain contacts" with Cuba. ROA
Kennedy had sent emissaries to contact Cubans.
specifically cited contacts that had taken place in
New York. ROA thought that Kennedy would have gone on
to negotiate with Cuba, for practical reasons, which
would have been to Cuba's advantage. He thought that
President Johnson was unaware of Kennedy's actions.

in April 1959 to elicit information from contacts in
Cuba. He was arrested in April 1961, released, and
returned to Miami in February 1962. He was used by
