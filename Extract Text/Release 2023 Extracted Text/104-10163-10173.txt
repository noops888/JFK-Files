MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation with AMBIDDY-1
DATE:
7 January 1965, 2130 Hours

1. AMBIDDY-1 reported that Manolin Hernandez arrived
from Central America and reported that Vico Starke and
Frank Marshall, with the support of General Anastacio Somoza
of Nicaragua, were planning a coup against President Francisco
Orlich in Costa Rica. A-l planned to depart Miami for Managua
at 0700 hours, 8 January on Lanica airline to check this infor-
mation with General Somoza and to attempt to ensure that his
equipment is not being used to carry out the coup. A-1 will
have his private communications pad and promised to send us a
message as soon as he talked with General Somoza and with the
Orlichs and Starke in Costa Rica.

2. A-1 agreed to try to return to New York on Saturday,
9 January, for a meeting with Mr. Archer (Chief, WH). A-1
will call as soon as he arrives in New York at which time
arrangements will be made to bring him to Washington for the
meeting.

3. A-1 reported he and Al Burt had signed a non-aggression
pact. A-l feels there is little to gain from his point of view
in continuing the squabble with Burt.

8 March 1965
MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Phase-out of ARTINE Autonomous Group

1. On the night of 5 March 1965, the case officer for
Manuel ARTINE Buesa met with him and outlined the policy
decision reached by the 303 Committee on 4 March. ARTINE
was told the decision was to terminate our operational
relationship in as friendly and cooperative manner as
possible, but not later than 1 May 1965. The case officer
had been empowered to convey this information and to con-
duct an exploratory discussion of the problems and possible
solutions connected with a phase-out program. The two
main points the United States Government was concerned
with were (a) fair but reasonable demobilisation support
to the personnel of the autonomous group, and (b) ARTINE's
assistance in insuring that the balance of power in Central
America was not upset, particularly by preventing the
weapons of his group from falling into the hands of
political extremists or free-booters.

2. ARTINE had been on notice for several months that
a phase-out might be ordered at any time, and had an inkling
that the decision had been made because his regular monthly
subsidy had not been received on schedule. He had obviously
given the matter considerable thought and made up his mind
as to his course of action when he arrived at the meeting.
He began the discussion by summarizing the things he might
have done had he been so inclined. Among the possibilities
mentioned, he included loading up his troops and weapons
and taking over Haiti as a base against Cuba, intervening
in Costa Rica to bring down the libera, PLN administration
in favor of a rightist junta of dissidents, or throwing in
completely with General Anastasio Somoza in Nicaragua. The
weapons, personnel and equipment of the autonomous group.
He has the capability of fielding an infantry battalion
reinforced with artillery (4.2 mortars), supported by an
and maritime elements, with a cadre of trained and combat-
experienced Cubans, provided he teams up with an organization
SECRET
14-00000
-2-
who can furnish about 1,000 men to flesh out the unit.
The case officer acknowledged that we recognized his potential
for harmful action, had considered it thoroughly, and hoped
he would not do anything of the kind. ARTINE said he had
also considered all the possibilities and concluded
there was no point in his being childish and trying to
"bite us about the ankles."

3. ARTINE accepts the decision and will cooperate
in a phase-out program. He does not understand the
rationale, and, of course, does not agree with the
decision, but he acknowledges our prerogative to make it.
If we really wish still to be friends, he is willing,
just as he told Mr. FitzGerald originally. He asks only
that we help him make it possible to remain friendly and
makes two requests from us: (a) help take care of his men
and their families until they can rehabilitate and
resettle themselves, and (b) do everything possible to
get his parents out of Cuba.

4. The major elements to be considered in a phase-
out were discussed with the following results:

a. Personnel. The first priority is support
payments to dependents which were due 1 March in
the total amount of $100,000. This must be done
soonest if ARTINE is to maintain control of the
situation. The next most immediate problem is
re-entry permission for fifteen of his men who have
been stranded in Nicaragua trying to return to the
United States since December. These men were ex-
filtrated "black" from the United States with our
assistance and require special authority for
re-entry from Department of State and Department of
Justice, which we thought was arranged in early
January.

The demobilisation plan proposed by ARTIME
seemed as realistic and effective as could be hoped
for. He proposes to return the bulk of his men,
approximately 200, to the United States during March
and give them one month's pay on 1 April as a mustering-
out payment to support them and their families while
they seek other employment. The balance of his men,
less than 100, will be held in Central America for
one month longer as a security and administrative
force muster the group's equipment at Monkey Point
from which disposition can be made during the month
SECRET
14-00000
-3-
of April. The security force will be returned
during April and will be paid a mustering-out pay-
ment on 1 May. This will terminate the project.

The cover story which ARTINE intends to use
for demobilization is to inform his men that their
mothership is out of commission and will require about
six years for repairs. This is true enough so that
it will be believed. He will then grant leave to all
men with dependents to get their personal affairs in
order before operations commence again. He will
publicize the fact that it is less expensive and
better for morale to send them on leave than to have
men sitting around the camps with no operations to
run. When all the first contingent are back home,
individual notice will be given each to start looking
for other work as operations have been postponed.
They will be told that the salary payment of 1 April
will be the last one and should be considered as a
mustering-out bonus. ARTINE feels this method will
soften the impact and lower the noise level as the
men will be home with their families and scattered
throughout the community instead of being in an
organized group in Central America when they realize
they are being demobilized.

b. Funds. ARTINE had done his homework and
brought with him facts and figures upon which phase-
out costs could be estimated. These cost estimates
are outlined below:

1 March - $100,000 Dependents support and
salaries
35,000 Travel from Central America
to U.S. for approx. 200 men
50,000 Accrued debts due 1 March,
mainly food and other expenses
for camps in Central America
$175,000 (In lieu of regular monthly
subsidy of $225,000)

1 April - $100,000 Mustering-out payment for
200 men and salaries for
security and administrative
details
12,500 Travel from Central America
to U.S. for approx. 100 men
12,500 Estimated food and other camp
expenses
$135,000
SECRET
14-00000
1 May - $ 50,000 Mustering-out payments for
approx. 100 men and final
contractual obligations of
project
$50,000

c. Weapons. ARTINE agreed that it would be in
nobody's interest for his weapons to fall into the wrong
hands. He was asked for ideas on disposition of the
arms and came up with the following suggestion which
appears to be an excellent one. The mothership, MV
SANTA MARIA, is in need of repairs and must go into a
shipyard. Tentative arrangements have been made to
put her in the yards at Galveston, Texas, some time
in March or April. ARTINE can order his security detail
to store the arms aboard the ship for "security" reasons
before she leaves for the yard. They will simply re-
main on board when the ship leaves and we can take
control of the ship and the weapons from that point on.

d. Maritime.

(1) MV SANTA MARIA. See above. The ship
would be sailed from Monkey Point with a contract
crew supplied by
Libernic Corporation.
One of ARTINE's senior officers would accompany
the ship as his representative, with orders to
turn over control of it and the arms upon its
arrival at Galveston. CIA officers, possibly
would accept
custody and Office of Logistics could recover the
weapons and any other equipment which might be
shipped by this method. The ship would then be
disposed of according to Headquarters wishes at
any time after 17 April.

(2) Swifts, V-20's, Boston Whalers, rubber
boats and other operational craft are all owned,
technically, by ARTINE's group. He has

hoping against hope that lightning will strike and
he may, after all, be able to use them in the next

two months. Case officer recommends we go along
with him on this, at least for the time being, as
it could be sticky legally and might antagonize
him at the time when we most need his cooperation.
In the end, he should be reasonable about disposi-
tion of these craft if we shoot square with him
in the meantime.

(3) Support craft, LCMs, Barges, etc. Dispo-
sition arrangements to be worked out together on
these craft.

e. Aircraft.

ARTINE is willing to release the
However, one month's
charter payment of $1,250 was due 1 March, and
another will be due by the time the aircraft can
be back without payment, but also reluctant to
squeeze the $2,500 out of his budget. Case officer
voiced his opinion that the owner would probably
be glad to get the plane back and would not likely
think it worth going to court. However, in view
of the fact that it would be a "closed-circuit"
transaction and would actually cost the Government
nothing, it is recommended that a special authoriza-
tion of $2,500 be channeled to ARTINE for payment
in order to maintain ARTINE's reputation for fiscal
probity. He will surely appreciate this gesture.

(2) L-20 Beaver and Cessna-180. These
aircraft technically belong to ARTINE's group and
recovery would be a sticky matter, legally.
ARTINE hopes to hold control of these aircraft
for the time being, and it is recommended that
we go along with him, saving disposition arrange-
ments until later.

5. ARTINE again emphasized at the close of the meeting
that he must have soonest the March payments for families
as an absolute minimum, before he could face his people and
maintain control of them in order to insure an orderly phase-
out program.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Chief, WH remarks on termination of AMWORLD

1. At a meeting with DCWHD/C and Mr. Jenkins on
16 March, Chief, WH expressed general satisfaction with
the status of termination of AMWORLD and the plans
therefor. He stated specifically that he was pleased
with the cooperation of AMBIDDY-1 and ANJAYA-4 and would
make it a point to inform higher levels in the Agency and
the U.S. Government and put a good word for them on the
record. He also directed that they be told:

a. He personally appreciates their cooperation
and the good sense, goodwill and maturity they
displayed in accepting and executing the U.S.
Government decision to terminate their operations.

b. He wants to meet with them personally, at
the earliest mutually convenient time, in order to
discuss the situation with them.

c. After termination of the paramilitary project
is completed, he has some other ideas for ventures of
mutual interest which he wishes to pursue with them.

2. The gist of the above points had been passed to
AMBIDDY-1 and AMJAVA-4 previously by Mr. Jenkins, and on
the night of 18 March he confirmed by telephone to AMJAVA-4
that Chief, WH had expressed the above sentiments.

1. Hof cable raises a number of fundamental issues of concern to Caracas
Station. In brief, we do not welcome an activation of the movement's center
in Carras, in event which would greatly complicate our operational situation.
to have reasons for believing that the host government likevise would probably
embarrassed if AKBIDDY 1 chose Venezuela as a base for whatever program be
is planning to undertake. Repeated failures of his attempts at being received
by President LEONI are significant in this context.

Since ve must assume tht ANBIDDY 1 has alluded to his close ties with
MUBARK (and nors specifically with BECKHOFF), the Venezuelan security services
may well jump to the conclusion that ANWORLD is in fact & KUBARK operation and
sooner or later we would be forced to disavow ANDIDDY 1, a circumstance of
thich he would be bound to learn with consequent esbitterment. All these
predictable developments, Caracas is most anxious to forestail. Seedless to
say, both BECKHOFF and OPTRICK are unhappy about this situation of conflict
since it involves as we both admire and who (in their opinion) has served
CUTORE isteeste loyally, at times to the detriment of his abiding cause to
liberate PaНИКИ.

3. For the above reasons, we would welcome indeed it formal and
institutional ties between AXBIDOY 1 and ANJAVA & could be put in abeyance, at
Least to the extent that AKBIDOY 1 be prevailed upon to pass up Venesuela as
bese of operations. Dis discriminatory approach reflects our amresses that

the Station's position, as set forth above,
Headquarters with an exceedingly delicate task. While as a last resort
could of course drop discreet hints to our Venezuelan liaison contacts
suggesting the inadvisability of affording ANBIDDY-1 and his associates
sanctuary in Venezuela, we would only entertain that disastrous prospect as
a last resort and with the full approval of Headquarters.

5. Another approach, only slightly less unsatisfactory, would be to
restrict ANBIDDY-1's radius of activity to an extent tantamount to denying
him all freedom of political action while in Venezuela. But all in all, it
would probably be best for KUBARK if ANBIDDY-1 could be dissuaded from going
through with his proposed move in a manner which does not hurt his pride and
which does not alienate him from KUBARK. Headquarters may be able to suggest
palatable alternatives to Venezuela.

6. As regards ANJAVA-4, we share some of Headquarters misgivings about
surfacing him to Liaison. What prompted us to suggest this approach was a
desire to overcome the difficulties which would be facing AMJAVA-4 in any
case should he decide to make his home here. We are inclined to doubt that
he could obtain permission to enter Venezuela in immigrant status without
powerful intercession. He would be used by the Station on projects which
we (and presumably the host government) view as compatible with Venezuela's
national security interests.

7. Some of the doubts raised by Headquarters are altogether valid and
were considered before we made our proposal. We are least concerned, however, about
the issues of dual loyalty and dual control, etc., because it happens to be one of
our objectives in building a more durable relationship with Liaison, esp DIGEPOL,
to entice them into joint ventures where dual control does exist. We find AMJAVA-4
temperamentally suited (esp since his basic loyalty belongs to KUBARK) to serve
as an operational link between Station and Liaison, without acting to the
detriment of either. Although the tenor of our relationship with DIGEPOL has
undergone a notable improvement, there are still deep-rooted reservations and
suspicions which a man of AMJAVA-4's personality traits might heir to dispel.

8. With regards to the substance of our operations against PERUMEN,
especially those which are CB-oriented, there is a natural congruity of interests
between ODYOKE and Venezuela which renders joint pursuits in fact most desirable.
It is more likely than not, that we do Station the favor of facilitating the
admission of AMJAVA-4 and of providing him with viable cover, maybe including
official (DIGEPOL) documentation, and let it go at that. We rather doubt that
unless prodded by Station DIGEPOL would avail itself of ANJAVA-4's services, let
alone use him to penetrate Station's operational program. But it leaves in the
balance the pros and cons of surfacing a valuable KUBARK asset to Liaison.

9. The general concepts guiding Caracas Station in deciding to secure the
services of AMJAVA-4 are spelled out in UG-10059.

10. In presenting Station's proposal to AMJAVA-4, the following points
could be made:

a. We do not propose that he sever his longstanding personal and
political links with AMBIDDY-1.

b. We do not expect that he disconnect his links with AMBIDDY-1, let
alone cease supporting his program.

c. We expect, however, that he will not permit AMBIDDY-1 to use
Venezuela as a base for whatever program he is planning to undertake,
and that he will be prevailed upon to pass up Venezuela as a base of
operations.

d. We expect that AMJAVA-4 will make it clear to AMBIDDY-1 that he
(AMBIDDY-1) will have to make a clear choice between serving the cause
of PR liberation by actively associating himself with the Station's
operational program (provided that our reading of the situation is
correct), or by continuing a program of covert activities under Station
control.
