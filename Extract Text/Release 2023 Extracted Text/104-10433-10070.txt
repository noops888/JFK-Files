1. Forwarded herewith is a pamphlet prepared by the Japan
"Peace for Vietnam" Committee (BEHEIREN) for distribution to U.S.
servicemen stationed in Japan or visiting Japan. BEHEIREN activists
are distributing these pamphlets outside major U.S. bases throughout
Japan. BEHEIREN had planned to drop copies of this pamphlet over
the USS ENTERPRISE and the U.S. Navy Base at Sasebo during the
ENTERPRISE's visit there this month. However, this planned action
fell through due to BEHEIREN's inability to obtain the cooperation
of a Japanese newspaper, MINAMI KYUSHU SHIMBUN, in obtaining a
helicopter for the exercise. POFRAGRANCE/1 obtained this pamphlet
from BEHEIREN headquarters in Tokyo on 16 January.
2. FJTA-53886, which forwarded a locally distributed BEHEIREN
propaganda poster, was not designated MHPASHA but might appropriately
have been so designated.
3. Also forwarded herewith is a clipping from the JCP's
AKAHATA, Sunday edition, 21 January (identical article also appeared
in AKAHATA daily, 13 January). This article announced that
GENSUIKYO printed up 10,000 leaflets, copies of an advertisement
placed in the Chicago Daily News, May 1967. A sample of this
advertisement was sent to GENSUIKYO by Fred Bachiyuruta (phonetic),

We veterans of Vietnam and carlier wars agree with Gen. David M. Shoup (Ret.), U.S. Marine Corps Conmmandant during the
Cuban missile crisis, who said:
"I believe that if we had and would keep our dirty, bloody, dollar-crooked fingers out of the business of these nations so full
of depressed, exploited people, tlicy will arrive at a solution of their own. That they design and want. That they fight and
work for..... and not the American style, which they don't want and above all don't want crammed down their throats by
Americans.

... what is happening, no matter how carefully and slowly the military escalation, ins, progressed, may be projecting us, to-

We veterans of Vietnam and earlier wars agree with Adım. Arnold E. True (Ret.), U.S. Navy, who has written:
"We can end the Vietnam fiasco without dishonor by withdrawing our troops and letting the Vietnamese settle their
own problems."
REAL SUPPORT FOR OUR MEN IN VIETNAM COMES FROM THOSE WHO DEMAND:

N.Y. vets: 'Free Levy'
New York vets joined August 5th in a
3000-strong march led thru Midtown Man
hattan streets by a large contingent of
white-clad doctors, nurses, medical stu
dents and hospital workers. The marchers:
called for release on bail of Dr. Howard B.
Levy, U.S. Army Captain sentenced to
three years at hard labor for refusing to
train Special Forces aldmen' on grounds
they use medicine primarily for political
and military purposes.
At a concluding rally the demonstrators
heard two Viet vets: Dr. Arthur S. Blank.
Jr., chief psychiatrist in Saigon and Bien
Hon hospitals in 1.965-6; and Jan Crumbh,
Coordinator of Vietnam Veterans Against
the War.
Dr. Blank said, "Officers and sergeants
in this country and abroad, in basic train-
ing centers, in hospitals, and in the base
camps in Vietnam, building and maintain-
ing an army and fighting a war, know
full well that among them many dis-
sent from national policy and object to
the war. Opposition does not stop at the
induction center. In my experience, the
belief that what we are doing in Asia is
wrong, is as widespread in the Army as
it is among all our people."
"The soldier's patience is great, but it
is not endless," Dr. Blank concluded, "and
we thank Dr. Levy for reminding the na-
tion of that. Someday, what is happening
this summer in America's cities, could
happen in America's army. We do not.
have forever to end this war."

Dear Editor:
Shoup

Vietnam was willing to negotiate.
The program opened with the following
tribute paid to General Shoup by President
Johnson in a White House ceremony in
1963 upon Shoup's retirement as Com-
mandant of the Marine Corps:
"We have come here to the first house
of the land today to honor General David
M. Shoup, not because of the victories:
which he has brought to our country, but
also for the honors he has brought to our
heritage. He is a man of great discipline
who cares about people.
deeply regret his retirement from the
service for he is one of an uncommon
breed whose numbers are too small and
whose duplication is too rare. I would per-
sonally have had him continue as Com-
mandant of the Marine Corps."
It followed with:
GEN. SHOUP (speaking to Senli, Aur-
gust, 1967): I don't believe that, with re-
spect to the freedom and security of the
people of the United States of America.
