Mr. Tweedy. I do.
Senator Schweiker.
It has been nice meeting you.
Mr. Tweedy. Thank you very much.
(Whereupon, Senator Schweiker left the hearing room.)
(Discussion off the record.)
Mr. Baro.. Mr. Tweedy, you have just received the oath
from Senator Schweiker, who has now left the room, and you are
under no obligation to continue to testify in his absence, but
obviously the Committee would appreciate it greatly if you
would continue to testify.
Are you willing to continue to testify in the Senator's
absence?
Mr. Tweedy. I plan to testify fully.
Mr. Baron.. You are willing to testify to the truth as bes
as you can do it?
Mr. Weedy. I will indeed.
Mr. Baron. Are you aware that you have the right to
counsel?

Mr. Baron. All right, then.
Let us proceed to review a set of documents which were not
available to us in your first examination.
The attempt here
today is not to go over a lot of old ground that we covered
in your first examination but to focus our concerns on a few
main events in the alleged story of an assassination plot
against Lumumba, and to refresh your recollection by review of
these documents.
Let me introduce as Exhibit 1 a cable from Allen Dulles
to the Leopoldville Station, marked for Robert Guthman on
October 26th, 1960.

TESTIMONY OF BRONSON TWEEDY
Mr. Baron. We discussed this cable in your previous
appearance, did we not?
Mr. Tweedy. August 26th.
5
May I correct the date? It is August 26th.
6
Mr. Baron.
Certainly.
7
Mr. Tweedy.
It is rather important.
8
Mr. Baron.
It is August 26th.

Mr. Tweady.
Yes, we did indeed discuss it the last time.

Mr. Baron.
After you took another look at this cable

you were concerned at the time.

Is that your impression now?
1.
Mr. Tweedy. Yes.

I.
Let me just add to that a bit.
The cable per se I did not
1 remember, but it is perfectly obvious the cable is the authority.
1-
When I first talked to Mr. Bissell about this, he certainly
implied the only reason the subject was being raised is because
it had been of national policy level concern. I do not think
it could be more clear-cut than that. This was basically, this
was the formal expression of that by the Director himself.
I cannot remember which came first, did I see this cable
first, or did I talk to Mr. Bissell first. I suspect that I
talked to Mr. Bissell first.
It must have been absolutely in

do not exclude that, but the two were totally in tandem.

that we are about to introduca into the record today, before
we begin taking your testimony on the record, are you able to
pinpoint with any more precision your initial discussion with
Mr. Bissell of the prospect of assassinating Lumumba?
Mr. Tweedy. Pinpoint it in terms of time?
Mr. Baron.

Mr. Baron. It would have taken place shortly before this
Allen Dulles cable?
Mr. Tweedy. Either shortly before, or shortly after,
because the next series of cables obviously get the show, as
it ware, on the road.
May I comment just generally on those cables as a group?
There are no surprises in them as far as I am concerned, in
terms of detail. Much of it, even to this day, I still do not
remember.
One aspect emerges very clearly for me, that we were ver
careful about examining this on the possibilities of doing
anything against Lumumba. Rasically, this whole period was a

This marely confirmed what I think I probably heard from
Mr. Bissell first.
Mr. Baron. In this discussion with Mr. Bissell, you are

7
Mr. Tweedy. I think it probably came up in the sense that
the thrust of the American position was that there was no
solution in the Congo without the fall from power of Mr. Lumumba,

to call it that.
Mr. Baron.. Meaning assassination?
Mr. Twaady. Yes.
But none of these possible measures wers excluded, and the
main point was that everybody agreed that Lumumba had to go or
We ware in for very serious trouble in the Congo.
Mr. Baron. You were referring a moment ago in discussing
this cable from Allen Dulles to the fact that when you first

of removing him from power with Richard Bissell, Bissell referre
to this cable.
