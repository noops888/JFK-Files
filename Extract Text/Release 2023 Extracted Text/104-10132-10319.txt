i. With reference to Ralph PEREZ who is mentioned in
paragraph 2 of the attached memorandum on Richard S. CAIN
dated 9 October 1967, he would appear in all probability to be
Subject who in the spring of 1963 became of interest to DCS (OC/C)
for routine exploitation as a source of foreign positive intelligence.
2. On 28 June 1963, Security advised DCS regarding an un-
substantiated report that Subject subscribed to the Communist
publication "VOZ de MEXICO" and was a Communist leader in
1944. He reportedly was a leader of the Communist nucleus in
the Chicago Mexican colony. According to a notation dated 6/26/63,
this information was considered resolved in Subject's favor through
1959 B.I. conducted on Subject's sister." DCS was also informed
that Subject's sister (Maria Guadalupe GALLARDO, with various
akas) was reported by reliable informants to have been a member
of the Mexican Commission of the Communist Party in 1946 and a
card carrying Communist Party member in 1951. During an inter-
view in 1954, she admitted attending meetings of the Communist
Party and a Communist Party school during the mid-1930's in Chicago
but denied having attended Communist Party affairs subsequent to 1945,
ore ever having been a member of the Communist Party.
3. With reference to Guillermo ESCOBAR, whom Subject
(PEREZ) is said to have given Horace SPEED II, #199 499, as a
lead, he may or may not be Guillermo (ESCOBAR) MARTINEZ, aka:
Guillermo (MARTINEZ) ESCOBAR, #444 260, a Mexican citizen who
in October 1956 was issued an operational approval for use as a mem-
ber of the LIPSTICK Team in Mexico under unindicated cover. This
approval was cancelled by WH/III in a memorandum dated 9 November
1957. There is no derogatory information in ESCOBAR's file and no
information on him since 1957.
