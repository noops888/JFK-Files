A. PaulAR ICHARDSON - Thio peroon may be
identifiable with Poul RICHARDSON (EM-5861,
alias for Paul Kuhiman HEIM, DPOR, 18 April 1930.
Greonaville, Pennsylvania. He was described in 1968 08
whito, 6 ft., 2-3 inches; 175 pounds; black hair, greying
and balding on top; bluo oyos, wears glasses for reeding;
leen build; appeared in good physical condition and dressed
well. Was an aviation consultant and pilot. He was dropped
from LNLEVY on 1 May 1967 with prejudice. In March 1967
HEIM advertised in a U.S. aviation trade newspaper for a
co-pilot or co-pilot mechanic to fly primarily in Europe.
HEIM inferred to a candidate (informant) that he was
connected with JKLANCE overseas and that he was an
officer in the LNLEVY reserve. Upon arrival in Zurich,
Switzerland in April 1967, HEIM told the candidato that he
would not be employed by Transair es previously indicated,

but as a pilot for Count 2ΑΝΟΝ (AKA ZENON and ZANNON),
and a Georgio MONDADORI. ZANON was reported
to be a banker, and MONDADORIa publisher of magazines
and books. The 11 June 1971 issue of the Washington Post
carried the obituary for Arnoldo MONDADORI, Italy's
number one publisher who retired two years previously leaving
the publishing house in the hands of his son Giorgio. Yearly
sales were caid to average $120 million dollars. On the above
mentioned trip to Zurich, HEIM was involved in smuggling
a large trunk (contents unknown) through customs in Torino,
Italy by bribing the officials. HEI M purchased a King Air
Beechcraft in May 1966 valued at approximately $500,000,
which was registered to him for tax purposes but owned by
two wealthy Italians. HEIM's U.S. business address in
1968 was Paul K. HEIM, Aviation Consultant, Hays Street,
Gettysburg, Pa. 17325. The foregoing was based on LNERGO
reports.

By memo datod November 1967, VOMACE requested LNERGO
to procure a list of toll calle made from the office of Panther
Publications in Boulder, Colorado, and a similar list of toll
callo made from the home of Robert K. Brown. This request
was made as a result of Brown'o harrassment of JKLANCE
with the avowed intent of publishing a book exposing JKLANCE
oporations. ĽNERGO advised that there was not sufficient
indication to justify an investigation falling within LNERGO
jurisdiction, thus the request was never serviced.

this subject may be identifiable with one Villiam John DEMPSEY,
aka Bill, DEOD: 19 February 1941, Canada. In May 1969 he was
described as blond hair; single; maintenance worker: Canadian
citizen: left arm 4 inches shorter than right arm. He went to
the Miami axga in about 1961, Claimed to be a veteran of the
Canadian Army. He became involved with American mercenaries
and adventurers who formed a group under Gerald Patrick
HEMMING, veteran of the U.S. Marine Corpa, previously
reported in Brown traffic. This group volunteered their services
to various Cuban exiles who were then planning military expeditions
to overthrow the Government of Cuba. Most of the persons in the
group had criminal records and under police pressure left the
Miami area. DEMPSEY has been involved in Cuban and
Haitian matters since that time. He has been a technical advisor
to many Cuban exile groups concerning plans to infiltrate
and launch missions against Cuba. Was involved with Rolando
MASFERRER Rojas, et al, in planned ea invasion of
Haiti in 1966. The participants were arrested by LNYAPA
officials, but DEMPSEY evaded apprehension. In March 1969

he was arrested and incarcerated in Monroe County Jail, Key West, Florida,
along with eleven other persons, in connection with an accident at a secret
military camp discovered in the Florida Everglades, allegedly being used by
Haitian exiles preparing to invade Haiti, DEMPSEY was the commander
in charge of operations and training. DEMPSEY and the other camp
commander, Edmund KOLBY, were in charge of disbursements. In June 1969
DEMPSEY participated in a bombing mission at Port-Au-Prince, Haiti,
was deported from the Bahamas to Miami and arrested there by LNYAPA agents.
He later was returned to Canada but was not prosecuted. In September 1969
DEMPSEY advised an LNERGO informant that he still resided in Canada
and was associated with an American (not further identified) who was then
writing a book about the assassination of President Kennedy.

S. John T. DUNCAN
A Tom DUNCANis cited in previous SLAFTER
traffic (DBA-28117, 19 November 1962) (201-309125) as one of a
group of men headed by Gerald Patrick HEMMING training
on the koy. He was the owner of a newspaper in Moore Haven,
Florida and appeared to be handling publicity and public relations
for the group.
One John Thomas DUNCAN (201-841921) was contacted
and assessed in July 1968 for use as a reporter/announcer for
the AMWIDE production facility. DUNCAN accepted the
AMWIDE job after a visit to Miami in August 1968 and discussion
with JKLANCE officers; however, in a follow-up contact with a
Headquarters officer in October 1968, declined the position.
One Richard DUNCAN (UFAT-345, 6 January 1968)
associated with Time Magazine, Columbus, Georgia, assisted
