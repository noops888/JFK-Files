:
:
1. SLAPSTICK-1: Nothing new on the anonymous threat; no new letters or
phone calls. 3-1 has a new job, his now employer does not know about the
problem. I told P to tell 3-1 the FBI is investigating the case. Note:
change in job may affect S-1's ability to travel, it my be difficult
to go leave for any length of time so soon after coming on the job. I
told Pive are zeroing in on Luciano YAZQUEZ 1 Rotterdam, waiting for
confirmation of his ICS presence there, also whether family is with him.
Vill have P contact FERIANDEZ de la Prosilla (old friend of V's) in Port
Charlotte, then make decision on how to make approach, using either S-1
or FERNANDEZ. Also gave P 2 photos (from Sylvia) to show S-1, to determine
whether he recognizes either and if so, to, obtain background and assessrent
info. Fhotos os Carlos LASTRA modoros and uniden Cuban male.
2. SLALOM-1: Phad not yet received latest cable on S-1; I told him FBI
wants to contact S-1, and we agreed to advise 3-1 that SA C'Brion from
Hewark office would azłk contact S-1 at h me on 20 Nov. P will write a
letter to S-1 airmail special delivery on 14 Nov. Also gave P instructions
to query 5-1 whether he or wife knew Panamanian dip l'iguel Antonio, HERNAL
Villalaez when they were in Kaixit Paris; If S-1 knew him, or of him,
P will go to M and lebrief him in depth.
3. UNRUMBLE-2: I told P that li-2 load Guillermo PAR IENTCS has a couple
relatives in Mia i area, whom we would have Pcheck out as soon as we
have FBI traces, to determine what B's actual position is in Cuba (National
or provincial mental health) and any useful assesstents; after which,
decision will be mode whether we will pursue this lead with U-2.
4. Rafael CURE LC Rodriguez: P's debriefing of brother Teodoro not yet
received. P said Teodoro was very cooperative, cager to help. Teodoro
brought up subject of Juan ARAUJO, relatives in California, said A is
is bad news, we should under no circumstances contact hi for access
or news of Rafael. Details follow in CR; this agrees with Has views.
Toedoro revealed that Rafael had been in Nassau for a couple of months last
summer, we could probably have gotten in contact with him then. No info
on when he might travel again.
5. Pablo PACAS Rodriguez: P's contact report of atg with brother Humberto
not received. Humberto doesn't write, keep abreast of Pablo's life thru
relatives. Pablo is low-level, doesn't have any influential contacts to
help him win better position, would like to leave but can't desert family,
is just getting along by accomodating with the regime. On the face ofit,.
he doesn't look like much of an SLS: LASE recruitment target. Will wait for
P's contact re ort for final decision.
6. 7. We talked at length about current effort to identify, locate and
debrief likely sources of ops leads. P will consider all his contacts in
liari area and come up with proposal. ill also start to compile list of
various professional and geographical refugee associations flourishing in
Miami area, as sources for info on locating people of interest. P said he
is willing to locate and debrief specific individuals, but feels he should
be careful about wholesale "beating the bushes", which might get him too
well identified in exile community. I agreed; if he should avoid an specific
contact for security reasons, sorecne else will handle, ity tomorrow at Jonis.

SUBJECT:
Debriefing of
UNRUMBLE-2
6 August 975
LX-4064
re SLAB3A-1. (S-1)
1. UNRUMBLE-2 (Dr.) was debriefed on the afternoon of 1 August,
re his knowledge of S-1. Although we had to scurry around
the city and suburbs to locate the good Dr., it was well worth
it.
For reference purposes, the Dr. can be located at:
4.
Re our primary objective, the De. produced the following facts on 5-1:
FAMILY:
DPO3: C. 1935 in Las Villas province, Cuba. Caucasian male,
Mother: fnuj
ОРОВ: с. 1910 in Cuba. She was a public
school teacher in Santo Domingo, Las Villas province, where
the Dr. grew up. Sea....
and secundary school.
Father: Believed to be
(Sra.) taught Dr. in elementary
(mat. unknown) DPOВ: С.
1910 in Cuba. The father ran a rooming house and club at the
local beach ("La Fanchita.")..
It was.c. 1946-47, when Dr. first met S-1, at the beach club..
owned by the father. Or. recalls that religion never played any
part in S-1's life: "They did not practise any religion and, in
fact, the father spoke against religion. I think he was a PSP
(Partido Socialista Popular, the Cuban Communist Party in that
era) member." 5-1 was the only child the
!
PRE SCHOOL, SCHOOL AND ADOLESCENSE:
had.
The Dr. talks: "He was an only child and he was very spoiled,
especially by his father. They were moral people and had a
certain position of respect in that small town. The mother
attempted to teach him to study hard and become a professional
but (5-1) liked to party more than study. When he went to high
school in Santa Clara (capital of Las Villas province) he ran
around with a bad bunch of students who were always partying
and studying very little."
i
In c. 1954, when Dr. and S-1 were preparing to enter the University
of ilavana, the father set up a boarding house in Havana for the
students from their L.V. area. | Dr. and 5-1 roomed together for
over 2 years: "We slept in the same room for two years. We got
to know each other even better. He was not a very good student
because he would not study. He was more interested in having a
good time. In his second or third year at the University -I
think he was studying to be an engineer or achitect- he dropped
out, he flunked out. He then went to help his father with his
business and continued his partying."
MARITAL LIFE AND SEXUAL CONDUCT:
Dr. did not know that S-1 was married, "He was a very romantic
person; he fell in love very easily but only had one woman at a
time. But, I think he had an inferiority complex. When we went.
to a dance together, he didn't go for the pretty ones -I did- and
he sought out the ugly ones. He wanted to be sure he got a girl;
that he wasn't rejected."FORWARDED BY SPLIT TRANSMISSION
GENERAL STATE OF HEALTH: NO FIELD DISSEMINATION
He liked
"He was always healthy. He was strong and athletic.
to defend people against bullies. He would try to reason with
those who were taking advantage of the weaker ones."
EMOTIONAL REACTIONS:
RECORD COPY
"He is generally a pleasant person. He loves to joke and we
liked to play practical jokes on others. When he's not joking
he gives the appearance of confidence; you accept him easily.
He is not handsome but he looks pleasant. When you begin talking
with him you continue; you don't drop him, as you would a boring
person."

EMOTIONAL REACTIONS (continued)
And the Or. continues: "But he is quitter; a loser. When he
flunked out of the University of Havana he accepted it without
fighting back. He could have accepted the fact that he did not
study, that he spent more time at parties than with his books.
So, he could have fought back; he could have told himself that he
was going to change his life style and complete his career.
didn't fight back; didn't change his ways and accepted the results
as inevitable; something that fate had predestined for him and that
was that."
MENTAL PROCESS:
"He is not intelligent but he is sharp; he's not a dope.
I would say he learned by watching others do things rather
than he being inventive."
RELATIONS:
+
He
"He got along with everyone. He treated everyone with respect.
He didn't take advantage of others. He liked to have people around
him. Perhaps it came from growing up in boarding houses where there
was always people around. He liked to pull practical jokes on
others but in fun. Unfortunately, he joined a group of bums in ::
high school and that led him to a bad life style. Perhaps his
inferiority complex was to blame for him joining this fast crowd.
I don't think any of those buns could be termed a good friend.
I don't know that he had any friends that are now outside of Cuba."
PATTERNS OF CONDUCT:
"He is lazy. He depends on others. I'm certain he knows that he
is not prepared to fight it out and make good in a society outside
of Cuba. In my case, if I wasn't here in the US, I could go anywhere
in the world and make out. He has to recognise that the Castro
regime has given him.prestige, position, recognition that he can't
obtain going anywhere else. So, it is going to be very difficult
to move him from the position he now has. While he is not ambitious,
not the type to betray you to get ahead, he does like the good
life, the good clothes, the good drinks and food. If you want to
capture him it would have to be offering him more that Castro has
given him as far as position. You also have to recognize that
he is very attached to his parents... If they are alive, it is very
unlikely that he will defect. Also, does he have any children?
Are they with him or back in Cuba? He would not desert them, for
sure."
lle liked to
And, the Dr. continued: "He is very paternalistic.
give advice and protect the weak from people who wanted to take
advantage of them, but he never applied this advice to himself.
I think he was a bit envious of me and again he admired me
because I was a fighter. Kany was the morning after a party that
he tried to discourage me from going to class and stay in bed.
But I got up and fought while he went back to sleep and didn't
go to classes."

DR'S CONCLUSIONS:
"I would be glad to make an approach to him but, as I said
previously, it would not be easy to capture him unless he is
about to lose his position. Has he changed his life style;
or is he still partying around?"
Or. said that S-1 has no Revolutionary background and that he
never expressed himself as a leftist in sentiments. "I do not
believe that he is a' Karxist." The Dr. believes: that S-l's
father who was PSP probably got S-1 into KINREX through his old
Communist Party friends and that S-1 has accomodated himself
into a comfortable position.
:
Dr., Fecalls that he last saw S-1 in Cuba in c. 1960-61. They
met at parties and S-1 was still a wine, women and song man.
In c. 1961, Dr. left to study in Paris. In c. 1962-63, Dr.
was instructed to write S-1 a warm/friendly letter from Paris
(S-1 was in the Hague) but although S-1 answered, it was "cool."
"I had asked him to drop by and have a drink and talk over old
times but you could see from his answer that he wasn't accepting
my offer. Ile never wrote to me again and I never heard about him,
either."
Or. had a difficult time remembering that S-1 had resided briefly
in the US. At first he didnot remember anything. Later, only
vaguely; so vaguely he could not give any facts. (NOTE: Was
Dr. the source of the fact S-1 resided briefly in the US and was
anti US because of Segro problem?)
Dr's complex schedule/responsibilities at the center he directs
precludes his availability to pitch S-1 without at least a 6 (six)
weeks advance notice so he can arrange his affairs. Please
remember to take this fact into consideration if it is decided to
use Dr's services.
7. This is the sum total of Dr's contributions on 1 August. Naturally,
it was limited to the time available. If there are unanswered
questions, I am certain Dr. will be more than glad to answer them
on any subsequent trips to NYC. Dr. did not want to have our
relationship end and asked me for an address where he could contact
me if he had anything of interest. He now has my Miami PO Box
and, I expect, we'll be hearing from him in the future.
Last note: Or. did not know that S-1 had any relatives in the US.

Debriefing of Dr. Pedro RUIZ Quintero, re SLABBA-1. (5-1).
Dr. RUIZ (Dr.) was debriefed on the afternoon of 1 August,
re his knowledge of S-l. Although we had to scurry around
the city and suburbs to locate the good Jr., it was well worth
it.
For reference purposes, the Dr. can be located at:
130 NYAC (no K) Ave. (his home)
Pelham, New York
tel (914) 738-5785.
Lincoln Community Mental Health Center
781 East 142nd Street
(He is the Director
and psychiatrist)
Bronx, NY
tel. (212) 993-1500 ext. 233.
2. It was at his office that I was able to talk with the Dr.
Although he was very busy and about to embark on Kexico
vacation the next day, he wis gracious enough to contribúte
valuable insights or the character/personality and Background
of 5-1. Or. look. Looks is ame (c. 39) but would look younger if he
would take off 30 3. He is about 5-9, 200, 150. His manner
is pleasant, friendly, eager to please but very much on an ego
trip. While I wis attemoting to steer the convers Lion towards
5-1, Dr. could not mely but thump his chest on the great jeb
he was doing at the mental health center he ran.
Ithough the
project's name is gessive, it is situated in a loft building
adjacent to the Lincoln Hospital in a slum section of the Bronx.
He told me he was combating the inroads being rade in the
community by the Black Power and Puerto Rican Bartonalist
element by subtly relating nis Cuban experience.
3.
Asked if he was aware of any involvement of Ul based Cubans in
his hospital and roloi orojects, he said Lue Cuins did not
come to his turf buc the radical elements at the hospital visited
the Cuban Fission ant some even went to Cuba. Since this appeared
to be "internal" or sareau jurisdiction and the Sr. did not have
nou delve into this matter. fit is
into it the next time i an in the NC area.
