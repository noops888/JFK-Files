I talked with Mr. Earl Myers of the Comptroller's Office about
this and he said that the attached memo leaves certain information
to be desired.
1. What were the original arrangements made with Customs for the
use of this man and who made them.
2. Arrangements for the continued use of this man should be made
by W/2/ or by Cover Division for W/2/.
3. When the arrangements for his services have been laid on inter-
agency, then the manner of reimbursement for his salary can be
made as agreed upon.
