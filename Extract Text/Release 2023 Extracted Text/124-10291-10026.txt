Sanchez Ocejo and Colonel Pedro Valdivia Romero during
the period September to December, 1964, regarding the
movement to establish a Cuban government in exile in
Haiti after the Duvalier Government has been overthrown.

In early October, 1964, Dr. Sanchez informed

ing from various sources, but he was not specific as to

RE: INSTITUTO CUBANO DE LA DEMOCRACIA
MM T-1 advised that on November 14, 1964, Col-
onel Valdivia left Miami without notifying individuals
with whom he was in close contact. He arrived back in
Miami from New York on November 24, 1964. Upon his re-
turn, he immediately contacted Dr. Sanchez, inasmuch as
Sanchez was to introduce him to some individual of im-
portance. (W)
Early in December, 1964, Colonel Valdivia
informed MM T-1 that he had had no further contact with
his superior in Haitian matters, and that he had nothing
to suggest to further the Haitian movement. It appeared
to source that Colonel Valdivia had changed after his
trip to New York. He also changed, possibly, because he
had been interviewed by U. S. Customs Service and U. S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) at Miami.
MM T-1, at that time, did not expect any new activity on
the part of ICD, or individually on the part of Dr. San-
chez or Colonel Valdivia, Antonio Paz, or others, in view
of the recent developments.
*(u)
On December 6, 1964, Dr. Sanchez informed MM T-1
he had no new information concerning the Haitian affair.
Dr. Sanchez mentioned that efforts were being made to ob-
tain some help from possible sources, but no specific
mention was made as to any possible source.
*(4)
MM T-1, on December 23, 1964, advised that he
knew of no activity on the part of Dr. Sanchez, Colonel
Valdivia, Antonio Paz, or Jose Antonio Maceo. As to
Maceo, the source stated that no mention has been made
of him since the original discussions were held with Dr.

On November 7, 1964, Wallace Shanley, Assistant
Customs Agent in Charge (Enforcement), Customs Agency
Service, Miami, advised as follows:
To his knowledge, none of the groups planning
anti-Duvalier activity have departed for Haiti.
U. S. Customs was asked by the U. S. Department
of Justice to interview several individuals who were in-
volved in anti-Duvalier activities. On November 7, 1964,
U. S. Customs interviewed Colonel Pedro Valdivia, a Cuban
exile in Miami.
On December 7, 1964, Mr. Charles R. Challandes,
Investigations, INS, Miami, Florida, advised that Colonel
Pedro Valdivia had been interviewed in connection with
this matter by U. S. INS. He also advised that his office
had no record of Jose Antonio Maceo Estrado. He added
this file may possibly be located in the New York District
Office of INS.
