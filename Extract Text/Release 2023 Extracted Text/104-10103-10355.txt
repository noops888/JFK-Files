dealt with "the identification of iron and manganese in
minerals by the use of noutrons" and another with research
in Mchanging the physical properties of bagasse to five it
solidity and durability; in order to achieve this the
Tho
bagasse was treated with muclear radiation".
newspaper, Juventud Rebelde, reported on 22 Aurust that a
paper was presented at the same meeting on the subject of
thermonuclear powerplants by MARIO FLEITES, head of the
Department of Future vevelopment of the Emprest Ein prest Consolidada
de la Flectricidad. FLEITES estimated 1980 as the
earliest possible date for work to begin on such a plant.
2. The 29 October broadcast, made by Hammel Juan SOHOZA,
claimed that research into the use of nuclear energy for
economic growth during the previous five your was
producing the necessary technical and scientific knowledge;
Cuban leaders expected to have nuclear plants generating
electricity ia cuba in the near future. More than 10
institutes, including ININ, were involved in the work.

3. A. Prensa Latina report, istelined Hoscow, appeared
in Granaa of 10 December quoting the Russian Vice-Minister
of Energy and Electrification, Nikolai D MATTSEU,
annencing the project study for an "atomelectric" plant
in Cuba. The plant would have two reactors of 100 or.
500 megawatts. (The proposal for such a study was
presumably discussed by the aussian energy dologation,
led by the Minister of Energy and Electrification, Piotr
S NEPOROZHNI, which visited Cuba in the second week of
October 1974; it would also seen probable that the
project was included in the agenda deait with in the first

Commission for Economic und Scientific/Tochnical collaboration
which was led on the Russian side by Vladimir N NOVIKOV.

As I have already reported, a US professor of nucleer
physics, Jerome STEFFENS, is in Cuba at present, lecturing
at Havana University. There may, of course, be no
connection between STEFFENS and the cuclear research
already taking place in cuba for thereonaclear power plants.
However, when I not STEEFENS briefly on 7 December (having
already metais wife some three days earlier) he said be

Since drafting the above I have spoken to Dorothy
STLFTERS on their hotel telephone on 17 December.
She said
that they were leaving for Barbados on 18 December and so
were unable to accept the invitation I had given them.
The also remarked that the matter her husband had wished
to discuss had lost its urgency: it could wait until their
next visit in 1975.
