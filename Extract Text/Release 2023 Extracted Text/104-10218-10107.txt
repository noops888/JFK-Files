MM T-l advised that on October 13, 1952, a news
photographer from Cincinnati, Ohio, appeared at the
training camp and wanted to take pictures, and at that
time, there were between twenty and twenty-five Cuban
exiles receiving military training with about eight
Americans as instructors. The news photographer was
subsequently identifier 23 MARK LAOSYAN of television
station KW, Cleveland, Ohio, who also represented the
Westinghouse Broadcasting Syaten. MM 2-1 explained that

On October 29, 1962, MM -l advised that on

camp had returned to Miami, withered whatever money they

had a total of between $500.00 and $600.00. They planned
to borrow or rent a beat, and thereafter go on a military
expedition to Cuba.
INTERFEN plane to go in two groups, each group
containing about five een, and when they arrive in Cuba,
they will separate. They plan to participate in guerrilla
warfare and demolitions for a period of from one to two
weeks, and then steal any available boat and go to Cay Sal,
Bahamas, where they can easily be rescued by the United
States Coast Guard.
On November 13, 1962, MM 7-1 advised that GERALD

formerly in the Cuban Navy, operate the beat, and they
plan to go to Cuba in the near future.

expedition. HZMMING and his group said that they would
return fire on any federal goverrcent group that tried
to stop them, including the United States Navy.
