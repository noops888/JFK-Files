Qusted below is the text of an ODENVY repart, dated 11 October 1963, on
subject publicstion. Although much of it is a duplication of the information
which vas provided the Station in earlier correspondence, ve are forwarding the
report in the event the information in the last paragraph has not come to
your attention.
Y-1, a confidential source abroad, has advised that the publi-
cation "African Revolution" vas created by the Algerian Front of Bational
Liberation. Its English language edition is published in Switzerland.
There have been several changes in the editorial composition and policy
of "African Revolution" recently, according to T-1. Following a dis-
agreement with EEN BELLA, JACQUES CAMILLE VERGES, the editor of the
publication, vas dismissed from his functions. VERGES is an Algerian
national, who was born March 5, 1925. His place as editor vas taken
by MOHAMED HARBI, former Secretary General of the Algerian Ministry of
Foreign Affairs. Since HARBI becsze editor, the editorial policy has
changed; and the June 1963 issue of "African Revolution" indicated
that the journal is now closely reflecting BEN BELLA's policy and
attempting to promote a sore Algerian image.
* Although VERGES is no longer commected with the Algerian
venture, he continues to publish the English digest of "African
Revolution! from Laussame, Switzerland. The July 1963 issue vas
retitled "Africs, Latin America, Asia Revolution." The phrase "the
third world," which is now in vogue among VERGES's group to describe
the underdeveloped nations of Africa, South America, and Asia indi-
eates the scope of the magazine in its new fora. T-1 described
this publication with which VERGES is presently connected as pro-
communist.
Two members of the Lausame office of the "African Revolution"
have remained loyal to VERGES after he vas replaced by HARBI. They
are FREDY GILEERT FILS ANDERSSON, a Swedish national who was born an
Fegruary 14, 1933, in Lausanne, and RICHARD THOMAS GIBSON, a United
States citizen who was born May 13, 1931, in Los Angeles.

"ANDERSSON apparently heads the office of the Lausanne edition
of "African Revolution" with offices at 10-11 Metropole, Lausanne.
He is also editor-secretary of "Societe Cooperative Clartes Editions."
"GIRSON has U. 8. Passport Ho. B-131994 which was issued at
Washington, D. C. on January 25, 1961. His wife is JOY HARJORIE GIBSON,
nee KATE, who was born July 12, 1926, in London.. She is a British
subject, carries British passport C156546, and is also a journalist.
She resides in Lausanne at 17 Escaliers du Marche, where she arrived
from Algeria in late April 1963 (this also is presumbly the residence
of her husband, PICHARD THOMAS GIRGOR.)
"According to 7-1, VERGES has been denied permission to enter
Switzerland. The case against ANDERSSON is still pending (probably
relating to whether or not he will be allowed to remmin in Switzerland.)
RICHARD THOMAS GIBBON has been refused a Swiss resident's permit and
has been ordered to depart from Switzerland before December 15, 1963."
Augusta R. Kiha
H.B. A KINESK analysis of the publications both before and after the
change of editors in May 1963 shows no significant change in the editorial
policy of either the Algerian or the Swiss based versions, as is suggested
in paragraph 1 of the ODEVY report. The Algiers edition also continues
to reflect a pro-ChiCom policy. Also, to our knowledge Verges is a French
national not an Algerisa national.
