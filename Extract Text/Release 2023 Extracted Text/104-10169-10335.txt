1. On about 20 December 1960, William L. Costille attended as Consular Corpe
function as part of his normal cover duties. Also attending was the new Soviet
Vice Consul, Anatoliy Mikhaylovich KLLOV. KLIPOV's name first came to the Station's
Zattention through AHOLLY/92 who reported in HALS 0632, 2y August 1900, that ALi 19-1
interviewed A/92 personally at the Soviet zabassy prior to issuing his a Soviet
visa. This Is the first time known that there have been two officers at the Soviet
Consulate, a Consul and a Vice Consul. There have been consular clerks, tut note
functioning as an actual Vice Consul. Costille recalls that om of Grigoriy Ye.
GOLUB's chief complaints when he was consul was that he was overworsed as the
only officer in the Consulate. ('n two occasions during time fall of 1900 KLIMOV
phoned Costille on official consular business. He was very friendly on the pacne
and stated that he hoped Costille and he could meet soon.
2. At the 20 December function, Costille and KLi-OV were part of about 40
Consular Corps members touring the AGA factory in Helsinki, a Finnish subsidiary
of a Swedish company making beacon lights, television sets, etc. after a short
while Costille was introduced to MIMOV, and later quite by coincidence the two
sat next to one another at lunch. Following the lunca Costille offered to drive
KLINOV back to the Soviet ambassy. Cu the trip to the ambassy Costille suggested
the two stop for coffee and cognio at a nearby restaurant, to which KLINOV readily
agreed.
3. Biographic information: KLIMOV appears to be in the neighborhood of 35
years old, speaks alow but good English. he is approximately 5'9" tall, stocky
but not stout, has a broad face and brown air. (He does not presently have a
moustache, although the REICAT Notebook picture shows him with one.) He has a
pleasant face with a natural amilo, He is friendly, polite, soft spoken, but
gives the impression of being quite sure of himself. His personality seems to t
just the opposite from his superior in the Consulate, Consul Ivan Yerimovich.
SERGEYEV, SERGEYEV was not present at this particular function, but Costille
has met him once or twice at previous Consular Corps functions. Stays is
polite but has never shown any aigns of friendliness. He is somentat pompous
and frankly a cold fish. KLINOV stated that he (KLLOV) was from Moscow. (Cos
tille is not sort in if he was born there.) He was educated at the University
of Moscow and he stated that his major subject was the United States. KLINO
is married-and he made a point of telling Costille that he is quite happily
married-and has one daughter about eight years old. The daughter is in shivai
in the Soviet Union; however, the occasionally visits Helsinki. At the Consular
Corps luncheon KLIROV appeared to enjoy himself, was friendly to everyone, and
made a point of shaking everyone's hand upon his departure.
4. When Costille and KLIMOV were alone in the bar, KLIMOV fairly quickly
purned the conversation to a comparison of Soviet and Western systems. However,
at all times he remained polite and listened closely to Costille's side of the
discussion. KLIMOV started the conversation by stating that he thought "night
life" (i.e., niglit oluba, dancing, oto.) was a waste of time and that he personaliy
preferred reading and the arta. Ho atted that in the United States there suamed
to be too much emphasis on "night life", which has a particularly bad influence
on young people. He compared the current state of the United States to the woman
Empire which he stated fell as a result of its own decadence and lack of purpose.
Costille asked tilm where he reaalvorm his impression of the United States and if
during his studlas he had tied Augees to Western literature. He anawared only
that his mejor in the Univerally was tine United States and skipped the question
on his access to Western literature, KLIMOV talked on the usual propaganda 11,
such as why the United States insisted upon supporting diotutorships, ato, the
refused to acknowledge that his own country was a dictatorship or that the Joviet

Union had any control over the satellite countries. ALILOV criticized American
Jazz, zovies, juvenile delinquency, etc. withough quite definite in ais own
baliars, Liny listened attentively to what Costiile had to say and took criticiszs
of his own country in stride. as the two were leaving the restaurant, ALLMOV
told Costille that in answer to costille's earlier question on the availability
of Western literature in the Soviet Union he could only state that he did not
have as much access during his studies as me would have liked.
5. Costille received the impression that Helsinki was Alimov's first post
and probably the first time he had been out of the joviet union. He repeated
a number of times during the conversation his fondness for coscow and that he
found Helsinki to be lacking in cultural life. He appeared to be appreciative
for the ride back to the cabassy and upon departing told Costille how much he
enjoyed the afternoon and hoped that they might meet again. about two days
before Christmas LIHOV sent via a Soviet Embassy chauffeur two bottles of soviet
vodka to Cestille's apartment with a New Year's card attached.
6. Nothing further was heard from KLIHOV until 3 March. At this time he
phoned Costille to ask if Costille could obtain two tickets to the premiere of
"Ben Hur" for him and his wife. This was impossible and Costille told him he
would try for tickets at a later date..
7. Mr. Amon REN-YOHANAN, Vice Consul at the Israeli Legation, told Costille
that shortly after the first of the year KLIMOV phoned him and asked him to have
a drink and dinner some evening after work. RN-YOHANAN had also met KLIMOV at
the same Consular Corps function. During the evening ALIHOV told BSN-YOHANAN
that although not Jewish himself, he had a number of Jewish friends in Moscow.
KLIMOV stated that he greatly admired Jewish people for their intellect. The
two had dinner at a local night club, the Klaus Kurki, which caters to young
Finnish girls who come alone on the prowl. BEN-JOHANAN suggested that he and
KLINOV spot two likely prospects and ask them to dance. KLINOV became quite
embarrassed and said that he had rather not as his wife was quite jealous.
B-YOHANAN remarked that his wife would never rind out if KLIKOV just danced
with the girl. However, KLIMOV still refused stating that his wife somehow
could just "feel when he had even danced with another girl,"
8. It will be noted that KLIMOV is listed on the latest Diplomatic Corps
list as an attache. However, he was introduced at the Consular Corps as the
"new Soviet Vice Consul".
