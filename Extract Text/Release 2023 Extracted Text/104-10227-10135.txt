2023 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
17 November 1961
MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, W/6
British Liaison Control Office
SUBJECT: Recent Arrest of Noricidente anticommunist del
Pueblo (MNP) leaders
REFERENCE: 110/2212 dated 3 November 1961
Information available is insufficient to evaluate the Cuban
Ministry of Interior claims that the MNP has been destroyed by the alleged
round-up of a large number of its members and the arrest of Deyrol
(JRCAZF), internal MNP coordinator. Cuban exile have commented that
some of those listed as arrested have actually been held in custody for
five weeks in similar cases to those being pursued by the Cuban
Government in the past. It has been the practice of the Cuban
group to arrest those it thinks likely to turn round to have been
arrested sometime before. In 1960 for example, the coordinator of the ISP
in exile, has transmitted to the press as follows: "arrests have been
carried out recently, but this is by no means a death blow."
There is no doubt that CORALES was under extreme pressure during
the period after his arrest and before his television appearance, which,
according to a Moscow broadcast, was on a carefully edited film,
instead of the usual "live" program presented by the Cuban authorities.
A reliable source of this Agency, who is acquainted
with other captives, and knowledgeable of recent internal resistance activities,
heard the broadcast and accepted that it was definitely CORALES'
voice, and that he fared well with the interrogators and escaped only
people out of reach, i.e., in asylum or exile, or those already in custody
and buoyed hope of saving.
