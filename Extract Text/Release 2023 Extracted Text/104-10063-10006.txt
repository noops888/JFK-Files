Reference paragraphs 23 and 25.
23. The files of this Agency contain Information that during
the week of 20 April 1964 an unidentified American lawyer approached
Dr. Heracrito da Fontoura Sobral Pinto in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,
and asked him to defend the nine Communist Chinese where had been
arrested earlier in the month for espionage and subversive activities.
The nine Chinese were in Brazil as news and trade representatives.
The unidentified American lawyer said that, as an American, n, he could not
defend the Chinese, and, according to Pinto, the American lawyer left
"some dollars" as legal fess and for expenses. The unidentified American
Lawyer was believed to be Victor RABINO ITZ, who arrived in Rio de Janeiro
on 23 April 1964 from Paris accompanied by his wife. The Rio press of
5 December 1964 quoted Sobral Pinto as stating that a telegram was received
from an "international group of lawyers" based in London who were sending
six of its members to observe the final judgment of the Chinese on trial.
This "international group of lawyers" is probably the International
Association of Democratic Lawyers which was founded in 1946, and expeled
from Paris in 1950 by the French Government for its obvious Communist
front activity. The Association moved its headquarters to Brussels,
Belgium. It has close ties with the World Peace Council and other
Communist front organizations. It is quick to denounce actions of the
West and full of praise for Soviet and Chinese actions. It is noted that
on 14 March 1964 Victor RABINOWITZ received a Hungarian visa to travel to
