Dame Fortune keeps popping up

and has taken him.to Mexico, Cuba,
Moscow - and to 'best place of all'
After the war, Dr. Malperin worked with the United Nations
for a couple of years and then joined the faculty of Boston
University where he was involved in the establishment of an
Interdisciplinary department of Latin American studies.
During this period he visited Brazil twice, lecturing at the
University of Sao Paulo and serving as a consultant to the
state government of Sao Paulo. After his second visit, he was
decorated by the Brazilian government with the Order of the
Southern Cross.
It was then that chance Interfered again, this time in a most
malicious way.
"My stay at Boston coincided with the most intense-period
of McCarthyism and this raised problems for a great number
of peerto at the timo. In my own caso, I was given the choice
of co-oporating with the inquisition or, as it turned out, losing
my job.
"Among other disagreeable aspects of co-operating, It
would have turned me into an informer against people who,
as far as I know, had committed no crime. I just couldn't think
of facing my slucents with their knowledge that I was an
Informer."
Leaving Boston University, he went to the National Uni-
versity of Mexico City where he remained for six years. While
working there, he did some consulting work for the Mexican
Government, thereby gaining further practical experience
on the problems of underdevelopment in Latin America.
This experience led directly to his next position - a three-
year appointment at the Academy of Sciences in Moscow.
Halperin expiains:
"At that time, the period when Kruschev was trying to
loosen up some of the rigid controls of Stalin's dictatorship,
thore was a desire at the Academy to have some western
expertise on Latin American, developmental problems. In
other words, my Mexican experience was a direct prerequl-
sile for the Moscow Invitation.
"It's strange how, in retrospect, what seemed to be a
rather difficult choice in 1953 turned out to be very lucky.
You never know. Something happens that can crush you or,
on the contrary, can make you healthier and more robust
than you've ever been before.
"And, when the invitation came from Moscow, I was foot-
loose and free. My status in Me.. was always that of a
visiting professor, so I had no prob.
of security - tenure
or pension, for example to tie im town. when it came. I
had nothing to lose and everything to gain."
Dr. Halpurin spent three years at the Academy and found
It to bo en extraordinary experience. "I wasn't there as a
tourist; neither was 1. there as an outside researcher. I. was
actually in the machine, with no permanent ties to it. I was
working in the factory, rather than just studying it."
Foto enco again intervened in his life, this tirne in the form
of the celebrated Latin American guerrilla leader, Che
Guevara.
Late one night, there was a knock on my door and l
opened it and there stood Che with a couple of his Cuban
friends. He had been told about me by mutual friends in
Mexico and they suggested that, in view of the need for
competent educators and social scientists in Cuba, I might
be interested in accepting an invitation to teach at the Uni-
versity of Havana."
As it happened, Dr. Halperin wes interested. He spent the
next six years in Cuba, and after leaving, produced a book
on the country - The Rise and Decline of Fidel Castro: Ar
Essay in Contemporary History. It was pubished by ine Uni-
versity of California Press and a second edition, in paper-
back, has recently appeared. (Incidentally, Cr. Halperin's
published work spans 45 years and "several (housand
pages.")
As with the Moscow appointment, it was the fact that he:
was freed of concerns about job secunty, since he had none
which allowed him to accept Guevara's offer.
Although Cuba was "A very pleasant country," Dr. Hal-
perin found life there to be somewhat disconcerting since.
"as a highly-paid foreign expert, I lived hich oft the hog and
didn't share the austerity of the rest of the country.
"And It was troubling, you know, when neighbors would
krock on our door to see if we could spare a thimblelul of
salt or a tablespoon of cooking oil and there we were, sitting
with everything at our disposal"
And a further quirk of fate, naturally, brought him to Simon
Fraser in 1968.. He'd met a Canadian while in Havana and one
dey, about a year later, ha received a phone call from a niace
called Burnaby." It was the same Canadian, imiting him to
participate in a seminer on Latin America, with "all expenses
paid."
When ho received the invitation, in the spring of 1968, he
had already resigned his position in Havena and was planning
to return to the United States the following September.
"When the Invitation came, I thought. 'Two weeks? Why not?",
so I accepted and came up here and, like the man who came
to dinner, they couldn't get rid of me.
"I never dreamed I would end up in Canada, Three-quarters
of a century after my father left it, but I now feel thoroughly
assimilated to the Canadien environment." In fact, he's so well
assimilated that he is now listed in the Canadian edition of
Who's Who.
Ouring his well-travelled life, Dr. Halperin has had the oppor-
tunity to teach at a number of reputable mstitutens in North
America, Europe and Latin America but he says that he's
"never been in a more congenial place than Simon Frat,
never in my life.
"It's the best place, all in all, that I've ever do... Students
and faculty have it very good here and I'm not only
about the splendid scenery and the mild chimate. P-
ties for learning, teaching, research and recrea-
steady customer at the swimming pool הרב
know are magnificent."
