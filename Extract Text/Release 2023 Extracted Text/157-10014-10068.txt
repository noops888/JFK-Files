from CIA Headquarters having co go to the Congo to provide the
Chief of Station in the Congo with instructions to carry out
the assassination of Lumumba if possible, and also provide him
with the tools to carry out such an assassination, namely
poisons and medical equipment for administering them?"
You said, "No, I do not."
Later on in your testimony of that. sama session when you
were asked your opinion as to the truth of testimony we had
received from Dr. Gottlieb excuse me, from the Chief of
Station, who was in Leopoldville at that time, about a visit
that he received from Dr. Gottlieb, where the Chief of Stationr
testified that he received poison and instructions from (Dr.
Gottlieb, when asked your opinion about the truth about the
testimony of the Chief of Station, you responded that "There
is nothing in my experience with the Agency that would really
bear on that point whatsoever." And that was at page 39 in
your transcript.
Have your answers to those two questions changed in light
of your review of the documents today?
Mr. Tweady. I have not had a chance to read the transcript

There seems:

3 there is no question in reading the documents that I read this
4
morning, which I had not seen in the better part of fifteen

with material which you mentioned and had a discussion along
these lines with the Chief of Station.

He did not, however, go out with instructions to the Chief

about assassinating Lumumba.
Mr. Baron. In your answers that we have just reviewed in
your first examination, you indicated that you had no knowledus

on the question whether such a mission was undertaken or what
the character of it was.
Has the review of the documents today refreshed your
recollection to some substantial degree?
Mr. Tweedy. What I was certainly trying to say the first
time, and I repeat it, I said I had no recollection of fir
Gottlieb going to the Congo, but if the Chief of Station said
24
25
he was there, I was perfectly prepared to believe the Chief of
Station:.
I have now reviewed these documents. I recall the circum-
stances in which these things occurred, and there's no question

that Dr. Gottlieb went to the Congo.

I was merely telling you, at that time, what I could
remember, and there was an awful lot that I did not and do not.
Mr. Baron. To move to the period when you were Chief of
5

the Africa Division and Richard Bissell was DDP in the summer
of 1960, did you have conversations with Richard Bissell where
the subject of the assassination of Lumumba arosa?
8
Mr. Tweedy. Yes, I did. In fact, the first conversation,

as I recall it, that I ever had on the subject was one he
initiated with me, and, as I think I told you, I do not recall
exactly what was said, but there was no question about it but
what Mr. Bissell was saying to me was that there was agreement.
policy agreement in Washington, that Lumumba must be removed
from the position of control and influence in the Congo or that
the Congo was going to be in serious trouble and thus Africa,
10 at that stage of its development; and that among the possibil-
ities of that elimination was indeed assassination.
In terms of the detail of that conversation with Mr. Bissell.
I really cannot go any further than that. This certainly was
the gist of it.
Mr. Baror.. Was Mr. Bissell any more specific at any point
with you about the policy level where the consideration to
assassinate Lumumba had been made?
Mr. Tweedy. No, sir. The most authoritative statement 0:
that was a cable that want out to the field from the Director,

Mr. Dulles, which implied to me there was policy agreement in
Washington. When I say policy agreement in Washington, I cannot
be more specific because I never knew any more specificity.
4
However, it was perfectly clear that the Agency felt that it
5

7
had some sort of policy consensus in Washington about the need
for the removal of Lumumba. When I say removal, I mean by
whatever means; this does not necessarily have to be confined
8
to assassination, a political way of doing it, or anything
elas.

Mr. Baron.
It did not exclude assassination?

No, indeed it did not.

even tell you. On instructions, I might even have drafted it,

Mr. Baron. In your talks with Mr. Bissell, where the

to you that the subject had been opened at very high levels

to asking you to proceed to explore means to getting access to
Lumumba for the purpose of assassinating him?
Mr. Tweedy. The purpose of his conversation with me was
to initiate correspondence with the Station for them to explore
with Headquarters the possibility of this, that is assassina-
tion, or indeed any other means of removing Lumumba trom power.
In other words, the purpose of the exercise was to tell the
Station what Headquarters had in mind, diving it some idea of
the policy background of it, and then to have the Station
start reviewing possibilities, assets, and discussing them with
Headquarters in detail in the same way that we would with any
operation, whether it was as sensitive as this, or les550.
It was, in other words, the initiation of quite normal
operational dialogue between Headquarters and the field, apart
from the fact that it was an unusual subject.
Mr. Baron. At some point after the series of conversations
with Richard Bissell, did you have a conversation with Sidney
Gottlieb about a mission that he was to undertake in the
Congo?

Mr. Baron. Turning to Tab 6 of the Senator's books, I'm
referring to a cable we reviewed this morning issued on
September 27th by the Chief of Station and sent to you, Eyes
Only, at the CIA Headquarters where the Chief of Station indi-
cates that he contacted Gottlieb on the 26th of September and
they were on the same wavelength.
Mr. Tweedy. Which one is this?
Mr. Baron. This should be marked number 6.
Mr. Tweady. Oh, yes, excuse me.
Mr. Baron. It begins, "Iden Ref contacted 26 September."
In this cable, the Chief of Station indicates that he had had
been
two talks with Dr. Gottlieb. He and Dr. Gottlieb had and Dr.
considering a list of possibilities as follows.
In paragraph 3 at the bottom of the next page, the Chief
of Station says, "Plan proceed on basis priority as listed
abcve unless instructed to contrary."
And paragraph A on the first page was Chief of Station's
top priority plan which related to recalling a certain agent
from Stanleyville and having him take refuge with Big Brother.
The coble continues, "would thus act as inside man to brush us
details to razor edge."

this out.
Mr. Baron. He was to continue, in your mind, at least up

7
until the point where he had determined there was a feasible
means of assassinating Lumumba?
Would that be correct?
Mr. Tweedy. I would put it more broadly than that. I
would say that he was to continue to explore it to determine
whether or not there was a feasible means. He perfectly well
could come to the conclusion that with the hardest work in the
world that he could see no way to do it. That would have been
a perfectly acceptable conclusion to Headquarters, because a
decision would have to be made professionally.
Mr. Baron. Turning to Tab 12 of the Senator's books, there
is a cable that you sent in this Eyes Only channel to the Chief
of Station on October 15th, which is the week after Dr. Gottlieb
had left the Congo. In this cable, you are saying, you are
referring first of all to another cable sent on the same day
that was not sent through the Eyes Only channel, and then
reassuring this Chief of Station that WIRCAK, which is a

What did you mean by disposition spontaneously?
Mr. Tweedy. The English of that cable, as I mentioned
this morning, is absolutely appalling.

Mr. Baron. I have no further questions at this point.

(Whereupon, Senator Church left the hearing room.)
Senator Goldwater. Mr. Tweedy, how long did you serve
with the CIA?
Mr. Tweedy. I started with CIG on the 1st of May, 1947 and
served until March, 1973.
Senator Goldwater. You have had experience with intelli-
gence gathering agencies all around the world, I assume, or
most of them?
Mr. Tweedy. A considerable number, yes, sir.
Senator Goldwater. Is it common practice in intelligence
agencies such as the CIA for a lot of people to know about
everything that is going on, or am I right in assuming that
there are many things that you do in the intelligence field,
particularly the covert field, that the man sitting next to you
may know nothing about. Is that correct?
Compartmentation was
Mr. Tweedy. That is correct, sir.
There were a great many things going on that

I never knew anything about and do not know to this day.
Senator Goldwater. Is that not in your experience the
most successful form of intelligence gathering? Is that the
British practice?
Mr. Tweedy. The only way that you can run an intelligenc
organization, in my view, is internally.
You have baan with the CIA actually

Mr. Tweedy. I came away from a career in intelligence in
March of '73 with rather strong convictions. I might preface
my remarks here in answer to your question, Sanator, by saying
I was in intelligence during the War, I was in Naval Intelli-
gence. This was not OSS, but I was in intelligence. It also
determined me, if the circumstances permitted, to make a
career of intelligence after the War, and after the difficulty
of making the right contacts and so on and so forth, eventuall
it worked and I spent a career in CIA.
I have two very strong impressions of that experience.
One of them has to do with my colleagues, the personnel of the
18. Agency, who I found to be a remarkably talented group. The

Senator Goldwater. Are you still close to the members of
the CIA, your old friends?
Mr. Tweedy. Obviously I have a great many friends who are
still serving. This is increasingly not the case as retirements
are catching up with my colleagues, but I do keep abreast of
Agency affairs to the extent I can. I do not attempt to inter-
fare with them. At their request, I did a consultation job in
