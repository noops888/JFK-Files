Correct.
Mr. Baron. Were you an employee of the CIA during that

Mr. Baron. I would like to ask you some questions about
a series of events that occurred in 1961, simply to find out
whether you have any recollection of any of the names of
9
people involved or the activities involved that you may have
10 garnered either from personal contact with these people or
from subsequent review of the files involved.

First of all, in 1961, we have a record from the IG Report
of a meeting between Jack Stuart who was a CIA officer at that
time and a Cuban who we have agreed to refer to as AMLASH for
the purposes of this session today.

Our understanding is that a meeting was arranged by
Carlos Tepedino, who was known as AMWHIP, who served as an
intermediary between AMLASH and Stuart, and that the meeting
took place in Mexico City to discuss the possibility that
AMLASH might cooperate either with CIA strike that
to
discuss AMLASH's views on the Cuban situation generally.
Do you have any recollection from any source of initial
contacts between Jack Stuart and AMLASH?
AMLASH Case Officer.

Only the general recollection that
he was contacted about the time that you said he was, but no

Mr. Baron. Do you have any knowledge from any source

about the source of the initiative for these first contacts
between AMLASH and the CIA?
5
AMLASH Case Officer. No, I don't.
6
7
Mr. Baron. You are not aware of the CIA having taken the
initiative in this instance as opposed to AMLASH?
8
AMLASH Case Officer.
Specifically, no. I don't know who
9
10
took the initiative.
Mr. Baron. Did you ever discuss these meetings with Jack
11
Stuart personally?
12
AMLASH Case Officer. No, I didn't.
13
Mr. Baron. Have you ever met Jack Stuart?
14
AMLASH Case Officer.
Yes, I have.
Mr. Baron.
15
Did you meet Jack Stuart during the period
16
between 1963 and 1965 when you were involved with Cuban affairs?
AMLASH Case Officer.
17
Not that I can recollect.
Mr. Baron.
18
Do you recall in what connection you dealt
19
with Jack Stuart?
AMLASH Case Officer.
20.
As a colleague in the Agency, but
21
not specifically on this operation.
Mr. Baron.
22
Have you ever met Carlos Tepedino, who was
23
known as agent AMWHIP?
AMLASH Case Officer.
24
Yes, I have.
25
Mr. Baron. And did you work with Mr. Tepedino specifically

on the AMLASH Project during the time of your involvement in
the AMLASH Project?
AMLASH Case Officer. Not specifically, because he was
used before to serve as the contact and the interpreter, and I
didn't need an interpreter to work with AMLASH, so although I
knew him and I knew of him, he was not involved directly with
me in my contacts with AMLASH.
Mr. Baron. Did you meet directly with Carlos Tepedino?
AMLASH Case Officer. I know him, yes, or I knew him.
Mr. Baron. Although he wasn't serving as an interpreter
during the course of this operation, was he serving as an
intermediary between yourself and AMLASH?
AMLASH Case Officer. He was in contact with AMLASH. He
was a very close friend of AMLASH. He had served as an
intermediary, but during the time I was in contact, he did not
serve as the intermediary. In other words, I contacted him
directly. I contacted AMLASH directly.
Mr. Baron. And what role did Carlos Tepedino play during
the period of your involvement with AMLASH?
AMLASH Case Officer. As a friend of AMLASH. He knew what
AMLASH was proposing.
Mr. Baron. And would sometimes discuss AMLASH's proposals
with you in AMLASH's absence?
AMLASH Case Officer. I cannot recall any specific term
or any specific subject that we would have discussed, but I

Mr. Rhea.
Did William Harvey ever speak to you of the
use of gambling syndicate contacts in Cuba for any operation
whatsoever?
AMLASH Case Officer. No, he didn't.
Mr. Baron. Did you ever hear, during the period of
'60 to '66 of any mention of the use of poison pills against
Fidel Castro?
AMLASH Case Officer. No, I didn't.
Mr. Baron. Did you ever hear about the development of
poison pills at the CIA?
AMLASH Case Officer. No.

as I recall it. It was a project for the recruitment of
intelligence sources inside Cuba, primary military sources, as
I recall the cryptonym.
Mr. Baron. Was that the cryptonym from the asset
spotting project that you were working on with William Harvey?
AMLASH Case Officer. I don't remember if it was at the
time that William Harvey was there or afterwards, I don't
recall the time period, but it was the overall operation for
the recruitment of sources inside Cuba.
Mr. Baron. Did you continue working on this asset spotting

AMLASH?
3
AMLASH Case Officer. Yes, I did.
4
5
Mr. Baron. And at some point that project came to be
known as AMHAPRON?

AMLASH Case Officer.
Yes, but I don't remember exactly

when that cryptonym was given to the project.

Mr. Baron. Was removal of key military leaders around
Castro ever a part of MHAPRON?
AMLASH Case Officer. To the best of my recollection, no.
Mr. Baron. Who was the man in charge of Project MBAPRON?
AMLASH Case Officer. I was, at a time.
Mr. Baron. You would have been called Project Director
or case officer?
AMLASH Case Officer. I was the case officer, yes.
Mr. Baron. Were any of the assets for the MHAPRON Project
also assets for Project AMLASH?
AMLASH Case Officer. They were not conceived that way,
but one or two of them crossed.
Mr. Baron.
20.
To your knowledge, were any of the assets in
21
22
MHAPRON who were not assets for Project AMLASH ever involved
in any kind of program of direct personal action against
Castro?
23
24
AMLASH Case Officer. No, they were not.

Mr. Baron. When you reported on Project MHAPRON to whom

AMLASH Case Officer.
Right.
Mr. Baron. Were you aware of FitzGerald's reporting to
anyone above him on MILAPRON?
AMLASH Case Officer. I assume that he did, but I did not
accompany him to any of the meetings.
Mr. Baron. Would you assume that he reported to Richard
10
11
Bissell on I'm sorry. Would you assume that he reported to
Richard Helms on Project MHAPRON?
12
AMLASH Case Officer.
That would be the chain of command,
13
14
15
16
17
the chain of reporting, but I am not aware of what he reported
to Helms or anybody.
Mr. Baron. And do you have any direct knowledge of any
reporting FitzGerald may have done on MHAPRON to the Special
Group?
18
AMLASH Case Officer. No, I don't.
19
20
21
22
Mr. Baron. Okay.
Do you have any recollection of a trip that Agent AMLASH
took to Helsinki in June of 1962?
AMLASH Case Officer. No details. I knew he had made
23
that trip.
24
Mr. Baron. But you were never involved during that period
25
of time with Project AMLASH?

5
Mr. Baron. Do you have any recollection of contact

between the CIA and the FBI with respect to Project AMLASH?
7
AMLASH Case Officer.
No, I don't.

Mr. Baron. Were you
ever made aware of a report that

the FBI forwarded to the CIA about a meeting held between
Carlos Tepedinotand the FBI?
AMLASH Case Officer. No, I wasn't.
Mr. Baron. Do you have any recollection at all of
dissatisfaction expressed by Carlos Tepedino about the lack of
vigor with which the CIA was approaching the defection of
AMLASH?
AMLASH Case Officer. This was part of the record, of the
AMLASH record, but I had nothing to do with that, and I was
not involved in the operation at that time.
19
20
21
Mr. Baron. When you took over Project AMLASH, was it a
concern of yours to demonstrate to Agent AMLASH that the CIA
would be vigorous in supporting his actions?
22
23
24
AMLASH Case Officer. The primary objective, when I took
over the contact with AMLASH was to keep him in place and
convince him to return to Cuba and not to permit him to defect
25
and stay away from the island.

August 1st of 1962 that he held with AMLASH in Helsinki?
AMLASH Case Officer. I know that such a contact report
was in the file, but I was not associated with the operation
in '62.
Mr. Baron. Let me show you this, it is a copy of an
excerpt from that report, as it appears in the IG Report of
1967, and ask you if that refreshes your recollection in any
way?
And for the record, let us mark this AMLASH Exhibit 1.

Mr. Baron. Have you had a chance to read it through?
2
AMLASH Case Officer. Yes.
3
Mr. Baron. Having looked at this document, do you have
4
5
any further recollection of ever seeing this document, or
discussing the meeting directly with Wainwright??
6
AMLASH Case Officer. I probably discussed the meeting
7
8
with Wainwright.
I don't recall discussing these specific
items. I do recall that there was a contact report in the
9
10
files. Whether this was the specific one that I recall seeing
in the files, I could not attest to, but certainly it was a
11
practice to write contact reports.
12
Mr. Baron. Who was William Wainwright?
13
AMLASH Case Officer. He was the case officer who, with
14
Tepedino met with AMLASH before I took over the contact with
15
AMLASH.
16
Mr. Baron. So he had the same position that you did in
17
connection with Project AMLASH and was your predecessor?
18
AMLASH Case Officer. He was my predecessor, as far as
19
the contact was concerned, yes.

25
AMLASH Case Officer. No, he was under SAS.
Mr. Baron. Was there anyone else who was a predecessor
to you in any other sense?
AMLASH Case Officer. Not that I recall.
Mr. Rhea. Before you took over Project AMLASH, what

Mr. Rhea. He was under SAS.

5
Mr. Baron. Which was under FitzGerald who in turn was
under the DDP Helms, is that correct?
6
AMLASH Case Officer.
That's correct.
7
Mr. Baron. After you took over from Wainwright did he
8
continue to be involved in Project AMLASH in any way?
9
10
11
AMLASH Case Officer. No, not after the first meeting.
Mr. Baron. He moved on to a different assignment then?
AMLASH Case Officer. Yes.
12
13
14
Mr. Baron. Directing your attention back to this contact,
or this excerpt from a contact report, I realize that you don't
have a direct recollection of seeing this contact report
15
16
17
here where it says "He"
18
19
20
21
except for glancing at it in the files, but do you recall ever
discussing with Wainwright the excerpt in the fourth paragraph
"also wanted
to plan the execution of Carlos Rodriquez (a topranking Castro
subordinate) and the Soviet Ambassador, and also to eliminate
Fidel, by execution if necessary."
And then it continues, in the next paragraph, "While we

were making no commitments or plans, we pointed out to AMLASH
that schemes like he envisioned certainly took place, but that

2
Did you ever discuss this kind of desire to eliminate

Fidel Castro and others on the part of AMLASH?

Mr. Baron. Did you have general briefing sessions with
Wainwright when you took over from him as case officer on the
project?
AMLASH Case Officer.
Yes.
Mr. Baron. Was it in the course of his briefing sessions
that you generally discussed the subject that is referred to
here, the subject of AMLASH's desire to eliminate Castro by
execution if necessary?
AMLASH Case Officer. If this was mentioned, it was a very
small portion of the discussion about AMLASH. My primary
interest at that time in my discussions with Wainwright is to
find out who specifically
(Whereupon,
Senator Morgan entered the hearing room.)
Mr. Baron. Let's go off the record a minute.

Senator Morgan. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony
you have given today will be the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

Mr. Baron. And you understand that your rights are still

if you wish, the right to stop at any point and ask for

discussed, and these rights are still intact?
11
(Discussion off the record.)
12
13
14
15
16
17
Mr. Baron. Now we were just discussing general briefing
sessions that you may have had with William Wainwright when
you took over for him as case officer for the AMLASH operation
and you say that you do not have a specific recollection of
Wainwright telling you that AMLASH was intent on eliminating
Castro by execution if necessary, is that correct?
18
AMLASH Case Officer. That is correct.
19
20
21
Mr. Baron. Is it possible that you generally discussed
AMLASH's desire to get rid of Castro with Wainwright during
your briefing sessions?
22
AMLASH Case Officer. In general this was mentioned, because
23
24
this was seen by AMLASH at that time as one of the means of
reversing the government in Cuba.
25
Mr. Baron.
Presumably, if Wainwright was aware, as he
NW 50955 DocId: 32203893 Page 13
TOP SECRET
28
TOP SECRET
29
1
indicates in this report of the strength of AMLASH's desire
2
to get rid of Castro by execution if necessary, he would have
conveyed that to you in some way, isn't that correct?
3
4
AMLASH Case Officer.
Yes, but you also must recognize
5
that AMLASH was a rather temperamental man whose temperament
6
7
8
was of a mercurical nature and whereas he may have said something
like this in one fit of pique, he would settle down and talk
about organizing a regular military coup in the next breath.
9
10
11
Mr. Baron. At the time that you took over Project AMLASH,
did Wainwright tell you that a specifio means of overthrowing
Castro had been chosen?
12
13
14
15
16
17
AMLASH Case Officer. No.
Mr. Baron. Then in this document when he says that "We
were making no commitments or plans" and then it goes on to
say that he wanted to make sure that AMLASH understood that
"coordination, planning, information, collection, et cetera,
were necessary prerequisites to insure the value and success
of such plans" what plans would he have been referring to there?
AMLASH Case Officer. I don't know. It was true that
18
19
20
21
22
there was certainly no plans that I know of which would refer
to the elimination of Rodriquez, Fidel or the Soviet Ambassador,
general plans for the coup, for a military coup, maybe this was
23
what he was talking about. I wouldn't know, I don't know
24
what he was I wasn't there at the time and I don't know
25
specifically what he was talking about.

Mr. Baron. Let's move on, then, to a few days later in
2 August of 1962; between the 10th and the 11th of August of
3
1962, Wainwright, Carlos Tepedinoland AMLASH apparently met
4
in Copenhagen for further meetings. Do you have any recollection
5
of being informed by Wainwright of those meetings?
6
AMLASH Case Officer.
No, just on the general subject
7
that they had met, but not on any specifics.
8
Mr. Baron. Do you have any recollection of learning from
9
any source that during the meetings in Copenhagen, assassination
10
was discussed between Wainwright and AMLASH?
11
AMLASH Case Officer. As a plan?
12
Mr. Baron. Discussed in any sense.
13
AMLASH Case Officer.
I don't know. I mean, it may have
14
been, but I don't know if it was specificially discussed by
him.
15
16
But I do not recollect that Wainwright for anybody told
me that in Copenhagen assassination was discussed.
17
Mr. Kelley. Did Wainwright ever say to you that you should
18
19
not use the word assassinate with AMLASH. for any reason in
particular because AMLASH objected to the use of that word?
AMLASH Case Officer. Yes.
20
I recall Wainwright stating
21
that AMLASH did not like to talk specifically about assassina-
tion.
22
Mr. Baron.
23
Did you recall any time in your association
24
with AMLASH when he became upset when that word might arise
in conversation?
25
NW 50955 DocId: 32203893 Page 15
TOP SECRET
30
TOP SECRET
31
1
AMLASH Case Officer. I don't recall that he specifically

3
used that word. He would use such words as "neutralization,"
but not specifically "assassination."
4
Mr. Baron. And when he would use a word like neutraliza-
5 tion, he would be referring to assassination, is that a fair

We were talking
AMLASH Case Officer. Well, yes and no.
about the removal from power of Castro, which could mean
assassination, but could also mean just physically remove him
without killing him.
Mr. Baron. Let me show you for a moment an excerpt from
a contact report written by Wainwright about his meetings on
August 10th and 11th, 1962. He refers in this excerpt for the
record to the fact that they were "discussing various aspects
of AMLASH's future role in Cuba." And he says, "we used the
term assassinate, which was most objectionable to AMLASH and
he became visibly upset."
And then he goes on to say, "It was not the act he
objected to but merely the choice of the word used to describe
Eliminate was acceptable."

Does that fit with your understanding of the way AMLASH
related to the concept of assassination and the use of the
word assassination?
AMLASH Case Officer. Generally speaking yes, because we
never
I certainly never raised the subject of assassination

33
1
Mr. Baron. Does this description by Wainwright of the
2
fact that AMLASH would not object to the act of assassination
3
but rather to the word, fit with your understanding of
4
5
AMLASH's character? That he would have no particular objection
to contemplating assassination?
6
7
AMLASH Case Officer. That is difficult for me to say
because as I say, we never discussed this subject in that
8
detail.
9
Mr. Baron. Did he ever use the term eliminate Castro
10
to you to the best of your recollection?
11
AMLASH Case Officer.
I recall the word neutralize more
12
than eliminate.
Mr. Baron.
13
Would you assume that they would have meant
14
the same thing?
15
AMLASH Case Officer. Yes, vaguely, I guess. It would
16
probably mean the same thing.
Mr. Baron.
17
And that they could be fairly interepreted
18
in this context as a euphemism that AMLASH might use, because
he was uncomfortable with the word assassination?
19
AMLASH Case Officer. It could be.
20.
I mean, I could not
21
state specifically whether he was using it because he ws
uncomfortable with the word assassination, or because he was
22
uncomfortable with the act itself. This is difficult for
23
me to clarify for you.
24
25
Mr. Baron. All right.

Did you ever learn of a meeting later in August between

Only in general terms.
5
Mr. Baron. Did you know Earl Williamson?

Mr. Baron. Did you come to know Carl Williamson during

the course of your association with Project AMLASH?

Mr. Baron. Were you aware of the fact that AMLASH was

file.
Mr. Baron. And what is your recollection?
AMLASH Case Officer. I don't recall if it was training
or if it was a demonstration in explosives, but no more than
that.
Mr. Baron. Why would he be given this kind of training?
AMLASH Case Officer. I don't know.
Mr. Baron. Wouldn't this kind of training be for the
purpose of operations that he might perform inside Cuba?
AMLASH Case Officer. I do not specifically know if there
were any plans for such operations.
If such
Mr. Baron. I'm not asking right now if there were plans
or not, but simply what the purpose of the training would have

been?
2
AMLASH Case Officer. I don't know.
3
Mr. Baron. To create the capability to perform such

operations.
5
Is that a fair way to put it?
AMLASH Case Officer. It would appear that that's what it

would be, but I don't know that those were the plans.
Mr. Baron. And were you aware of any S/W training that
8
was given to AMLASH?
9
AMLASH Case Officer. Only from having heard that he was
10
given S/W training.
11
Mr. Baron. And is that secret writing training?

In order for him to be able to communicate off-island, if
he returned.
Mr. Baron. Do you have any recollection of a cable that
Farl Williamson sent to CIA Headquarters on August 17 which
indicated that AMLASH might try to carry out an assassination
attempt on his own initiative?
AMLASH Case Officer. I do not have any recollection at that
time. Reading the file afterwards, I know a cable was sent.
Specifically what it said, I do not recall.
22
Mr. Baron.
But you do remember that a cable was sent to
23
the effect that AMLASH might try a physical elimination mission
24
against Castro on his own?
25
AMLASH Case Officer.
No, I do not specifically remember

that.
2
Mr. Baron. What do you recollect about the cable?
3
AMLASH Case Officer. The one of the fact that he had been

given the explosives training, or the demonstration in explosives,
but specifically that it mentioned assassination, I do not

recall.
Mr. Baron. Let me draw your attention now to a document
we will mark AMLASH 3, which is a one sentence excerpt from a
cable from Earl Williamson, who was a case officer of the CIA,
to CIA Headquarters, cabled on August 17, 1962.

(The document referred

to was marked AMLASH
Exhibit No. 3 for

Mr. Baron. Were you ever briefed by Wainwright or anyone
else on the fact that the CIA was aware that AMLASH could or
might try to carry out on his own initiative a physical
elimination mission against Castro?
AMLASH Case Officer. It was mentioned to me, but only in
the most general terms, not in any specific plan that he had to
do it.
Mr. Baron. And what kind of general terms would it have
been that he would do it?
AMLASH Case Officer. Primarily, as I recall, in the terms
of his the fact that he did not like to use the term assass-
ination.
Again, getting back to what I mentioned before in the
terms of elimination or neutralization of the leadership, but
not specifically of an assassination, a specific assassination
attempt against Castro. It was in those general terms that I
recall it, not in specific terms.

Mr. Baron. In looking at this cable, however, would you
agree that the physical elimination mission that is referred
to there where it says "Have no intention give AMLASH physical
elimination mission" is probably an assassination attempt
25 against Castro? In other words, Williamson is saying I have no

Mr. Baron. Do you remember if Carlos Tepedino was also

present?

AMLASH Case Officer. Tepedinopalso went on that trip, yes.

Mr. Baron. And what was the purpose of that trip?
8
AMLASH Case Officer. To introduce AMLASH to me as a

Spanish-speaking case officer.

Mr. Baron. Do you recall any specific discussions you
