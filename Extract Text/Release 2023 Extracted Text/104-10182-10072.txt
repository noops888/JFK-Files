THE AGENCY HAVE ANY OPERATIONAL INTEREST IN HIM. WERBELL WAS A
COMMISSIONED OFFICER WITH THE OSS DURING WORLD WAR II AND SERVED IN
THE CHINA-BURMA-INDIA THEATRE. IN AUGUST OF 1959, THIS AGENCY AR
CONSIDERED USING WERBELL AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION ON REVOLUTIONARY
ACTIVITIES IN THE CARIBBEAN AREA, PARTICULARLY CUBA, BUT TERMINATED
ITS CONSIDERATION OF HIS POSSIBLE USE IN OCTOBER 19598 WHEN IT WAS
DETERMINED THAT HIS INFORMATION WAS OF LITTLE VALUE AND IT WAS
SUSPECTED THAT HE WOULD USE THE PROPOSED CONNECTION WITH THE AGENCY TO
HIS
PROMOTE PERSONAL INTERESTS. Y
3. DURING AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER 1962 REPORTING ON WERBELL REVEALED
THAT HE VISITED SEVERAL CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES AND APPEARED TO BE
CONTACTING OFFICIALS OF THE GOVERNMENTS OF GUATEMALA, NICARAGUA AND

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations
ATTENTION..
Associate Deputy Director for Operations
FROM
: Walter T. Lloyd
Associate General Counsel
SUBJECT
: Mitchell Livingston Werbell, III

1. As you are aware, on the instruction of United States
District Judge Peter Fay (Miami, Florida Division), incident to
the Drug Enforcement Administration's prosecution of Subject
for conspiracy to import and distribute multi-ton loads of
marijuana, the undersigned made a detailed review of the files
of this Agency concerning Subject in August 1976. This exami-
nation was to ascertain any data that ran to Werbell's guilt or
innocence of the offense charged and any other data reflecting the
nature of the relationship between Werbell and the U.S. Government..
This latter requirement was grounded on the Court's view that
Werbell's voluntary reporting to the Agency and any government
condonation of his activities might be exculpatory in the eyes of the
jury.

2. In response, we reviewed the files, identified Agency
contacts with Subject and prepared two affidavits: one regarding
non-employment by Mr. B. DeFelice and the second regarding
Werbell's relationship to the Agency by the undersigned. Copies
are attached. During the trial the first affidavit was shown to
counsel for Werbell by DEA counsel, Mr. Sam Sheres, at which
point defendant's counsel stipulated that Werbell was never a
forma! employee of the Central Intelligence Agency. Sheres
subsequently returned the affidavits to the undersigned at the
conclusion of the trial.

3. Regarding the relationship of Werbell to the Agency, as
approved by the Deputy Director, the undersigned appeared before
Judge Fay in his chambers on 31 August and under oath answered
questions of the Court concerning Werbell. A copy of the transcript
• of that proceeding is attached. You will note that judge Fay requested
that all pertinent government records be made available to the Court
for its inspection. Accordingly, copies of Agency files were reproduced.
culled for "Brady-type" documents, excised to protect sources and
methods under the "SWP case criteria" and reviewed and approved by
Assistant DD/O on the evening of 1 September. These processed
documents were then handcarried to Miami by the undersigned on
2 September.

4. The undersigned advised Judge Fay at 0830 hours on
2 September that I had in my possession copies of all of the Agency
files on Werbell, had culled them as to possible "Brady" documents
and was prepared to review them with the Judge at his convenience.
He was on the bench with a tight schedule and asked that the possible
Brady documents first be reviewed by Karen Atkinson, the principal
counsel for the prosecution. The undersigned subsequently briefed
Atkinson on the nature of data in the possible Brady documents. This
resulted in a significant reduction in the number of possibles. The
undersigned gave Atkinson copies of the four unclassified OGC
documents related to the DOD revocation of Werbell's security clearance
in 1971. In addition, Office of Security documents edited and approved
for release to Werbell under his Freedom of Information and Privacy
Act request (Tabs Armand B of OS response), consisting of media
publications and security investigative data, were also provided
Atkinson. Due to counsel for Werbell raising an issue on Werbell's
use of a boat named "Venus" belonging to CIA, a declassified copy
of the OS short investigative report outlining data concerning Werbell's
use of the Venus to transport arms was also provided Atkinson. The
related OS Headquarters assignment document was not provided.
Related DDO documents on the ownership of Venus by the "JURE"
Cuban group were mentioned to Atkinson but not made available.

5. While the above documents were provided the Department of
Justice with the understanding they could be passed to Counsel for
Werbell due to subsequent events noted below, it is not certain that
this occurred. Specifically, the undersigned declined to release
additional "Brady" documents without consultation and instructions
:
CONFIDE....AL

from the Court. The requested meeting was put off by Judge Fay and
defendante subsequently rested their case. The DOJ had little else
to add and the case went to the jury about noon on 3 September. All
the remaining copies of Agency documents were returned to Headquarters
by the undersigned the evening of 3 September. On 4 September the
jury returned a verdict of "not guilty." As a result, the bulk of
"Brady-type" Agency documents or Werbell was not provided to
counsel for Werbell and Judge Fay reviewed no Agency documents.
It should be noted all copies of documents taken to Miami were excised
in accord with the "SWP case criteria" and on return to Headquarters,
these were destroyed by the undersigned.

6. As a related matter, on 16 November Mr. Arthur Egbert
of the Interna! Security Division of the DEA contacted the undersigned
seeking background information on Werbell. The undersigned suggested.
Egbert first review the files of the FBI on Werbell as most of the data
we have is contained in FBI reports. Should FBI data be insufficient.
for his needs I-süggested he seek access to our files in DDO and Office
of Security via the normal DEA Department of Justice liaison channels.

SUBJECT
: Mitchell Livingston Werbel III

1. I was advised by the Justice Department on 23 February that
Werbel has been indicted and the trial is scheduled to begin on 29 March
in Miami, Florida. The charges relate to importing and distributing
quantities of marijuana. With Werbel's propensity to raise his past
affiliations with the Agency, we can anticipate problems during this trial.
An additional problem is presented because Werbel is defended by Edwin
Marger who was the defense attorney for John Hawk in the B-26 case in
Buffalo, New York in 1966. It was Edwin Marger who subpoenaed the CIA
General Counsel as a defense witness.

2. The Justice Department has received information that a person
either currently or formerly affiliated with the CIA has been participating
in Werbel's meetings with his attorney. It would be appreciated if all
addressees could review their holdings on Werbel and determine if there
is any validity to any recent contacts with him. I would urge that instruc-
tions be sent to Miami that no, repeat no, contact with Werbel take place
between now and the beginning of the trial.

3. It would be helpful if each addressee could prepare a summary
of the various contacts Werbel has had with CIA in the past. Please check
to see if you have any information on a Colonel Bayard who was killed in
Atlanta, Georgia during the summer of 1975. Bayard, reportedly an
associate of Werbel's, had previous contacts with the Agency. It would
be appreciated if your responses could be received by close of business
2 March.
