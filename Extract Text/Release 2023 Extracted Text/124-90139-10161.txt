any way conflicts with Bureau's interest, immediately
furnish full details and your comments, observations, and
recommendations.(4)

CIA. It is possible PSI, in his activity for the MRP, was
actually doing work for CIA without knowing it since CIA
frequently operated in organizations, such as MRP, through
cutouts.
