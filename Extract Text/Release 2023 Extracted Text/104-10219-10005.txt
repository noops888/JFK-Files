1. RAYMOND H. GERENDE (IDENTITY A) WAS RECRUITED IN MARCH 1955
0
AS A MEMBER OF A STATION UNILATERAL SURVEILLANCE TEAM GERENDE
RECEIVED AN OPERATIONAL APPROVAL ON 28 FEB 55 AND ON 1 OCT 55 WAS
CONVERTED TO CONTRACT STATUS WITH AN INITIAL ANNUAL SALARY OF $3600,
BY LATE 1956 HE HAD BECOME THE PIA IN CHARGE OF THE SURVEILLANCE TEAM
AND ADDITIONALLY WAS IN CHARGE OF PHOTO SURVEILLANCE OF THE SOVIET
MISSION, INCLUDING PROCESSING THE FILM. AT THIS TIME HE WAS DESCRIBED
AS BEING "CONSCIENTIOUS, LOYAL, HARDWORKING AND DEDICATED." IN 1957
HE WAS GIVEN FIVE WEEKS OF CLANDESTINE OPS TRAINING IN THE HOS-AREA,
BEING DESCRIBED BY HIS TRAINER AS MORE "PRO-AMERICAN THAN MEXICAN..
IN LATE 1958 HE WAS DESCRIBED AS ONE OF THE STATION'S MOST VALUABLE
ASSETS", ETC.
2. ON 12 DEC 58 GERENDE MARRIED LIEMPTY-19 (IDENTITY B), WHO
ASSISTED HIM DURING THE NEXT TEN YEARS AS A PART-TIME SUPPORT ASSET,
IN GENERAL GERENDE APPEARS TO HAVE PERFORMED A CREDITABLE JOB AS THE
P/A FOR THE KDFACTOR ACTIVITY, WHICH PROVIDED SURVEILLANCE AND PHOTO
COVERAGE OF THE SOVIET TARGET. AT THE TIME OF TERMINATION, HIS
CONTRACT AGENT SALARY HAD INCREASED TO $7000 PER ANNUM. SIGNIFICANTLY
EXCEPT FOR GIVING ENGLISH LESSONS AND OTHER MINOR COVER ACTIVITIES,
GERENDE WAS CONSIDERED TO BE A FULL-TIME RTACTION EMPLOYEE, HE
PERFORMED A NUMBER OF TASKS IN ADDITION TO KDFACTOR, INCLUDING
SERVING AS LP KEEPER AND TRANSCRIBER/TRANSLATOR OF AN AUDIO OPERATION,
INVOLVEMENT IN OPS AGAINST THE CUBAN MISSION AND CUBAN EXILE GROUPS,
GENERAL OPS SUPPORT, AND SPOTTING AND ASSESSMENT. ON 8 OCT 1963,
GERENDE SUCCESSFULLY PASSED AN SGSWIRL, ALTHOUGH IT EMERGED THAT HE
HAD NOT ACCOUNTED FOR ALL FUNDS PASSED TO HIM (THE STATION DISMISSED
THIS PROBLEM) AND FELT THAT HE WAS BEING UNDEREMPLOYED BY RTACTION.
CONCERNING THE LATTER CHARGE, THE STATION SEEMS TO HAVE HAD PROBLEMS
THROUGHOUT THE 1960'S KEEPING GERENDE FULLY OCCUPIED, SINCE FOR
SECURITY REASONS THERE WAS RELUCTANCE TO INTRODUCE HIM TO ANY MORE
OPERATIONS THAN THE CONSIDERABLE NUMBER HE WAS ALREADY AWARE OF.
(FYI: IN ADDITION TO HIS RIFE, GERENDE'S MOTHER, 201-0262488, AND
TWO BROTHER-IN-LAWS (KDFACTOR-1) AND (KDADAGE-14) WERE ALSO STATION
ASSETS.

3. IN 1969 GERENDE SEPARATED FROM LIEMPTY-19 IN WHAT TURNED
OUT TO BE THE BEGINNING OF AN EXTREMELY ACRIMONIOUS DIVORCE PRO-
CEEDING AND FIGHT FOR THE CUSTODY OF THEIR THREE CHILDREN. IN
DECEMBER 1969 GERENDE WAS PUT ON HALF PAY AND HAD HIS OPS DUTIES
SUSPENDED BY THE STATION BECAUSE OF HIS FULL-TIME INVOLVEMENT IN
LEGAL MATTERS SURROUNDING THE DIVORCE. ON 26 JUNE 1970 GERENDE AND
LIEMPTY-19 SIGNED QUIT CLAIMS AND SECRECY AGREEMENTS. GERENDE WAS
PAID $10,000 AND LIEMPTY-19 $2500 AS TERMINATION BONUSES, AND THE
PAYMENTS WERE MADE ON A MONTHLY BASIS SO THAT THE STATION WOULD HAVE
SOME CONTROL OVER THE TWO AND THEREBY KEEP THEIR RTACTION STATUS.
FROM EMERGING DURING THE DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS. ON 8 JULY 1970
LIEMPTY-19 UNEXPECTEDLY APPEARED AT HOS IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET A LARGER
TERMINATION BONUS. SUBSEQUENTLY LIEMPTY-19 AND HER CHILDREN WENT TO
RESIDE IN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS, WHERE SHE HAS PAID THE REST OF HER
TERMINATION BONUS VIA MONTHLY CHECKS. SENT TO HER BROTHER IN THE
HOS AREA, SHE WAS LAST REPORTED TO BE WORKING AS A SECRETARY AT THE
U.S. MISSION IN THE HAGUE.
4. ACCORDING TO MEXICO CITY 19452, 10 APRIL 72, THE LAST
STATION CONTACT WITH GERENDE WAS IN MAY 1971, WHEN HE RECEIVED THE
FINAL INSTALLMENT OF TERMINATION BONUS. CABLE NOTED THAT GERENDE
APPEARED FINANCIALLY PRESSED, BUT NAS GIVING DAILY ENGLISH CLASSES
AND RENTING HIS HOUSE TO STATION STAFFER JESSE R. GARDALPHE. THERE
CHAS NO INDICATION THAT EITHER GERENDE OR HIS WIFE HAD VIOLATED THEIR
SECRECY AGREEMENTS. STATEMENT. WAS MADE THAT HE NO LONGER APPEARED
TO BE DRINKING EXCESSIVELY.
C
5. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT GERENDE'S AGENT SERVICE RECORD
QUALIFIES RECOMENDATION FOR HIS REUSE BY SAYING THAT HE SHOULD HAVE
SUFFICIENT OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT INCOME TO OBVIATE THE NEED FOR FULL
TIME RTACTION EMPLOYMENT, AND HAVE RESOLVED HIS PERSONAL PROBLEMS.
IT WOULD APPEAR THAT EXCEPT FOR A POSSIBLE ROLE IN SERVICING SPECIFIC
OPS SUPPORT TASKS, GERENDE OFFERS LITTLE POTENTIAL FOR THE STATION,
SUGGEST THAT THE STATION MAY WISH TO DISCUSS GERENDE WITH THEODORE
G. KINDOPP (P) UPON HIS ARRIVAL, SINCE GERENDE WAS HIS LANDLORD
CDURING PREVIOUS STAY IN MEXICO,
