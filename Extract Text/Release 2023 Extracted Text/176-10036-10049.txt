Director Shell-Conakry told Embassy officer September 19
his company fueled Aeroflot IL-18 going to Brazil with
Soviet women athletes and Cubana IL-18, both August 27,
upon direct orders President Toure and Cabinet. Fuel paid
for by GOG. Though Embassy generally confident it will
get news bloc aircraft flights between Conakry and Americas
within 24 hours after event, GOG could order security fueling
operation Cubana and Soviet planes telling Shell keep
silent leaving Embassy in dark.
Since no longer clear check through kerosene Embassy
information less precise and less rapid. Any effort to
check by asking GOG clearly counterproductive.
CAS reported above flights.
