where she prays each night before going to bed.
She had just finished her rosary the night police
came looking for her son.
"There were four of them at the door. They
rushed through the house, searching for Don. I
said he wasult home, but what did they want. him
for? And they said because he shot a little girl,
that my boy killed a child."
Beatrice Antelo was sitting at her kitchen table,
staring listiessly at a cold cup of coffee in front of
her, her voice a weary whisper.
"They didn't have uniforms on, so I thought
maybe they were some of Don's friends playing a
bad joke. I told them to stop fooling around about
something so awful."
Though it was nearly noon now. Beatrice Antelo
still wore her houserobe and slippers. Her small
kitchen was half lost in the stagnant gloom of

The Director has inquired concerning the procedure which was
followed in the Atomic Energy Act applicant case whereby the
Washington Field Office was not alerted to the fact that
Harold Ickes, whose name was given as a reference, should not be
interviewed.
There is attached a memorandum dated December 20, 1949 from
Mr. Rosen to Mr. Ladd with respect to the specific Atomic Energy case
mentioned, namely Fred Ernest Schnepfe, who had given Harold Ickes
as a reference on his PSQ or application form. From a reading of the
attached memorandum which was prepared by Section Chief G. C. Callan
of the Applicant Section, it is obvious that the Supervisors who handle
applicant matters in the Investigative Division do not have any policy
with respect to the interviewing of references, former employers,
associates or others except where the Bureau has specifically indicated
that certain individuals should not be contacted, such as Henry Steele
Commager, personnel of CBS and the like. As a matter of fact, the
present policy in effect at the Seat of Government concerning applicant
investigations is to interview all references and the attached memorandum
indicates that Harold Ickes had been interviewed in the past in connec-
tion with applicant investigations and has exhibited a cooperative
attitude. It would seem, therefore, that no action should be taken
with respect to the supervisory personnel at the Seat of Government con-
cerning the referral of Harold Ickes' name to the Washington Field
Office for interview in connection with the Atomic Energy Act case
mentioned.
As you know, at the Executives Conference the Director's wishes
with regard to interviewing persons who have demonstrated hostile
attitudes toward the Bureau have been considered in the past and no
instructions have been issued to the Supervisors at the Seat of Govern-
ment or to the field concerning this matter except as to specific in-
dividuals whose names have been sent to the field in the recent past
in an SAC Letter. This matter was called to the attention of the
Executives Conference as recently as December 20, 1949 and the Confer-
ence felt it would be undesirable for the Bureau to embark upon a pro-
gram of advising the field to not interview certain individuals in
connection with various types of investigations conducted by the Bureau.
The Executives Conference realized that the hostile attitude toward the
Bureau stems not from our criminal investigative work but from the
Bureau's investigative activity in the field of applicant investigations
and the Loyalty Program. The Conference feels that the blacklisting
of individuals is fundamentally bad and will ultimately result in ex-
treme embarrassment to the Bureau. It is also felt it is extremely
difficult to draft a letter to all SAC's pointing up the problem to
them and expecting them to adhere to any policy which will eliminate
the difficulty which we have encountered heretofore.
I have discussed this matter with Mr. Carlson in some detail
and he feels that we may be able to control to some extent the inter-
viewing of persons hostile to the Bureau at the Seat of Government
without furnishing a "black list" or statement of policy to the field.
Mr. Carlson feels, and I agree with him, that the major portion of our
difficulty stems from the Loyalty investigations and applicant investi-
gations. Mr. Carlson and I therefore propose that the following pro-
cedure be instituted immediately at the Seat of Government in order to
meet the objectives desired by the Director in connection with this
matter:
1. The Crime Records Section shall be responsible for preparing
and maintaining in a current status a list of those individuals known
to be hostile to the Bureau. It is felt that it is imperative that a
list be prepared because the judgment of individual Supervisors re-
ferring cases to the field will differ depending upon the extent of
their day to day newspaper reading, radio listening and perusal of
various and sundry periodicals. It would also mean that each Supervisor
would have to either prepare his own list or endeavor to depend on a
faulty memory. Furthermore, an individual may at one time appear to be
hostile to the Bureau and subsequently his attitude may change and it
may be very desirable to interview him.
2. This list shall be furnished to only those Supervisors at the
Seat of Government who have the responsibility for assigning Loyalty
or applicant cases to the field. This will include Supervisors in the
Loyalty Section of the Security Division, the Applicant Section of the
Investigative Division and those Supervisors in the Administrative
Division handling Bureau applicant cases. This will mean that not more
than 25 Supervisors at most at the Seat of Government will have pos-
session of such a list. These Supervisors shall check all references
and present and former employers against this list before referring
the case to the field for investigation.
It should be realized that the procedure recommended will not
provide against interviews with neighbors of the applicants or
associates whose names are brought up during the course of the inves-
tigation. It is felt, however, that the bulk of the people who are
interviewed in these cases are set out as references by the applicant
and it would only be on a rare occasion that a person hostile to the

THE EXECUTIVES CONFERENCE
DATE: 1/4/50
The Executives Conference of January 4, 1950, consist-
ing of Messrs. Tolson, Glavin, Harbo, Ladd, Rosen, Clegg,
Carlson, Nease and Mohr, in accordance with the Director's in-
structions, considered the attached memorandum of December 21,
1949, with respect to the procedures in conducting applicant
investigations and particularly the method suggested to avoid inter-
views with those individuals having a hostile or critical attitude
toward the Bureau and its work.
It was pointed out to the Conference that apparently the
hostility and criticism of the Bureau stem not from our normal day to
day criminal investigative work but to a very slight extent to inves-
tigations in the Internal Security field and very specifically and
definitely to applicant and Loyalty investigations. It was felt that
if some procedure could be devised to avoid interviews with individuals
in applicant type cases where the individuals have exhibited a hostile
or critical attitude toward the Bureau that much could be accomplished
to eliminate the difficulties experienced in the past. The Conference
felt it would be undesirable to prepare a list of any sort which might
be termed a "blacklist" to be distributed to all of the divisional
offices. It was proposed that the following procedure be instituted
immediately at the Seat of Government in order to meet the objectives
desired by the Director in connection with this matter:
1. The Crime Records Section shall be responsible for preparing
and maintaining in a current status a list of those individuals known
to be hostile to the Bureau. It is felt that it is imperative that a
list be prepared because the judgment of individual Supervisors re-
ferring cases to the field will differ depending upon the extent of
their day to day newspaper reading, radio listening and perusal of
various and sundry periodicals. It would also mean that each Supervisor
would have to either prepare his own list or endeavor to depend on a
faulty memory. Furthermore, an individual may at one time appear to be
hostile to the Bureau and subsequently his attitude may change and it
may be very desirable to interview him.
2. This list shall be furnished to only those Supervisors at the
Seat of Government who have the responsibility for assigning Loyalty
or applicant cases to the field. This will include Supervisors in the
Loyalty Section of the Security Division, the Applicant Section of the
Investigative Division and those Supervisors in the Administrative
Division handling Bureau applicant cases. This will mean that not more
than 25 Supervisors at most at the Seat of Government will have pos-
session of such a list. These Supervisors shall check all references
and present and former employers against this list before referring
the case to the field for investigation.
It was pointed out that the procedure recommended will not
provide against interviews with neighbors of the applicants or subjects
under investigation in connection with the Loyalty Program nor would it
provide against interviews of associates whose names are brought up
during the course of the investigation. Likewise it would not provide
against interviews with college professors whose names were not given
by the applicant or the Loyalty subject as references, but who are
contacted in the course of the ordinary investigation. It was felt,
however, that the bulk of the people who are interviewed in these
cases are set out as references by the applicant and it would only be
on a rare occasion that a person hostile to the Bureau would be inter-
viewed in a neighborhood investigation, as an associate or as a college
professor.
It was also unanimously recommended by the Conference that in
addition to the preparation of the list recommended and the checking
at the Seat of Government by the indicated Supervisors, that where a
specific individual has manifested hostility or unjust criticism against
the Bureau that
