COMMENT: IT IS MOST LIKELY THAT THE FIRST PHASE WILL SUFFICE TO
RELEASE ALL THE BUILT-UP TENSIONS AND PRESSURES IN EL SALVADOR.
:
THIS COUPLED WITH IMMEDIATE DIPLOMATIC INTERVENTION BY THE U.S.,
CENTRAL AMERICAN AND OTHER COUNTRIES WILL PROBABLY SUFFICE TO CANCEL
THE PLANNED SECOND PHASE.)

ESAL VA don
BROTHER OF PRESIDENT FIDEL SANCHEZ HERNANDEZ. THIS GROUP IS ESPEC-
IALLY INTERESTED IN PLANES, ANTI-ANTICRAFT WEAPONS AND SMALL ARMS AND
MUNITIONS. (SOURCE: COMMENT: EVEN IF THIS GROUP FAILS TO BRING
BACK ARMS, IT WILL BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP A MILITARY ACTION
FROM TAKING PLACE. THE BEST HOPE FOR DELAY IS FOR THE GROUP TO
RETURN WITH PROMISES OF ARMS WHICH WILL BE DELIVERED LATER.. IN
THIS WAY PRESIDENT SANCHEZ CAN COUNSEL DELAY UNTIL THE PROMISED ARMS
ARRIVE.)
