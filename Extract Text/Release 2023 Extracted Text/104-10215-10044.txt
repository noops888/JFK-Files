GOP Security Aide
Among 5 Arrested
In Bugging Affair
By Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein
Washington Post Staff Writers
One of the five men ar-
rested carly Saturday in the
attempt to bug the Demo
cratic National Committee
headquarters here is the sal-
aried security coordinator
for President Nixon's re-
election committee.
The suspect, former CIA
employce James W. McCord
Jr., 53, also holds a separate
contract to provide security
services to the Republican
National Committee, GOP
national chairman Bob Dole
said yesterday.
Former Attorney General
John N. Mitchell, head of
the Committee for the Re-
Election of the President,
said yesterday McCord was
employed to help install
Uhat committee's own se-
curity system.
In a statement issued in
Los Angeles, Mitchell said
McCord and the other four
men arrested at Democratic
headquarters Saturday "were,
not operating either in our
behalf or with our consent"
in the alleged bugging
allempt.
Dole issued a similar state-
ment, adding that "we de-
plore action of this kind in
or out of politics." An alde
to Dole said he was unsure
at this time exactly what
security services MeCord
was hired to perform by the
National Committee.
Police sources said last
night that they were seek-
ing a sixth man in connec-
tion with the attempted bug-
ging. The sources would
give no other details.
Other sources close to the
investigation said yesterday
that there still was no ex-
planation as to why the five
suspects might have attempt-
ed to bug Democratic head-
quarters in the Watergate
at 2600 Virginia Ave. NW,
or if they were working for
other individuals or organi-
zations.
"We're baffied at this
point the mystery
deepens," a high Democratic
party source said.
Democratic National Com-
mittee Chairman Lawrence
F. O'Brien said the "bug-
ging incident
..raised the

ugliest questions about the
integrity of the political
process that I have encount-
ered in a quarter century.
"No mere statement of in-
nocence by Mr. Nixon's cam-
paign manager will dispel
these questions."
The Democratic presiden-
tial candidates were not
available for comment yes-
terday.
O'Brien, in his statement,.
called on Attorney General

ing professional investiga-
tion" of the entire matter
by the FBL
A spokesman for Klein-
dienst said yesterday, "The
FBI is already investigat-
?ing... Their Investigative
report will be turned over
to the criminal division for
appropriate action."
The White House did not
comment.
McCord, 53, retired from
the Central Intelligence
Agency in 1970 after 19
years of service and estab
lished his own "security con-
sulting firm," McCord Asso-
ciates, at 414 Hungerford
Drive, Rockville. He lives
at 7 Winder Ct., Rockville.
MeCord is an active Bap-
tist and colonel in the Air
Force Reserves, according to
neighbors and friends.
In addition to MeCord,
the other four suspects all
Miami residents, have been
Identified as: Frank Sturgis
(also known as Frank Fior-
ini), an American who
served in Fidel Castro's re-
voltuionary army and later
trained a guerrilla force of
anti-Castro exiles; Eugenio
R. Martinez, a real estate
agent and notary public who
is active in anti-Castro activ-
ities in Miami; Virgilio R.
Gonzales, a locksmith; and
Bernard L. Barker, a native
of Ilavana said by exiles to
have worked on and off for
the CIA since the Bay of
Pigs invasion in 1961.
All five suspects gave the
police false names after being
arrested Saturday. McCord
also told his attorney that
his name is Edward Martin,
the attorney sald.
Sources in Miami said yes-
terday that at least one of
the suspects-Sturgis was
attempting to organize
Cubans in Miami to demon-
strate at the Democratic
National Convention there
next month.
The five suspects, well-
dressed, wearing rubber
surgical gloves and un-
armed, were arrested about
2:30 a.m. Saturday when
they were surprised by Met-
ropolitan police inside the
29-office suite of the Demo-
cratic headquarters on the
sixth floor of the Watergate-
The suspects had extensive
photographic equipment and
some electronic surveillance
instruments capable of in-
tercepting both regular con-
versation and telephone
communication.
Police also said that two
ceiling panels near party
chairman O'Brien's office
had been removed in such a
way as to make it possible
to slip in a bugging device.
McCord was being held in
D.C. jail on $30,000 bond
yesterday. The other fouf
were being held there or
$50,000 bond.
arft
charged with attempted bur-
glary and attempted inter-
ception of telephone and.
other conversations.
McCord was hired as "se-
curity coordinator" of the
Committee for the Re-elec-
tion of the President on Jan.
1, according to Powell
Moore, the Nixon commit-
tee's director of press and
information.

Moore said McCord's con-
tract called for a "take-home
zalary" of $1,209 per month,
and that the ex-CIA em-
ployee was assigned an of-
fice in the committee's head-
quarters at 1701 Pennsyl-
vania Ave., NW.
Within the last one or two
weeks, Moore said, MeCord
made a trip to Miami Beach
where both the Republi-
can and Democratic Na-
tional Conventions will he
held. The purpose of the
trip, Moore said, was "to es-
tablish security at the hotel
where the Nixon Committee
will be staying."
In addition to McCord's
monthly salary, he and his.
firm were paid a total of
$2,836 by the Nixon Commit-
tee for the purchase and;
rental of television and
other security equipment,
according to Moore.
Moore said that he did not.
know exactly who on the
committee staff hired Me-
Cord, adding that it "defi-
nitely wasn't John Mitchell"
According to Moore, Mc-
Cord has never worked in
any previous Nixon election
campaigns "because he.
didn't leave the CIA until
two years ago, so it would
have been impossible." As of
late yesterday, Moore said,
McCord was still on the
Re-Election Committee pay-
roll.
In his statement from Los
Angeles, former Attorney
General Mitchell said he.

was surprised and dis-
mayed" at reports of Me-
Cord's arrest.
"The person involved is
the proprietor of a private
security agency who was
employed by our committee
months ago to assist with
the installation of our secur-
ity system," said Mitchell.
"He has, as we understand
it, a number of business
clients and interests and we
have no knowledge of these
relationships."
Referring to the alleged
attempt to bug the opposi-
tion's headquarters, Mitchell
said: "There is no place in
our campaign, or in the elec-
toral process, for this type
of activity and we will not
permit it nor condone it."
About two hours after
Mitchell issued his state-
ment, GOP National Chair-
man Dole said, "I under-
stand that Jim McCord
is the owner of a firm with
which the Republican Na-
tional Committee contracts
for security services.. If
our understanding of the
facts is accurate," added
Dole, "we will of course dis-
continue our relationship
with the firm."
Tom Wilck, deputy chair-
man of communications for
the GOP National Commit-
tee, said late yesterday that
: Republican officials
still
were checking to find out
when McCord was hired.
how much he was paid and
+ exactly what his responsibil-
ities were.
McCord lives with his
wife in a two-story, $45,000
house in Rockville.
After being contacted by
The Washington Post yester-
day, Harlan A. Westrell,
who said he was a friend of
McCord's, gave the follow-
ing background on McCord:
He is from Texas, where
The and his wife graduated
from Baylor University.
They have three children, a
son who is in his third year
at the Air Force Academy,
and two daughters.

active in the First Baptist
Church of Washington.
Other neighbors said that
MeCord is a colonel in the
Air Force Reserve, and also
has taught courses in sccu-
rity at Montgomery Commu-
nity College. This could not
be confirmed yesterday.
McCord's previous em-
ployment by the CIA was
confirmed by the intelli-
gence agency, but a spokes-
man there said further data
about McCord was not avail-
able yesterday.
Several address books
seized from the susperis
containesi mostly Spanish
names with Miami address-
es. Police sources said all of
the names in the books were l
being checked.
