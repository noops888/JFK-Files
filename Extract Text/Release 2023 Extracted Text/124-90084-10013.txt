The subject was not interviewed until 1/9/67,
inasmuch as he had moved from his previously known address
and was on a three week vacation in Florida over the holiday
season.
During the interview the subject claimed he knew
nothing of any kind of meeting or conference in Santiago,
Chile, while he was there in February, 1966. He said that
he did not attend such meetings and also that he was very
pro-United States.
It appears that the information in the original
allegation in this matter from CIA to the effect that VICTOR
DELGADO, with re-entry permit number 9245, was present at
Communist Youth Congress in Santiago, Chile, was probably
obtained from the Chilean Customs Records-or from the Chilean
Immigration Records, inasmuch as this subject on interview.
stated he displayed his travel papers to no other person's..
or agencies. It is also noted that he had a visitors visa
to enter Chile which was probably the case of all the delegates
and observers to the Communist Youth Congress
All sources who know, the subject advised during
this investigation that he, although unactive, is anti
States citizen
