Re: Bric H. Aronson

Brooklyn, New York
During ing the period from September 1 1963, when he
matriculated at Hofstra University, Farmingdale, New York,
until June 1970, when he graduated, my son, Eric H. Aronson,
led the student demonstrations against the war in Viet Nam.
He informed me, at that time, that he had, on three occasions,
been subjected to interview and interrogation by agents of
your agency.
He died on August 9, 1975. As I am writing writing a book on
his life, I request, under the Freedom of Information Act,
that you forward me any and all information, writings and
material you have in your file on him.
May I hear ar from you at your carliest opportunity.
Very truly yours,
LL.WE
Arthur J. Aronson
