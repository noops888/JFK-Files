On September 3 while having a coffee break in the Computer

openly spoke about his past and stated that he now lives in Moscow
and that he is a consultant to

Centre. He said much of his work is done at home but he does drop
into the Centre weekly.
It was at this time that MARTIN told KUNOV that he would
ike to get out of the USSR even if he has to run certain risks. He
also said that (Bernon) MITCHELL feels the same and has
voiced his
desire to the Soviet authorities.
MARTIN asked KUNOV if he might enquire with the Canadian
authorities on his behalf to see what his status would be in this
country or if there was any chance of his being allowed in here as
a political refugee. KUHOV agreed to contact the Canadian Embassy
in Moscow to see what the official view would be and notify MARTIN
at a later date. MARTIN seemed most pleased at this and left KULIOV
his home telephone number, cautioning him not to say anything over
phone that would tip off the Soviet authorities as to his intentions.
This first meeting lasted a little over one half hour and took place
in the coffee lounge area of the Centre. There were other Sovicts
present in the lounge, however,

KUTNOV enquired about the Americans
living in the USSR and asked could they be allowed to immigrate to
Canada. The Embassy official would not commit himself and stated that
KUNOV should enquire officially with the nearest office of Manpower
and Immigration when he returned to Canada. KUNOV did not give this
official MARTEI or MITCHELL's names. KUHOV telephoned MARTIN after
the Embassy visit and stated that the reply from the Embassy was
negative. MARTIN seemed upset that KUNOV should phone him, then he
later stated that it would probably be all right.
MARTIN met KUNOV on at least two occasions after the
5 September, all at the Centre, usually in the coffee lounge and in
the general presence of others. They spoke English at all times.
MARTIN thanked KUMCV for his trouble in enquiring at the Embassy and
cautioned KUNOV not to get personally involved with him in this
venture as it would be bad news. KUICOV promised MARTIN that he would
check with Canadian lanpower and Immigration authorities on the
matter when he returned to Canada

on current problem areas in the Soviet society. For example
he discussed dissidents in Soviet society and commented on one

Dear Harry,
We have learned that on the evening of 8 September 1975,
James WILKINSON of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow had a conversation
of interest with a Canadian Embassy Officer. Wilkinson stated
that while attending a social function at the Australian Embassy,
he engaged Canadian Consular Officer Geoffrey FARRON in conver-
sation. Farrow advised that he had been recently approached by
Dr. Harry KERNOV, an Associate Professor of English at the
University of Toronto in Canada, regarding American defectors
Bernon F. MITCHELL and Willian H. MARTIN. Kernov implied that
he had had recent personal contact with one or both of the
defectors and recommended that the Canadian government give
Martin and Mitchell permission to emigrate to Canada.
furnished no further details regarding Kernov's contact.
Farrow
During the same conversation Farrow asked Wilkinson if he
could supply any basic background material on Mitchell and Martin.
Wilkinson replied that he would pass Farrow's request on to
the Consular Section of the Embassy. Subsequently, Farrow was
given an unclassified article concerning the defectors which
appeared in the June 1961 issue of True magazine.
We would, of course, be interested in any indications that
Martin and Mitchell are attempting to leave the USSR and would
be grateful for any information you may be able to provido us
in regard to the above.
I am using
in this instance as this
information has been passed to us informally.
