RE QUESTION EXTENT NIEXIT HAS BEEN USED BY KUBARK, BELIEVE
01.
FOLATFE PECAPITULATION OUR OPS INVOLVESNICAL MAY HELP
PUT ISSUE IN CLEARER PERSPECTIVE. WHILE NIEXIT ASSISTED KUBARK IN
PREVIOUS ASSIGNMENTS, KUPARK DID NOT INITIATE ACTION HAVE HIM UNDER
TAKE ANY QANDESTINE MISSIONS IN CUBA. BY COINCIDENCE. AMRIPE-2. MAVE
AGENT RECRUITED ENTIRELY INDEPENDENT OF NIEXIT, BUT WHO PERSONAL
ΤΑ ΙΣΝΟ ΝΙΣΧΙΙ, PREVAILED UP ON NIEXIT TO CARRY VIT TRANSMITTER IN
INTEXIT POUCH. NIEXIT CONCURRED IN THIS SUGGESTION WHICH
OL
ORIGINAL TO STTH AGENT, NOT KUBARK. KUBARK TOOK ADVANTAGE THIS OPPOR
TUNITY AND SENT IN SET WITH STRONG REQUEST IT NOT BE OPERATED FROM
CSMSSY WAT OPERATOR INVOLVED WAS AT TIME NOT WILLING OPERATE

SET ANYWHERE ELSE BUT EMBASSY.
NIEXIT AT NO TIME OBJECTED TO THIS
ACTIVITY AND IN FACT USED THIS KUBARK VAT FACILITY ON SEVERAL OCCASION
TO SEND KIS OWN REQUESTS TO KUBARK. WAVE THEN USED NIEXIT POUCH TO
RESUPPLY WIT OP. HOS ALSO MADE DIRECT USE NIEXIT POUCH FOR COMMO
TO AMSOUR OP.

6. AT NO TIME DID KUBARK ASK NIEXIT ATTEMPT COLLECT INFO HICH
NOT EASILY AVAILABLE TO HIM RESULT HIS OFFICIAL POSITION, TAKE PHOTO
GRAPHS OR OF HERVISE ENGAGE IN ANY ACTIVITY WHICH COULD HAVE RESULTED
01
IN STORT EXPOSURE OR EMBARRASSMENT TO NIEXIT.
NIEXIT ROLE HAS BEEN
0
ESSENTIALLY PASSIVE ONE OF PERMITTING USE HIS POUCH FACILITIES.
7,
IN THIS CONTEXT APPROPRIATE POINT OUT THAT KUBARK IN
ADDITION TO NUMEROUS CUBAN EXILE GROUPS HAS MADE FREQUENT AND REFEAΙ
USE VIRTUALLY ALL VESTERN EMBASSY POUCH FACIL IT IES TO TRANSMIT EQUIP
MENT AND SUPPLIES TO INSIDE AGENTS. MANY EMBASSIES INVOLVED HAVE
ANTICIPATED MUCH MORE DIRECTLY IN THIS ACTIVITY THAN HAS NIEXIT
VOLUME THIS ACTIVITY PAY ON SURFACE APPEAR UNUSUAL, UNSETTLED CONDITIONS,
CURA, FACT MAJORITY CUBANS ARE OPPOSED REGIME, OPPORTUNITIES SMUGGLE
AND TIES FRIENDSHIP WHICH MOST WESTERN DIPS ESTABLISH WITH ANTI-REGIME
CUBANS ALL CONTRIBUTE TO VIDESPREAD USE WESTERN DIP POUCHES FOR INTEL
PURPOSES. THUS, THIS ACTIVITY IS NOT ONLY NOT UNUSUAL BUT ACTUALLY
COMMON PLACE INSOFAR AS CUBAN OPS SCENE IS CONCER NED.

BELIEVE IMPORTANT NOTE THAT NIEXIT-1 REPORTING THROUGH
SY INGO APPEARS CARRY TENDENCY DRAMATIZE AND EXAGGERATE. PROBABLE
EXPLANATION FOR THIS IS THAT NIEXIT-1 WHILE WELL INTENTIONED, IS NO
MENTAL GIANT AND SINGLY DOES NOT COMPREHEND ISSUES INVOLVED. ASSUME
THIS RESULTS IN HIS FEEL ING INSECURE WHICH MAY IN TURN EXPLAIN WHY H
FEELS NECESSARY INFORSS INGO ALL INTEL ACTIVITIES KNOWN TO HIM.
