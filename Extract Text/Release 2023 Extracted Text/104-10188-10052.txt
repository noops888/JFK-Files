Renewal of LIENVΟΥ
1. Project LIENVOY is due for renewal on 1 February 1968.
Would you please let us have a renewal request by 1 January 1968.
2. LIENVOY was estimated at $57,000 in our recent FY 1968
program exercise, so we must ask that you stay within this figure
in the renewal. If you will be needing replacements for equipment
for the LP, would it be possible to reallocate funds previously
budgeted for LISALAD and for "purchase of information" to cover
the cost of such procurement?.
3. Headquarters appreciates the carefully detailed renewals
which you prepare on LIENVOY because they give such a good picture of
what the project produces. Could you also include in the current
renewal a brief description of the center and the equipment and
how the management of the daily routine is shared between AREHART
and his Mexican colleagues?

PROJECT BRIEFING

WH Mexico
1 Feb 67 31 Jan 68
ACTION: ADD/P approval of renewal
PURPOSE: Project supports a joint CIA-Mexican Government telephone
tap unit and a non-official liaison relationship with access to
the highest ranking Mexican officials.
PROGRESS: During the past year covered a total of 30 telephone lines:
simultaneously providing 8, 644 reels of raw take. Of the 30
lines, at least 15 of them are exclusively for Station targets
and the remaining targets are chosen by the Mexican authorities
but are usually of interest to the Station. Station targets include
the Cuban Embassy, the Soviet Embassy, Czech Embassy,
Polish Embassy and the New China News Agency.
FI/INT files contain 107 positive intelligence reports produced
during the review period. This production, although unavoidably
uneven in quality and coverage, included a considerable amount
of useful information relevant to priority needs of the community.
LIENVOY coverage of Cuban and Soviet installations has been
of particular usefulness as a check on Station operations. A
set of voice samples of Soviet officials has been collected which
assists the identification of unidentified speakers elsewhere.
The channel established to the President of Mexico has been
used to promote a close personal rapport between the President
and Chester D. DAINOLD (p) and in consequence closer co-
operation between the Government of Mexico and the U.S.
Government and CIA in particular.

COMMENTS: FI and CI Staffs concur in renewal.
FI STAFF: Observes that there is a weakness in the
operation because of its size. The threat of mere numbers--
transcribers, lines tapped, reports produced, leads ex-
ploited--increases the mathematical probability of compro-
mise. The Station appears to be fully aware of this problem
and is maintaining tight security discipline.

staff agents and two other contract agents also work on this

years but the project still yields more reports than any other
Co audio operation anywhere. Most of the reports concerned
Mexican Communists, covering toples of generally high interest as
well as reports of moderate value on local political parties.

Project LIENVOY -- Renewal Period 1 February 1937-31 January 1968
Comments and Recommendations (To be forwarded to the Division)
1. Our files contain 107 positive intelligence reports produced wholly
or in part by LIENVOY and disseminated in the period 1 February 1966-31.
January 1967. Over half of this production (60 reports) dealt with plans and
activities of Mexican Communists and other leftists. Included were 17
reports which provided useful information on the unrest at the National
Autonomous University (UNAM) and other universities. As our recent
study of reporting on Mexico indicates, student unrest has been a subject
of high interest to the community. Also included were 13 disseminations
which contributed to the station's coverage, highly praised by all customers,
of leftist activities in connection with President Johnson's visit. The other
30 reports in this group, primarily concerning the PCM, MLN, and PPS,
varied considerably in quality but in general appeared to be of moderate
value in relation to customer needs.
2. The disseminated production from foreign Communist installations
was relatively meager. There were 9 reports on relations with the Soviets,
mostly on cultural programs; 3 reports on commercial negotiations with
Czechoslovakia and Poland; 7 reports concerned with Cuba; and 5 reports
on Chicom (NCNA) activities in Mexico. With the possible exception of
information on Mexican-Bloc trade -- a subject of much interest to ORR --
the LIENVOY coverage of official Communist installations did not provide
positive intelligence of any great significance. Notably lacking was informa-
tion on foreign subversive efforts against Mexico, for which customers have
expressed an urgent need.
3. The rest of the production for the period included the following:
9 reports concerning Guatemalan exile activity, which appeared to te of
value; 9 reports on activities of the press secretary of the Presidencia which.
contributed to coverage of the government's pians ani activities -- an area
on which the community has a high priority need for information; and one
report concerning initiatives for a Vietnamese peace which was disseminated
as an Intelligence Information Special Report to the Director. There were
also 4 reports on right-wing Sinarchist activity, a subject of relatively
little interest to customers.
SECRET
1400000
SECRET
4. In summary, the positive intelligence production as a whole,
though unavoidably uneven in its quality and coverage, included a considerable
amount of useful information relevant to priority needs of the community.
While this disseminatei product in itself would hardly justify the total cost
of the project, we assume that a substantial portion of the cost is warranted
for purposes other than collection of positive information. Consequently
FI/INT/RE recommends renewal.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans
SUBJECT
: Renewal of the LIENVOY Project
1... Renewal is requested of the LIENVOY Project
for the period 1 February 1967 through 31 January
1968 for a total of $57,100, with $22,470 for FY
1967 and $34,630 for FY 1968. The LIENVOY Project
was included in the 1967 Operational Program for
$50,000. The additional funds required for FY
1967 are available within WH Division.
2. The LIENVOY Project covers both access to
high level Mexican Government officials, including
the President, and a joint telephone tap operation
run in cooperation with the Office of the President.
3. The phone taps produce FI, CE, and operational
support information. According to Headquarters
records, during the period 1 February through 31
December 1966, LIENVOY was the source of ninety-eight
positive intelligence reports, seventy-nine of which
were disseminated. These reports covered the follow-
ing general subject categories: Soviet Embassy
activities in Mexico, Mexican Communist Party activi-
ties, Communist front activities, the activities of
the Chicom representatives in Mexico, and the
activities of various extremist groups. Included in
this reporting was that prior to and during President
Johnson's trip to Mexico City in April 1966. The
Station's reporting on this trip, which included
LIENVOY, was highly praised by the customers. LIENVOY
also provided some good coverage during the trouble
at the National Autonomous University (UNAM) in the
spring and useful information during disturbances at
some of the other universities. The remainder of the
LIENVOY Coverage could be considered of medium-level
interest and value. During the same period, LIENVOY

provided information for ten CE disseminations to

and Cuban Embassies in Mexico.
4.
LIENVOY coverage, particularly of the Cuban
and Soviet installations, was useful as a check on
the Station's operations. It furnished information
on double agents directed against the Soviets, for
instance, and on several agents in contact with the
Cuban Embassy. LIENVOY also identified leads into
the Soviets, some of whom have since been recruited
as access agents. (e.g. LIROAN and the LIROBBIN's)
Another example of the usefulness of LIENVOY is the
set of voice samples of Soviet officials which has...
been collected and which permits the identification
of unidentified speakers on other coverage. For
example, recently in LIFEAT a man speaking with
Suzie PIERRE Charles, a Haitian Communist, was
identified as Vladimir Ivanovich SHPAKEVICH (KGB).
LIENVOY is also the principal source of information
on the travel of Soviets within Mexico and abroad.
The Station has a standing requirement for informing
the Office of the Legal Attache in Mexico of all
travel performed by Soviet officials within the
Republic of Mexico, and LIENVOY helps the Station
to fulfill this request.
5. LIFEAT, the unilateral telephone tap
operation, concentrates on individual Soviets, Cubans,
Communists, and Americans who are of special WOFACT
CE interest.
6. The channel established to the President of
Mexico through LIENVOY permits direct contact by the
Chief of Station.
While there is also a channel
through the LITEXPO Project, the President and the
Station are both careful to select the proper channel
which depends on whether there is an anticipated need
for the cooperation of the LITEMPO Ministry, or
whether the contact and problem should remain a matter
of concern only to the President and his special
advisor. As can be seen from the attached renewal
request prepared by the Mexico City Station, the

obtain advice on personal and communications
security, and on the purchase of technical equipment.
The Station, on the other hand, has used this special

8. It is believed that the close personal

relations and closer cooperation between Mexico and
the U.S. Government and CIA in particular.
Division recommends renewal of the LIENVOY Project.

Project LIENVOY
1. FI Staff recomends renewal of project LIENVOΥ.
The
project will cost $27,100 for the period 1 February 1967 to 31
January 1968. The cost covers salaries and support expenses
for 12 Spanish-speaking local hire contract employees. Two
staff agents and two other contract agents also work on this
project, providing zanajement and a Slavic translation capability.
The staff agents are covered by other projects and the Slavic
translators are paid on a piece-work basis. The desk estimates
these additional costs to run about $35,000 a year.
2. As in prior years, this is a three-sided project: it
provides positive intelligence, serves as an operational instru-

between the Chief of Station and the President of Mexico.
The
intelligence product has declined in volume over the past rew
years but the project still yields more reports than any other
Co audio operation anywhere. Most of the reports concerned
Mexican Communists, covering toples of generally high interest as
well as reports of moderate value on local political parties.
Positive intelligence return on bloc targets was relatively
Reagen. The attached FI/IT memorandum provides an analysis of
the positive intelligence product.
3. The operational information produced by LIZI/VΟΥ was
significant this year as in the past. The information acquired
on the Cubun target as particularly valuable. During President
Johnson's visit the taps were very useful in the station's efforts
to safeguard the President's postal security. Liaison with the
President of Mexico was setive and cordial this past year. The
mail intercept was undertaken at his request.

and excellently eloited to is its acc. Lee. The thrent cr
