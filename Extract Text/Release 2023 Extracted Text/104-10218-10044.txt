MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division
SUBJECT: Termination of Project LIHUFF
1. It is requested that the LIHUFF Project be
terminated, effective 30 June 1970.
2. Project LIHUFF covered funds for one agent,
LIHUFF-1, a U.S. businessman resident in Mexico City
who had served in World War II with U.S. military
intelligence (MIS/X). LIHUFF-1 provided the Mexico
City Station with access into the right-wing political
groups and the American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico.
He also obtained Dunn and Bradstreet reports for the
Station and performed other tasks from time to time.
3. LIHUFF-1 was actually terminated effective
28 February 1970. No funds were expended for the
termination, as he was not given a termination payment.
He was paid his salary of $300 per month, plus social
security contributions, up until the time he was
terminated. During FY 1970 $2,528.41 of LIHUFF Project
funds were expended.
4. There were no known problems or security
risks in connection with the termination. A quitclaim
was not obtained. LIHUFF-1 was advised concerning his
social security benefits derived from his CIA employ-
ment and told to contact the Station should he have
further questions.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division
SUBJECT: Renewal of Project LIHUFF
1. Renewal of Project LIHUFF in the amount of
$4,000 is requested for the period 1 July 1969 through
30 June 1970. The Project was budgeted for $4,000 for
FY 1970 and funds are available within WH Division.
2. LIHUFF represents Mexico City Station's access
into right wing political elements and organizations in
Mexico, and provides contact with the large and influ-
ential American business community there. In addition,
his access to Dun and Bradstreet reports has also been
useful in carrying out checks on WOLADY citizens of
operational interest to the Station. During the project
year three field information reports were credited to
the Project, one of which was disseminated by Head-
quarters, and some thirty-five background investigations
and file traces were conducted by the agent.
3. In paragraph D "Effectiveness" of the attached.
renewal request it was noted, "He (LIHUFF-1) also organ-
ized at the request of COS (who, in turn, had been
requested by Headquarters) a public demonstration in
front of the Soviet Embassy in protest against the in-
vasion of Czechoslovakia." A review of the LITEMPO
Project reveals that LITEMPO-4 was paid $4,000.00 by the
Station to organize and rally as many students as possible
in addition to the MURO planned demonstration in front of
the Soviet Embassy, and to Headquarter's knowledge LIHUFF-1
did not organize the student demonstration on behalf of the
Station.
4. The Desk feels that this Project should be reviewed
during the upcoming project year to determine whether it
should be continued.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DC/WH
SUBJECT: Renewal of Project LIHUFF
1. Project LIHUFF covers a singleton agent (a U.S.
citizen) who has been managed directly by the COS, Mexico
City, and who has worked for WHD for more than twenty years,
beginning in Panama and continuing in Mexico. LIHUFF-1 pro-
vides the Station access to right-wing political elements and
contact with the American business community in Mexico City
(he is executive director of the American businessman's
association).
2. The project provided three disseminations in Fiscal
Year 1969, and it is deemed unlikely that it will ever be a
source of effective and meaningful intelligence.
3. WH/FI suggests that LIHUFF-1 be considered for one or
several specific support tasks, which represent a continuing
burden for Station Mexico City, and that he no longer be con-
sidered as a source of intelligence.
no
4. If it is ascertained that he can perform/support
task(s), we advise that the project be terminated. In the
meantime, we recommend approval in the amount of $4,000 for
Fiscal Year 1970.

REQUEST FOR RENEWAL
PROJECT LIHUFF
A. CURRENT OBJECTIVES
The objective of this project is to provide support for a singleton
contract agent, LIHUFF-1, who is the Executive Director of the most
important organization of WOLADY businessmen in Mexico. He also
continues to have access to right-wing political elements and
organizations in Mexico, one of which is a right-wing student
group (principally at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico
UNAM).
B. CHANGES
1. Operational Mechanism
There have been no changes in this respect since the previous
project renewal was submitted.
2. Agents
The only agent to be supported by this project for the coming
year is LIHUFF-1.
C. INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTION
1. Three disseminated reports were credited to this project
during FY 1969:
HMM-11890 "University Rector's Conviction that U. S.
Promoted Student Riots."
HMM-12003 "Views of Minister of Industry and Commerce
on Forthcoming Visit of Nelson Rockefeller."
HMM-12008 "Views of Minister of Industry and Commerce
on Government Control of Radio and Television."

2. This agent is used as a source for background, opera-
tional and investigative data. For that reason it does not
produce a sufficient amount of positive intelligence to justify
its existence for that purpose. Its real value is the
availability of this agent and his contacts to the Chief of
Station, Mexico, for a current reading on right-wing political
activities and personalities. He is also a primary investiga-
tive source for information on WOLADY citizens of operational
interest to the Station. This agent has access to all reports
produced by Dunn & Bradstreet in Mexico and can have investiga-
tions conducted by them.
D. EFFECTIVENESS
During the project year, the agent provided the Station
with details on a proposed new federal labor law (which was
subsequently passed) and an analysis on how this new law would
affect foreign investors or companies. The agent also kept "the
Chief of Station, Mexico, advised of right-wing political
activities and student agitation. He also organized at the
request of COS (who, in turn, had been requested by Headquarters)
a public demonstration in front of the Soviet Embassy in protest
against the invasion of Czechoslovakia. LIHUFF-1 conducted
about thirty-five background investigations and file traces for
the Station.
E. PROBLEMS
This project has presented the Station with no problems of
security or cover.
F. LIAISON
This project involves no liaison relationship.
G. INTERAGENCY COORDINATION
This project involves no interagency coordination.
H. PLANS
FORWARDED BY SPLIT TRANSMISSION
NO FIELD DECLASSIFICATION
Station Mexico plans to continue to use LIHUFF-1 as a
support agent and informant on activities of right-wing

SUBJECT: Renewal of Project LIHUFF
1. Renewal of Project LIHUFF in the amount of $4,000
is requested for the period 1 July 1968 through 30 June
1969. The project was budgeted for $4,200 for FY 1969 and
funds are available within WH Division.
2. During the past year, one progress report was
received, in June 1968, recapitulating the activities
reported in the attached renewal request. Although the
Station has made use of LIHUFF's relations with the right
wing student organization, MURO, in connection with
Evgeniy YEVTUSHENKO's visit to Mexico this spring, the
use of MURO is being de-emphasized. The main value of
LIHUFF/1, a long time collaborator previously serving in
Panama and beginning in OSS days, is his availability to
service various requests which the COS may make of him
and to provide insight into the activities of the extreme
right wing of Mexican politics. His access to Dun and
Bradstreet reports has also been useful.
