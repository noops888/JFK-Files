✓ A review of the Miami file regarding
ORLANDO GARCIA VAZQUEZ reveals he was born in Cuba
in 1927 and served in the U.S. Army from 1945 to
1947, during which time he obtained U.S. citizenship.
He thereafter returned to Cuba and attended the
University of Havana under the G.I. Bill and
during this period was reportedly active in an

anti-Communist group. He was a member of the Cuban
Secret Police under former President CARLOS PRIO
(1948-52) and later opposed the BATISTA regime in
Cuba and the TRUJILLO in the Dominican Republic.
He served with FIDEL CASTRO as civil attache at
the Cuban Embassy in Costa Rica until March, 1960
when he was discharged for his admitted "reactionary
attitude" and friendship with former Costa Rican
President JOSE FIGUERES. He subsequently moved
to Venezuela obtaining Venezuelan citizenship in
1962 and has since served in the Venezuelan Foreign
Ministry and worked with the Venezuelan National
Police (DIGEPOL).
He reportedly served as body
guard for former Presidents BETANCOURT and LEONI of
Venezuela as well as JOSE FIGUERES of Costa Rica.
A 1960 allegation that GARCIA was a
CASTRO agent in Miami was resolved to the satisfaction
of CIA who recruited him during that year. As of
1965 CIA advised GARCIA_was still of operational
interest to this agency and there is no indication
at this time of a change of this status.(A)

It is apparent from above that GARCIA is
highly placed in the Venezuelan Government and is
anti-Communist in ideology. He has long been
Cof operational interest to CIA and presumably
is still in contact with this agency. Miami feels
no additional investigation is necessary and is closing
its case on GARCIA.
It is noted the Miami Office is in contact
with LESLIE LLOYD ANDREWS, GARCIA's stepson who is
is under development as a PSI in Venezuelan matters
and may obtain information regarding BARCIA sifuture
trips to Miami.
