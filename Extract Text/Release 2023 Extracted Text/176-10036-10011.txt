1. THE SITUATION IN ELIZABETHVILLE AND IN THE NATIVE COMMUNES IS TENSE AND
POTENTIALLY EXPLOSIVE. OBSERVATIONS IN THE LATE MORNING OF 12 JULY OF THE U.N.
EMPLACEMENTS, AND BEHIND THE KATANGAN LINES, SHOWED THAT INDIAN FORCES OF THE U.N.
ARE NOW DEEPLY DUG IN AROUND A LARGE SCHOOL AREA NEXT TO THE ROADBLOCK ON THE
MAIN TRAFFIC ROUTE BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN AND THE AFRICAN CITY. THERE ARE NUMEROUS
ARMORED CARS AND COMBAT-READY TROOPS. THESE, TOGETHER WITH THE LONG-EXISTING
ROAD BLOCK WHICH HAS NOW BEEN STRENGTHENED BY TUNISIAN U.N. TROUPS ON THE AL-
TERNATE ROAD TO THE COMMUNES, HAVE VIRTUALLY SEALED OFF THE NATIVE CITY. TRAFFIC
WAS BEING ALLOWED TO PASS, BUT AFRICAN CROWDS WERE COLLECTING NEAR THE EMPLACE-
MENTS ON BOTH SIDES.
2.
ARMED KATANGAN TROOPS HAVE MOVED FROM DEEP IN THE COMMUNES TO HIDDEN
