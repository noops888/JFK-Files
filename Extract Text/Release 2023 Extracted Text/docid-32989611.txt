MEMORANDUM FOR LIEUTENANT GENERAL BRENT SCOWCROFT
THE WHITE HOUSE
Subject: Senate Select Committee Request
for Documents on the Cabinet
Committee to Combat Terrorism
The Department of State has been asked by the
Senate Select Committee investigating intelligence to
provide information on the structure and functions of
the Cabinet Committee to Combat Terrorism and its
Working Group. Because all of the basic documents con-
cerning the CCT are Presidential, we are forwarding them
to you for review for possible release to the Senate
Committee.
The relevant documents are:
Memorandum for the President from Secretary William
P. Rogers on September. 18, 1972 (the report referred to
in the President's Memorandum of September 25, 1972);
Memorandum for the Secretary from President
Richard M. Nixon on September 25, 1972; and
Six reports to the President from the Chairman
of the Cabinet Committee to Combat Terrorism (the Secretary
of State).
These documents set forth the basic structure and
functions of the Cabinet Committee and its Working Group.
62-116 395-339
There are many functions of the Cabinet Committee and
its Working Group discussed in the reports to the
President other than the intelligence function being
investigated by the Senate Select Committee. We do not
see any need for the discussion of these other functions.
to be withheld from the SSC.

In addition to the above documents, we would also plan
to provide the Senate Committee with the following nar-
rative statement on the CCT and intelligence:
Begin Statement (CONFIDENTIAL):
With the exception of a weekly publication by the
CIA on international terrorism, requested by the Cabinet
Committee on January 1, 1973, the intelligence functions
of the Cabinet Committee and its Working Group are handled
through established interagency channels. The agencies
most active in generation and coordination of terrorism
information for the Working Group are the CIA, the FBI,
NSA, DOD, the Secret Service, the Department of Treasury
and the State Department.
SECRET
(CONFIDENTIAL When Separated
From Accompanying Documents)
These Working Group agencies set their own priorities
and parameters concerning intelligence on terrorism mat-
ters. From time to time the CIA requests comments from
the Working Group on its weekly terrorism reports.
The organization of the Cabinet Committee is de-
lineated in the President's memorandum of September 25,
1972. The Working Group is composed of senior repre-
sentatives of the ten agencies on the Cabinet Committee
and representatives of the following agencies: Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency, Energy Research and
Development Administration, Federal Protective Service,
Immigration and Naturalization Service, Law Enforcement
Assistance Administration, Metropolitan Police Department,
National Security Agency, Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Office of Management and Budget, and the United States
Information Agency. These additional agencies were in-
vited to participate in the Working Group by the Special
Assistant to the Secretary and Coordinator for Combatting
Terrorism (S/CCT), in his capacity as Chairman of the
Working Group.
Under the Working Group there is one formal sub-
group, the Behavioral Science Resource Group (BSRG),
which is composed of behavioral science experts from
the State Department, the CIA, the FBI and USIA. The
State Department member chairs BSRG. The Resource Group
(CONFIDENTIAL When Separated
From Accompanying Documents)
has a mandate to seek to improve the United States'
response to acts of international terrorism through use
of behavioral science techniques.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES
Reference is made to memorandum of K. William O'Connor,
Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, to Mr. John Mintz, Legal
Counsel Division of this Bureau, dated June 26, 1975, captioned "DAG
Inquiry Re Communication by Former AAG Doar to FBI Regarding
Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party Delegation."
Regarding your request contained in referenced communication
for the Bureau to locate and furnish certain documents, it is my under-
standing that you are in possession of the documents requested.
In response to your request that we furnish our observations
concerning the making of the documents available to former Assistant
Attorney General John Doar, may I suggest that this raises an issue
which has been discussed in the past by the Bureau and the Department
and other Government agencies. This issue to my knowledge has not
been resolved. That issue is whether a former employee should be
allowed access to documents in the Government's possession to refresh
his recollection for possible testimony before the Senate Select Committee.
It is this Bureau's position that such documents should not be made
available for the aforementioned purpose, and in those instances where
a former employee cannot respond accurately to the question of the Senate
Select Committee or any other Congressional investigative body, the
Committee or Congressional body can be referred to the appropriate
bureau or agency which will, if appropriate, furnish the necessary
information. I am sure you will understand our concern in this regard
insofar as setting a precedent which might serve for future requests of
this nature.

Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination

NOTE: According to referenced communication Mr. Doar requested
to review a communication he caused to be sent while in the Department
asking for information concerning the Mississippi Freedom Democratic
Party Delegation. The Deputy Attorney General had asked that the
documentation concerning the request and our response be located and
furnished to him. The Department also asked our views as to whether
he should be given access to or delivered the documents for the purpose
of refreshing Doar's recollection.

FROM: K. William O'Connor
Special Counsel for Intelligence
Coordination
SUBJECT: DAG Inquiry Re Communication by Former AAG Doar.
to FBI Regarding Mississippi Freedom Democratic
Party Delegation
(1) The DAG has asked me to request that the Bureau make
a file check to determine what, if any, documents may be found
in FBI files relating to a request made by Mr. Doar in August
1964 for information and Bureau action regarding members of the
subject delegation. It is our understanding that Mr. Doar
requested certain information from the FBI regarding this dele-
gation in mid-August 1964; and that some information was delivered
to the DOJ (either to Mr. Doar or then DAG Katzenbach) shortly
thereafter, in the latter part of August 1964.
(2) It is possible that Mr. Doar may be asked about these
matters in connection with the Senate Select Committee inquiry
(reference Appendix D, Item 7, 5/14/75 SSC request). The DAG
has also asked that, after such documentation as may be developed
under (1) above has been located, the Bureau furnish to him its
view as to the access/delivery to Mr. Doar of such documentation
for the purpose of refreshing his recollection.
(3) An expeditious response to this request will be
appreciated.

Mr. J. A. Mintz

6/11/75
Mr. W. R. Wannall
Mr. W. O. Cregar
Mr. R. L. Moore
By letter dated 5/14/75, with attached appendices,
the SSC requested certain information and documents from
the FBI.
Appendix C, Item number 10, requested all memoranda
and other materials relating to the elimination of the Liaison
Section of the FBI in 1970 and its reestablishment in late
1972.
Among the enclosures to our letter to the Attorney
General (AG), dated 6/13/75, being proposed for forwarding
to the Committee is E. S. Miller memorandum to Mr. Felt,
7/14/72. On page 2 there is information that "our close
association with the Chief Postal Inspector and his top
officials has resulted in that agency providing support in
some of our most delicate intelligence operations looking
to the identification of illegal hostile intelligence
activities in this country." This could possibly be construed
to include opening of mail. It is to be noted that opening
of mail by FBI is the subject of a separate SSC request and
future correspondence with the SSC, through the AG, will
address itself to this subject. Former Chief Postal Inspector
Henry B. Montague, with whom we have had extensive dealings
in the past, is scheduled to appear before the full SSC on
6/12/75 and it is expected that he will be questioned about
possible FBI participation in mail openings.
