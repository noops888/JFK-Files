identified some of the materials in the KENNEDY investigation
which were released on 12-7-77 as those which apparently

In addition, on 1-5-78, Mr. Mr. BOB BERG, SRF brought

investigation. At his suggestion, copies of these documents
were made for temporary retention in the files of this office
and the set furnished by BERG was returned to him on 1-6-78.
