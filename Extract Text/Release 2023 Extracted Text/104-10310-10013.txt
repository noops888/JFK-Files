2023 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
SECRET
12 September 1975
SUBJECT: Responses to SSC Request for Additional Information on
Project ZRRIFLE
REFERENCE: William G. Miller Letter to Mr. Walt Elder, 3 September 1975
Response:
1. a. The cryptonym FUJUBE is apparently a garble and FUTURE
is probably meant instead. This is a cryptonym belonging to LA
Division assigned to a U.S. citizen formerly of operational interest
to us. His true name cannot be divulged because, according to our
records, he still resides abroad in the country against which he
was targeted as a reporting source. Revelation of his identity and
of his past association with us would be dangerous to his security.
b. The cryptonym KUTUBE referred to FI Staff, now known
as the Operations Staff.
c. The cryptonym DMLIVID was assigned to a Yugoslav Major,
Djuroje Djurovic
2. a. LANRICLE was an action indicator for FI/D.
b. Monroe B. ROZENEY, Ed JOUVENOY, Wanda CRICKARD and James
N. RABNEY are all pseudonyms. They were assigned respectively to:
13-00000

SECRET
3. Mr. Harvey was issued the pseudonym Daniel M. PRESLAND in
1956 and he used this pseudonym until he retired in 1967. This is the
only pseudonym he used in connection with the ZRRIFLE Project and Cuban
operations. Mr. Harvey was issued the alias William WALKER in May
1962 and he continued to use it while he was Chief of the Cuban
operations until he was reassigned in June 1963. There is no indication
in the file that Mr. Harvey used this alias in connection with the
ZRRIFLE Project. There is no record that Mr. Harvey was ever issued
or used a cryptonym.

Remarks: We have searched documents available to us
in Headquarters without success. There may be some
chronos at records center that contain additional info
but that would require several days. Suggest Review
Staff talk to Charlie and determine if he can remember
what uses he made of the alias documentation and if he
wrote M/R's after each use.
(It would be helpful if Review Staff could provide
deadline dates for inquiries. This was received in
A.M. 9 Sept with no deadline and at 1530 we were told
deadline was COB 9 Sept).
