LETTER NO.

FROM:
SA/C/LA
SUBJECT: Department of Justice Request to Release Information on
Antulio RAMIREZ Ortiz to House Select Committee on
Assassinations
REF:
FBI Report of Theodore N. Goble, 28 July 1961 (DBF-84088)
The information contained in the last paragraph on page one and
the first paragraph on page two of reference may not be released to
the committee because it apparently was obtained through liaison.
The information is repeated from CSCI-3/765,713 which in turn was
based on a report from Santiago de Cuba (HKSA-171, 25 April 1958).
The information in HKSA-171 was passed to the Department of State
at some time because the last two paragraphs on page two and the
paragraph on page three of reference, information on Ramirez from
the Department of State repeates the information quoted from HKSA-171
and should not be released either.
