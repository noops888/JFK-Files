The captioned organization, consisting of anti-Castro Cuban
refugees, periodically has come to our attention in connection with
raids planned or directed against Cuba. ( Desmond Fitzgerald, CIA,
furnished the following to the Liaison Agent on 10/7/637
(4)
Pursuant to instructions from the White House, CIA is
currently exploring the possibilities of collaborating with this
organization in promoting activities directed against the Castro
Government. This will include raids against Cuba. All such raids
would be initiated from British territory in the Bahamas and it will
be necessary for CIA to coordinate with the British (5) (0)
Fitzgerald requested that this information not be disseminated
outside of the Bureau and he further asked that if the Bureau received
any information concerning Commandos L activities, such data not be
disseminated to the British without first consulting with CIA.
ACTION:
The Nationalities Intelligence Section has been informed
concerning the above. If approved, we will not disseminate informa-
tion to the British without first consulting with CIA. (4)
