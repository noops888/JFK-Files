1. The following report is submitted in accordance with CSFHB-н
52-6-1, section V, paragraph 2 (d) (1).
A. EXPLOITATION OF LEADS
(1) LIFEAT/Soviet Daring the reporting period, LIFEAT coverage
of Svyatoslav F. KUZNETSOV provided an important and valuable check con-
firming the reporting of a number of KUBARK controlled double agents targeted
against this Soviet officer. Also, coverage of the Soviet Bulletin Office, al-
though not considered vital, does complete Station coverage of the Soviet
target and does provide daily information on the activities and contacts of the
Bulletin Office personnel.
(2) LIFEAT/Polish
LIFEAT continued to provide vital Information
concerning the BEKNAVE/BECHICK operation with coverage of both Individuals
and their daily activities.
(3) LIFEAT/Yugoslav Besides the usual coverage of day-to-day
activities of the official installation, LIFEAT leads have indicated the possi-
bility of a successful recruitment of a Mexican employee of that installation,
LIFEAT information will become even more valuable for continuing assess-
ment of the potential agent and forming of a plan for approach to the Mexican
In question.
(4) LIFEAT/Communist Party Coverage in this area gave Station
its first information concerning the second arrest of LINLUCK, as well as
providing sonie information on important persons in the Mexican Communist
movement.

(5) LIFEAT/Exile LIFEAT provides continuing coverage of the
daily activities and contacts of juan Jose AREVALO Bermejo, Although most
of the leads gathered will depend on future exploitation, one contact with an
ODYOKE official was noted by LIFEAT (see reference b).
(6). LIFEAT/Cuban Of late, much of the emphasis of the LIFEAT
operation has been directed toward support of Station operations in this area,
Coverage included monitoring of the activities of AMSTET-1 for the interested
Case Officer. This information provided daily leads for the Case Officer in
his contacts with AMSTET-1. LIFEAT also covered three lines in support
of the AMSTRUT operation. Of this support the interested Case Officer has
noted LIFEAT provided very valuable coverage of the important AMSTRUT
operation during October. The coverage gave valuable operational leads
_ and resolved what would otherwise have been areas of uncertainty or
groundless suspicion. This allowed the case officers to move with more
certainty in developing the operation than would otherwise have been prudently
possible. It is noted that LIFEAT's continuing coverage is proving to be most
helpful.
(7) LIFEAT/American Communists LIFEAT continued to provlie
information of interest to ODENVY. Travel and contacts of the ACGM are
particularly worthwhile.
(8) LIFEAT/Miscellaneous LIFEAT continued its coverage of
former Station asset LIVESTOCK-2. This was in keeping with Station's
policy of making perlodic checks of the activities of former, potentially
dangerous agents.
It should be noted that It is the Station's opinion that LIFEAT'S
excellent overall service, plus its ability to provide unilateral coverage of
targets of opportunity on short notice (sometimes on as little as two hours
notice), make LIFEAT a dependable daily contributor to the fulfilling of the
Station's mission,
B. PROCESSING OF TAKE
No change from previous report.
C. LIAISON
During the month of October the two playback recorders used by
the ODENVY processor broke down. These were repaired by the LIFEAT
technician, David M. WILSTED, ODENVY continued to process take from
the LIFEAT/American Communists in Mexico lines,
:
D. SECURITY
There have been no known adverse security incidents effecting the
LIFEAT operation during the reporting period. LIFEAT meeting sites con-
tinue to be changed periodically. The fourteen regular and six alternate
sites used for daily contact between the Station Case Officer and WILSTED
and Wayne C. DRABAND are considered adequate. Numerous meeting sites
are used for contacts between WILSTED/DRABAND and the basehouse keepers.
E. TECHNICAL.
Audio and dial tape recorders ordered by the Station in support of the
LIFEAT operation began to arrive at the end of October. These were placed
in immediate service. It is noted that the automatic tape stop on the new
model Revere audio recorder has thus far proven to be of no use to the operation

and on occaston has caused some minor problems. It is believed that these
problems are temporary and will be eliminated when WILSTED has time to
by-pass this cut off switch.

1. The following report is submitted in accordance with CSFHB-F
52-6-1, Section V, Paragraph 2 (u) (1).
A. EXPLOITATION OF LEADS
(1) LIFEAT/Soviet In this reporting period LIFEAT provided vital
Information and live-monitoring support during the installation phase of a
successful Station technical operation targeted against Aleksandr G. SIDOROV,
Soviet Military Attache in Mexico.
(2) LIFEAT/Cuban This coverage provided valuable operational
support during the period leading up to the recruitment of AMSTRUT-2 giving
timely advance information of AMSTRUF-2's arrival in Mexico, as well as
his day to day activities and contacts. Following AMSTRUT-2's recruitment,
LIFEAT gave an excellent account of AMSTRUT-2's activities for those periods
he was not under the control of his case officers. This was invaluable proof
of his full cooperation with KUBARK and added a safety factor for the case
officers making the recruitment and initial handling which would not have been
otherwise available.
(3) LIFEAT/Polish and LIFEAT Yugoslav
These coverages con-
tinue to provide excellent information of the daily activities of the Satellite
officials assigned to Mexico. The LIFEAT support of the BEKNAVE/BECHICK
operation continues as noted in reference.
(4) LIFEAT/Exile LIFEAT coverage of Juan Jose AREVALO Ber-
mejo provides information and operational leads which, though valuable now,
would be invaluable if ODYOKE's policy toward AREVALO becomes sufficiently
defined to fully exploit all the information provided by LIFEAT

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: DEBRIEFING OF DAVID H. WILSTED (ps)
1. On 1 June 1960 Mr. John G. Heyn and Mr. John Kennedy of WHD,
Mr. Robert Brown of CI/OPS, Mr. Robert Bryant of FI/OPS and Mr. Charles
Bray of FI/D met with David H. WILSTED (ps).
2. WILSTED emphasized that the whole telephone system in Mexico
City has sub-contracted this work of cleaning up and reorganizing the phone
system to the independent firm, Intel. They are cleaning up unused and
old lines, putting in new and spare lines, redefining exchange areas,
laying underground cables, etc. Eventually we should be better off be-
cause there should be more surplus lines. The renovation work has
hampered much of the LIFEAT work, principally because many of the lines
now are underground and we cannot get access to them before they enter
the central. This is particularly true with respect to the Czech Em-
bassy, to whose telephone lines we cannot obtain access from the vantage
point we now occupy.
3. WILSTED said that we try to keep track of the activities of
"Intel" but since they seem to attack "Colonias" at random, we have no
prior warning of their presence in a certain area.
4. In the recent past, Mexico has been using houses for listing
posts for security reasons. We have more control over the access of
phone company inspectors or repairmen to houses. However, under new
regulations, all new apartment buildings must have telephone lines in-
stalled in the building by the phone company during the construction
phase. This means that the lines and their destination are concealed.
WILSTED proposed that this will mean we can again use apartments since
we can siphon off a line destined for use by another tenant in such a
way that the phone company cannot trace its destination without tearing
the building apart and we can then install a separate line to the build-
ing and hook up the subscriber to this line which, if checked, will
belong to a legitimate subscriber.
5. One system which has been used effectively is to take one-half
of two separate pairs which have one faulty line each. These two half
pairs then form one good pair which we can use.
6. WILSTED explained that it cost about 3000 pesos to get a
regular telephone. This entails the purchase of a telephone company
bond, which later can be sold.

Personnal involved in the tapping of the lines are:
Rene - who has access to the centrals. He contacts the fol-
lowing mant
Two brothers
Jose does exchange connections.
8. The take from each basehouse is collected early in the morning
before office hours by RAFANBILLI. He only enters one basehouse which is
occupied by an elderly couple. All other contants are in automobiles
made at different spots each day of the week. RAFANELLI then takas the
material to a neeting between him, WILSTED and SECHEN where FA PANELLI
turns the material over to SECHEN and they all discuss the problems and
plans for the day.
9. According to WILSTED there is no live monitoring done by any
of the basehouse keopore.

1. The following report is submitted in accordance with CSHB-F 52-6-1,
Section V, paragraph 2 (d) (1).
A. Exploitation of Leads
(1) LIFEAT/SOVIET
With the departure of Vladimir G.
NOVIKOV during the month of August 1962, it was decided that LIFEAT should
pick up coverage of his replacement Svyatoslav F. KUZNETSOV. The contin-
ued coverage of aleksandr G. SIDOROV, which includes extensive periods of
live-monitoring and special processing of the take, is considered essential to
those Station assets involved in the attempt to place the technical surveillance
noted in last month's report (see reference A). Coverage of the Soviet Bulletin
Office continues to provide interesting personality data on Soviet officials
assigned to Mexico,
(2) LIFEAT/POLISH
LIFEAT coverage in support of the
BEKNAVE/BECHICK operation continues to be vital to that operation. Addi-
tional coverage for this operation has been undertaken, leads from which will
probably determine future direction of the operation as well as naid KUBARK in
controlling the operation.

(+) LIFEAT/EXILE
LIFEAT coverage in this area has been
most rewarding in providing leads to the contacts of Juan Jose Arevalo Bermejo,
"former Guatemalan President, Spanish Republican Exiles were covered for
approximately one-half month in August, at which time it was decided that the
coverage no longer provided sufficient leads and information to justify con-
tinued LIFEAT effort.
(5) LIFEAT/American Communis: Group in Mexico (ACGM)
This coverage is at the request of the local office of ODENVY and the processing
of take in this area is done by that office. One of the most interesting items
provided from this coverage was the fact that the American Communists Albert
MALTZ and Margaret Larsin MALTZ had separated and that Albert MALTZ
would probably reside in the U.S. with Margaret remaining in Mexico. Con-
cerning the LIFEAT coverage of the ACGM, the local office of ODENVY wrote
on 23 August 1962: "This office feels that the coverage mentioned is quite
valuable and many useful leads are obtained from this coverage, particularly
with regard to travel in and out of Mexico of American Communists who are
in contact with individuals on whom coverage is maintained".
