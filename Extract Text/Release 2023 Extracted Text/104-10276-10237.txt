EXCERPT of ATTACHMENT:
On the night of 10 May 63, I met (LITAHIL-9
reported as follows:
LITAMIL-9
1. Manuel VEGA Perez, Cuban G-2 Mexico, told L-9 that he had been
with Dolores DE LA MCRA Cepeda and that DE LA CRA asked for
L-9. L-9, of course, will take advantage of VEGA's remark to
make contact with DE LA MORA. comerted that the fact VEGA
was with DE LA MORA is interesting. It will be recalled that
"Conchita" FERNANDEZ told 1-9 to be careful with DE LA ICRA
because she is a contact of CLERGE Fabra, Cuban G-2 type.
