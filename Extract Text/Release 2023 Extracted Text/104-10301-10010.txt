with a limited number of people. We believe the direction of the
station is of high caliber, but not all the station effort is
carefully directed at priority targets. Under current personnel
ceilings, there is little hope of increasing the manpower avail-
able for this critical effort. Thus, both Headquarters and the
station must carefully place emphasis on assignment of priorities
and upon selective execution of the activities to meet those
priorities.
Organization for Operations
5. The Mexico City Station approaches the classic type station
in opportunities and in operations. It has high-level
operations, unilateral operations, joint operations with the host
government, and Soviet, Satellite, Cuban, and indigenous Communist
Party operations. It has local collaborative liaison with other
U.S. agencies: the State Department, the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation, the Immigration and Naturalisation Service and the military.
To accomplish this wide range of tasks, the station is organized
into the Soviet Branch, Cuban Branch, Satellite Branch, Covert
Action Branch, Communist Party Branch, and an operational catch-all
which is called the "Operational Support Branch." This latter
branch is headed by a senior operations officer who has two assist-
ante, but the branch in reality is an extension of the chief of
station's personal clandestine capabilities, giving force and
effect to that facet of the chief of station's personality as an
operator. The deputy chief of station, in addition to his admin-
istrative duties, also personally handles the operations of three
projects.
Cuban Operations
6. Mexico City is the only direct air link which Cuba has
with the Western Hemisphere. It is the major transit point for
all air travel to and from Cuba. Approximately 150 persons per
week travel each vay to and from Havana via Mexico City. This
fact plays a prime role in shaping the station's operational activi-
ties. For example, over 10 per cent of the station's FI reporting
on Cuban activities in the past year dealt with travel, both Cuban
and non-Cuban, between Mexico City and Havane.

IL. The station's Cuban case officers must devote a substan-
tial effort to responding to requests for support from other
stations, chiefly JIHAVE, with involvement in Cuban operations.
24 Approximately 47 per cent of the station's cable traffic is con-
cerned with Cuban operations. This volume alone is testimony to
the relative effort which must be devoted to the support of Cuban
operations originating in other CIA stations. The Cuben case
officers in Mexico City feel that the requirements to keep abreast
of day to day activities and to handle the volume of paper left
insufficient time for planning and development of an effective

and the results, while limited, are as satisfactory as tong conducted against the Cuban Babassy, 24

pected in view of the target. Given Mexico City's strategic loca-
tion astride the only direct air link to Cuba, more success should
be achieved in (recruiting agents in place in Ciba. This target
has been assigned as Priority i to many Latin American countries
and, if it is to be achieved at all, it is logical to expect that
it will be done in Mexico City. To the extent possible, the Caban
case officers should be freed from the excessive support to other
stations so they can comestrate on this target. The Chief, WH
Division, should direct other stations to carefully screen Cuban
requirements on Mexico City, with a view toward reduction of such
requirements.
It is recommended that:
The Chief, WE Division:

ing agent assets resident in Cubas and,

countries. (Because of the relative ineffectiveness of the Mexican
police and security services, Boviet activities in Mexico are not
subjected to the same scrutiny as they are in the U.8 by the FBI 24
and in Canada by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Soviet person-
nel in Mexico thus have a freedom of movement which facilitates the
conduct of clandestina operations targeted not only against the U.S.
but also against other Latin American countries where there is no
Boviet official presence. In addition, Mexico's long border with
the U.S. has only minimum guards. Travel between the U.B. and
Mexico is heavy and clandestine border crossing can be relatively
simple. The Soviet Embassy in Mexico City, therefore, assumes more
than the usual interest normally attached to similer Soviet in-
stallations as targets for U.8. intelligence.
20. Soviet operations conducted by the station are directed
24 primarily at the personnel of the embassy. At the present time,
there are fifty-one officers attached to the embassy of whom thirty-
24 three have been identified as mambers of either the HUB or the GRU.
It may be assumed that dependents and nonintelligence persoanel,
by performing various support functions, swell the total of those
engaged in intelligence assignments. In its operations against the
Soviets, the station is heavily dependent upon technical collec
tion through telephone tape, photographic coverage of the embassy,
physical surveillance, and hidden microphones. These operations
24 produce masses of information daily on the activities of the Soviet 24
personnel, such as telephons conversations with persons outside the
embassy, complete photographic records of the coming and going of
24 all persons-Soviet and non-Soviet-at the embassy, contests of
embassy personnel outside the embassy, etc. Because of the strict
security indoctrination of Boviet oversees personnel, the bulk of
this information is low-level and not dissexinable as positive in-
24
24 telligence. Its chief value, aside from occasional items of intelli- 24
gence interest or operational import, derives from its compilation 24
in depth to reveal patterds of activities and contacte, indicative
of intelligence missions or associations, and to disclose behaviorial
characteristics of individual Soviets which might be symptomatic
of a vulnerability to recruitment. Bromalyzing this twin over
period of time, the stationsbeeldentified Boviet officers in the
KOB and GRU, and gained an insight into into their modus operandi in
executing intelligence assigaments. This in itself is of value
from a counterintelligence point of view even though exploitation
against Soviets has been limited. Also, by collating the mes of
collected data into personality reports on persons stteched to the
Kabassy, the station hopes to be able to detect, foster, and even
tually exploit any vulnerability to recruitment or detection-the

[action to counter these activities) as they night affect U.s.
Interests. While all the 8.8.8.R. diplomatic missions are targets
of vital importance for U.S. intelligance, the Soviet Embassy in
Mexico City has special significance because of its proximity to
the U.S. The Mexico City Station has attacked this target with
determination and imagination. The Chief, SR Division, and his
principal officers have commended highly the Soviet operations in
Mexico City Station. The failure the far to achieve the major 24
objectives is testimony more to the impregnability of

24. Probably the most significant contribution which the
station's operations against the Soviets in Mexico City has made 06
to the U.8. security has been peripheral to the Agency's mission
there. The embassy has long been a magnet for disaffected Ameri-
cans who vant for one reason or another to establish contact with
the Soviets. Through its technical coverage of the Soviet Embassy, 24
the station has been able to spot and, through subsequent action,
to thwart a number of such Africans, several of whom might have
done untold damage to U.S. interests had they not been apprehended. 24
In this respect, the station works closely with the FBI. The
Warren Commission's report on the assassination of President
Kennedy made reference to information collected by station assets
in connection with Oswald's activities in Mexico City.
25. The Batellite Branch, which is staffed by EK Division
personnel, has been diverting much of its recent time from its E
targets to a Comamist-Chinese presence in Mexico City. Although
there is no official government representation by the Peking regime,
the Hew China Rove Agency (CHA) has several people in Mexico City.
At least three of these individuals have been identified as CHICOM
intelligence officers. Project EIPESO is an endio operation against
three rooms of their offices, and their telephone lines are tapped
inder the LIFEAT Project. Bone of their wail has been examined
through the LIKAYAK Project. The raw results of these operations
have been forwarded back to Headquarters. The Mexico City Station
has no capability for the translation of the material. As of the
time of the inspection, the station had heard nothing from Heedquarter

Technical Operations
42. The station is heavily committed in the technical field
with a large audio operation run jointly with the Mexican Govern-24
ment (LIKIVOY), as well as a unilateral audio operation (LIFEAT). 24
The station has been imaginative in approaches to problems and
villing to examine and experiment with the umsaal. an example of
this is the communications link between the station and the princi- 24

Organisation for Administration
56. As in his direction of operations, the chief of station
mintains a close personal hold upon the administrative life of
his station. Such delegation as he makes does not include the
granting of usual authority to a subordinate. For example, although
the deputy has been delegated authority over the Registry, which
vill be discussed in detail later, in reality the chief continues
daily activities which have a marked effect on the Registry. The
station has a smil, hard-working support section, handling finan
cial and proparty matters, and the usual fine comamications
section.
57. Morale and health vere generally good, although for a
city as modern as Mexico there is an unusual amount of abdominal
disorder known in Mexico City as "Hontezuma's Revenge." The
enbassy furnishes adequate medicines, and medicines are available
on the open mrket, although not always to be trusted. One inci-
dent was recently uncovered in which sulfur vas capsuled and sold
as an antibiotic. Medical facilities have recently been improved
by the opening of a new hospital which meets United States standards.
Physicians and surgeons are well trained and quite competent.
Insofar as social life is concerned, morale in the station vas
excellent. Mexico City offere some of the finest social activities
in the world, from houky-tork to opera. There is local television,
radio, and a great interest in music. There is a great deal of
outdoor activity available-swimming, tennis, golf, exploration
of ruins, and vast city parks. Some sporte activities are compara-
tively expensive. Masbership in country clubs is prohibitive ex-
cept for persons on the diplomstic list.
58. One of the principal administrative problems fating the
Chief of Station, Mexico City, is his Registry. The Registry
handles the station files which are more complete then in any
other station in the WE Division. There are more than 9,000 per-
sonality files and a vast accuraılation of 35 card files (mostly
biographic) which contimse to increase at the rate of 23 linear
inches per month. The station's present level of activity pre-
cludes any reduction in the card index file, but aperture cards
- 22 -

are assisting in some reduction of the personality files. The
Registry also handles the pouching. This task is also the largest
in the WH Division, particularly in lateral pouching. On one occa-
sion, at Headquarters' request, Mexico City handled the lateral
pouching to 35 stations and bases of one document.
39. The problems of the Registry are compounded by the lack
of training provided personnel assigned to the Registry. Person-
nel problems in the Registry are many and diversified. First of
all, with the limited number of personnel and the great burden of
work, a large amount of overtime has been required. Secondly, it
has been difficult to get people to accept an assigment to the
Mexico City Registry because the tasks are dull, tedious, and infi-
nitely demanding of the individuals' time. The morale in this
section was poor. We made several recommendations to the chief of
station pointing out to him a conscientious effort must be made by
all members of the station to reduce the workload in the Registry.
In this connection, we suggested that individual case officers ac-
cept the responsibility for periodic cleaning of files which they
used, and of which they have the most intimate knowledge. We
further recommended that maximum discrimination be used in determin-
ing material which should be filed and that wherever possible the
sheer bulk of the filing be reduced. We further recommended that
overtime be made voluntarily whenever possible, but that in any
event personnel be provided with a full weekend off from time to
time.
60. The chief of the Registry is the only senior person as-
signed to the Registry and has no deputy or other person competent
to take his place during his temporary absence. The chief at the
time of our inspection had taken very little time off, including
weekends in the two years of his tour. We feel that one of the
positions in the Registry should be re-evaluated for possible upgrad-
ing to includes the duties of deputy chief of Registry.
It is recommended thatt
The Chief, WH Division, request the Director of
Personnel to conduct a review of the function of
Deputy Chief, Registry, Mexico City Station, to deter-
mine whether or not such a position should be estab-
lished in an appropriate grade

61. We found the Registry to be a controversial matter between
Headquartere and the chief of station. The newly assigned deputy
chief of station, whe primarily had supervisory responsibility over
the chief of Registry, was making a determined effort to reduce the
vorkload in the Registry and to seek means of relying upon Hend-
quarters' files rather than station files. We were told that on
several cccasions, Headquarters had reached the point of demanding
that Mexico City reduce its Registry to a sise comparable to other
stations. Each time such a decision was reached, there would be
a concurrent flap which would prove the value of Mexico City's
ability to instantly retrieve information from their files. One
of the most noteworthy of such flaps took place in November 1963,
when Mexico City's files brought forth detailed information on
Lee Harvey Oswald's visits to the Cuban end Soviet Ribassies in
Mexico City.
62. The nature of Mexico City's operations, particularly ite
technical operations LIENVOY and LIFEAT produce [voluminous files.] 24
Until some system is devised for this information to be quickly 24
24digested and retrieved in Headquarters, we believe that there is
no alternative to the present system Mexico City is employing.
However, we believe that a determined effort must be in Headquarters
for processing and retrieval of such information.

It is recommended that:
The Chief, WE Division, in collaboration with the
Chief, Records Integration Division, devise a mysten
for reducing the volums of files held in Narico City,
while maintaining a capability for rapid retrieval
fron Headquarters of information essential to present
and future operations in Mexico.

63. Mexico City is one of the great setropolises of the world
and the booming economy of Mexico is reflected in its housing. It
is difficult to find housing which compares exactly with United
States housing because the Spanish tradition of servants' quarters,
large space, and grand entertainment are a basic way of life.
However, in such a great city, there is naturally a large selection
of housing within this limitation. There are good apartments, but
such apartments usually are more expensive than allowances will
permit for single occupancy. Housing for officers and families is
generally quite good, not plentiful, but with prudent selection,
adequate housing can be found within reasonable range of the
