CHIEF OF DISIP'S FOREIGN ESPIONAGE DIVISION. ALLL THREE OF THESE
MEN WERE ORIGINALLY CUBAN CITIZENS. (SOURCE COMMENT: GIFFUNI
DID NOT REVEAL THE EXACT NATURE OF THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE MEN.)
2. THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT THE CUBAN EXILES
ARE ATTEMPTING TO SMEAR THE THREE MEN, BECAUSE OF THEIR PART IN
ARRESTING CUBAN EXILE LEADER ORL AN DO BOSCH AND LUIS
POSADA WHO HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED IN THE CUBANA CRASH..
NONETHELESS, ACCORDING TO GIFFUNI, LEPAGE HAS APPOINTED A SPECIAL
COMMISSION HEADED BY GIFFUNI TO INVESTIGATE THE CHARGES MADE
AGAINST THE OFFICIALS,
GIFFUNI ALSO SAID THAT HE IS EXPLORING
THE POSSIBILITY OF DISCREETLY INFORMAING NORBERTO HERNANDEZ
CURBELO. CUBAN AMBASSADOR TO VENEZUELA, OF THE CUBAN EXILE CHARGES
AGAINST THE MEN AND HIS INVESTIGATION OF THE CASE (FIELD COMMENT:
A CHANNEL BETWEEN GIFFUN! AND HERNANDEZ WAS INITIATED WHEN GIFFUN!
WAS DISIP DEPUTY CHIEF. SEE HVC-7380, TDFIRDB-315/04976-76. OF MID MAY,
FROM THE SAME SOURCE WHOSE RELIABILITY HAS BEEN SUBS EQUENT LY
UPGRADED. GIFFUNI HAS REASON TO HARBOR RESENT MENT
:
SINCE HE AND RIVAS WERE BITTER RIVALS INSIDE DIS IP AND SINCE GARCIA AND
RIVAS REPLACED HIM AT DISIP. MORALES, IN TURN, IS CLOSELY
ASSOCIATED WITH GARCIA.)
