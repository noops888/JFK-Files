A. TASKS
Part V. pp. 5-8, of General Lansdale's program review of
the Cuba Project, dated 18 January 1962, assigns 32 specific tasks
to elements of the U.S. Government. Of these, 16 are assigned
to CIA solely or jointly. The tasks have been reviewed by this
Agency, and it has been determined that substantially all reporting
and planning deadlines can be met. Work on all tasks, with and
without assigned dates for completion, is in progress. The
following detailed observations are keyed to General Lansdale's
paper.
1. Task 1, p.5. The intelligence community is hard at
work on NIE 85-62 and is attempting to meet the deadline of
7 February. As was agreed in a conversation of 23 January 1962
with General Lansdale, a short extension may be necessary..
2. Task 2, p.5. The Opa-Locka Interrogation Center in
Florida will be in operation on 15 February the deadline date.
3. Task 3, p.5
The survey is in progress and will be
completed on the stipulated date On the basis of the information
CIA HAS NO OBJECTION TO

obtained the possibility of establishing additional interrogation
points will be determined.
4. Task 4, p. 5. An operational assessment of the stay-
behind net in Cuba will be completed and reported by the deadline
of 15 February. Because communication with singleton agents is
by SW, not W/T. it is unlikely that assessment can be completed
by the date stipulated; an extension to 28 February may be
necessary, although every effort is being made to complete the work
before that dat
An intensive program aimed at the acquisition

of third country assets through the cooperation of liaison services
is also under way, particularly in Spain, Belgium, France,
Uruguay, and Costa Rica. A progress report on the status of
this program will be made by 15 February, although this Agency
cannot be sure that the cooperation of all intended participants will
have been obtained by that date. CIA has also taken the follow-
ing additional steps in respect to Task 4.
a.
A cable has been sent to field stations to give added
impetus to the search for assets and the development of both
unilateral and joint operations. Progress reports have been
required by 1 March.
b. A survey of the Cuban Chinese community and of

operational access to it is under way. Target date: end of
February.
c. An assessment of more than one hundred persons to
determine their suitability for return to Cuba as agents tin in
the guise of studentis studentsis also being conducted. Target date:
end of February.
5. Task 5, p.5. The 1 February deadline will be met, and
by that date we shall also have begun the search for suitable inter-
mediaries. Analysis to date has not uncovered a top-level official
of the Cuban regime whose personal characteristics indicate he
would accept recruitment or agree to defection now. Although
some targets of opportunity will appear outside Cuba, most planning
will necessarily be based upon an appeal made inside the island by
intermediaries selected from the ranks of journalists, foreign
officials, international businessmen, foreign lawyers, crime
syndicates, international detectives and foreign police officials.
Additionally, plans for the defection of lower-level Cuban officials
abroad have been completed, and the search for targets and access
abroad is under way.

6. Task 6, p. 5. By the assigned date we shall complete
and submit a coordinated plan. We shall also have begun action on

cover and deception operations by that date.
7. Task 7, p. 5. Byl February CIA will submit an opera-
tional schedule for the initiation of an organized resistance move-
ment inside Cuba. The schedule will include the localities selected
and the assessment of some candidates. A full assessment will
be completed in accordance with the schedule listed in para. 4,
above, in conformance with Task 4. It should be noted, however,
that this operational schedule (like the schedules called for in
Tasks 10, 26, and 30) will necessarily be tentative and subject
to later revision as the number of assets inside Cuba increases
and as the flow of intelligence is augmented. Moreover, the
development of a resistance movement will not remain controllable,
so that operational timetables produced during the next four weeks
can serve only as guides for a proposed sequence of actions.
8. Task 10, p. 5. CIA has on hand both propaganda and
political action assets in the Caribbean area and elsewhere in
Latin America. It is planned to use those assets both to support
the Project inside Cuba and to generate and mobilize public and
official opinion against Castro outside Cuba. The operational
schedule will be submitted on the stated date.
9. Task 18, p. 6.) 6.) Discussions with the appropriate AFL-CIO

officials have been donducted and a feport of developments will be
submitted by 15 February.
10. Task 21, p. 7. Plans for inducing the failure of crops
will be submitted by 15 February. These plans will envisage both
the use of controlled assets who can be infiltrated and exfiltrated
and the provision of encouragement and guidance to the resistance,
so that it will undertake acts of sabotage, some of which are to
be directed against crops, particularly rice.

Task 24, p. 7. This deadline will also be met. Primary
methods of disrupting the supply of Cuban nickel to the USSR could,
if approved, include (1) the sinking of Cuban or Bloc ships by open
attack; (2) the use of "frogman" or UDT tactics in harbors for the
same purpose; (3) the employment of torpedos and mines toward
this end; and (4) the sabotaging of primary or secondary sources
of Cuban nickel, such as the Nicaro and Moa plants. CIA now has no
proven internal assets capable of carrying out any of these actions.
The Agency does have external assets capable of undertaking actions
(2) and (3). It also has an external group capable of undertaking
(4) upon the completion of specialized training All studies,
including a plan for using overt or covert means to prevent re-
institution of the Canadian supply to the USSR, will be submitted
by 15 February. It is suggested that consideration be given to

12. Task 26, p. 7. Together with Tasks 27 and 28, Task 26
constitutes an outline of a plan for a psychological warfare operation.
These tasks are so closely interrelated that CIA proposes to submit
by 15 February a single plan dealing with all three tasks.
13. Task 27, p.7. See preceding paragraph.

Task 28, p. 7. See paragraph 12.
15. Task 30, p. 7. By 15 February CIA will submit an opera-
tional schedule dealing with the sabotage of (1) shipping in Cuban
waters and harbors, (2) Cuban transport facilities, (3) communications
facilities, (4) equipment for the refining of petroleum, (5) facili-
ties for producing and distributing power, (6) industry. (7) food
supplies, (8) key military and police installations and materiel.
The schedule will also include the disruption of military and police
communications and harassment of military and police training and
personnel.

17. Section D, p. 3. Six men, to form the initial nucleus,
have been assessed in depth. Further assessment of candidates
inside and outside Cuba is in progress, and it is expected that ten
of these will be recruited by
February.
18. Section E, p. 3 To date fifteen locations have been
selected as suitable centre of resistance because of (1) the presence
there of groups among which there is patent or incipient unrest,
(2) the presence of strategic and tactical targets for use or deacti-
vation, and (3) proximity to potential unconventional warfare areas.
In order of priority, the fifteen centers are Havana, Camaguey,
Santa Clara, Cienfuegos, Matanzas, Cardenas, Sancti Spiritus, the
Escambray Mountains, Holguin, Siantago de Cuba, Ciego de Avila,
Baracoa, Pinar del Rio, Manzanillo, and Colon
