(U)(WAGES stated that informant's involvement witě
ROLANDO MASFERRER, who is widely known as an active anti-
CASTRO exile and who has formed previous expeditions, may
well be the reason for the failure of "ALEJANDRO to contact (U)
informant during and since the scheduled meet on 9/10/66.
(U) WAGES Said MASFERRER has made no secret of his invasion
plans among local Cuban exiles and this plan is undoubtedly
known to Cuban Intelligence Service (CIS), as is possibly

and informant's involvement in these activities could
conceivably leave the impression with CIS that informant
is concealing this information from them. WAGEST therefore, (U)
felt it would certainly be appropriate to include a reference
to MASFERRER's activities, if possible, in any message to his
mail drop in Cuba.
The following is the proposed message to be written
(U) by informant in secret writing to the mail drop in Cuba,
following instructions previously issued by informant's Cuban (U)
case officer. This message, of course, would be written in
the Spanish language:
"Beginning
(U) Alejandro failed to show up at the last (0)
scheduled meeting at the Dixie Hotel on
(U) (September 9 and I don't know why.
I
have information requested by him and I
also have urgent information regarding
an invasion plan by Rolando Masferrer. (
I have made several trips to the
(U) Dominican Republic to obtain a base for
storage of Masferrer's firearms and this
invasion is imminent. Do not publicize
this as my life would be endangered.
Have Alejandro contact me.
End.

WAGES advised he could give on-the-spot approval of
CIA to send the above communication since it is general and
contains only an implication of CIA information in informant's
possession.
WAGES was informed of information previously cleared
for passage and was told that informant had been instructed to
attempt during his next meet to subtly elicit from his case of-
ficer an instruction that informant write an account of his
former association with CIA.
It is recognized that if the above message is sent,
(U) informant must be prepared to reveal details of the plan of
MASFERRER to his Cuban case officer if he is contacted im-
mediately as anticipated. Therefore, on 10/10/66, Miami held

a discussion with STANLEY S. SCHACHTER, Enforcement Agent,
U. S. Customs, Miami, who is handling the MASFERRER case,
relative to the propriety of revealing complete information
regarding MASFERRER's plan to Cuba at this time. SCHACHTER
advised he could foresee no difficulties or objections on the
part of Customs to the furnishing of full information regarding
MASFERRER's activities to the CIS by an informant of this of-
(U) fice. SCHACHTER was also of the opinion that Cuba was no doubt
already aware of MASFERRER's activities inasmuch as most
active Cuban exiles in Miami know of his plan. SCHACHTER said
he felt this procedure would in no way interfere with Customs
investigation in this case.

Enclosed for the Bureau are the original and nine
copies of a letterhead memorandum setting forth proposed in-
formation to be related by informant to his Cuban contact
during any meeting scheduled as a follow-up on above letter
