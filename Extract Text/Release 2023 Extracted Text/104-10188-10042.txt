4) LIFEAT/Czechoslavakian LIFEAT is covering the home of two
Czechoslavakian intelligence officers in hopes of gataling operational leads
for the Interested Station officer,
5) LIFEAT/Cuba.a LIFEAT coverage of three lines in support of the
AMS FRUT operation continues to give an "essentlal" check on this operation
as well as providing by: product information on conditions in PBRUMEN.
Coptes of the processed take from these lines are forwarded twice a week
to WAVE, LIFEAT provides coverage of AMSTET-1, of great interest to
the Station's JMGIN officer, and prior to AMSTET-1's return to Mexico
provided coverage of the home of a Cuban official formerly stationed in
Mexico City.
6) LIFEAT/Exile In this area the coverage of ESLARD-1 plus three
related lines was the single major offort by LIFEAT during the reporting
period. This coverage included a week of "live monitoring" of these lines
prior to ESLARD-1's departure from Mexico, The Station officers interested
In this case described LIFEAT coverage as "excellent and sustained with
many operational leads".
LIFEAT coverage of a Costa Rican Communis: living in Mexico,
Judith FERRETO Segura, contains an unusual number of leads for use by the
Interested Station Case Officer,
7) LIFEAT/American Communists Coverage of targets in this area is
of primary interest to ODENVY. According to local ODENVY, travel and
contacts of the ACGM provided from the LIFEAT coverage is of particular
and continuing Interest to them.
8) LIFEAT/Miscellaneous LIFEAT is covering a former SMOTH agent
who is of Interest to KUBARK for possibly compromising both SMOTH and
KUBARK operations. The lead to this individual and reques: for LIFEAT
coverage originated from Headquarters, Also LIFEAT, In connection with
LIEMERACE, provided lengthy coverage of Francisco WALTZ Ollvera as a
result of a lead from the Station's LIJENNET operation. This lead ratsed the
possibility that WALTZ could have been a source of U.S. air navigational
materials for the Soviets. Coverage of WALTZ, however, tends to confirm
his non-involvement with the Soviets, at least during the period of LIEMBRACE-
LIFEAT coverage.
B. PROCESSING OF TAKE
Karen C, UTTLECKY was added on an availability basis to the processor
translator staff of LIFEAT. However, her primary duties continue to be that
of part time translator of general Station materials. No other changes have
taken place,
C. LIAISON
No change from tha: reported in reference.
D. SECURITY
During the reporting period, it has become increasingly difficult for
LIFEAT to operate in a number of areas in Mexico City tor two reasons:
1) the increasing efficiency of the telephone company (Telefonos de Mexico)
in both modernizing their telephone cable system and keeping track of their
dally personnel assignmeats (somewhat reducing the mobility of the two
LIFEAT linemen and one centralman), and 2) the assignment by the Secretaria
de Communicaciones y Obras Públicas (SCOP) of special crews to check all

Telephone company distributon boxes for "spare pairs" which could be used
to provide service to Mexico City residents now without telephones. It is
these "spare pairs" which LIFEAT utilizes for the routing of its tap lines to
the basehouses, LIFEAT personnel have succeeded in developing variacions
on their regular tap procedures watch it is believed will help negate the effects
of the dangers noted above, Further refinements of LIFEAT operating methods
are presently being considered, and will be implemented as necessary.
