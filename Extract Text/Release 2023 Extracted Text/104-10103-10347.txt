The Implications to the Power Alignments of Escalante's
Purge:
1. The purge of Anibal Escalante Dellunde, Executive
Secretary of the PSP from the position of
in the ORI did not create a "split"
between "new" and "old" communists.
2. Castro's reasons for purging Escalante were Almost
Certainly Aimed at:
a.
Reassuring those 26th of July leaders who
had fought for the revolution but not for
communism.

b. Putting the brakes on the PSP's grab
for power.
Castigating Escalante for personal
"sectarianism".

E. A New View on Splitting the Regime:
1.
:
Castro's purge of Escalante surfaced his
concern for the balance between the non-communist
elements of the 26th of July Movement and the
"unaligned" government leader and the PSP - "old"
and "new".
2. To split Castro from the PSP would be difficult
and of questionable value:.
a. The PSP to gain its final objective would
take any insult and turn the other cheek.
It had embraced Fidel and would not let go
under any circumstances. To rise against
Castro now would not be opportune, and
would probably be fatal.
b. Fidel was now totally dependent on the
Soviet Union
c.
The only hope was not to split Fidel from
PSP but to identify, at every opportunity,
him and his government with communism, for
only the non-communist element of the 26th
of July Movement and the "unalighed leaders

of the government could effectively be
:
split from the government.
This conclusion did not preclude the Task
Force from attempts to create suspicion,
hostility and friction between Castro and
the PSP.
II. The Direction of Task Force Efforts to Split the Regime:
A. To identify those members of the 26th of July Movement
and other "unaligned" government leaders who were for
the revolution but against communism. To date, there
is reasonably good evidence indicating that the
following individuals do not approve of the communist
direction of the Cuban revolution and may in fact
be conspiring against the regime.
1. Major Pedro Miret Prieto, commanding artillery unit
2.
3.
Ambassador Gustavo Arcos y Bergnes
Commander Sebastian Arcos, brother of Gustavo and
a commander in the Cuban havy. Has been in Prague
for some time on a training mission
!
4.
Orlando Ventura Reyes
5. Manuel Carbonell Duque
6. Major Faustino Perez, former minister charged with
the recovery of stolen properties

7.
Omar Fernandez Canizares, Minister of Transporte-
tion.
NOTE: Ambassador Gustavo Arcos is undoubtedly an
important member of this group of potential con-
spirators. TFW has made an unsuccessful but sustained
effort to recruit him in Brussels Despite our
failure to date, Arcos remains in close and friendly
contact with TFW sources.
Conspiring in Cuba today is dangerous business.
These are fearful men and neither easily identified
or easily contacted within Cuba.
Each of the above men remain as high priority targets
within. Our main efforts to contact them take two
directions: (1) The identification of suitable
intermediaries to them, and (2) the eventual use
of internal assets now in place.
8. Major Rolando Cubela Secades, ex-president of
the Federation of University Students. An M.D.,
recruited, trained and returned to Cuba after
attending the World Youth Festival in Helsinki
in June 1962.
9. Juanita Castro, younger sister of Fidel and
recruited, trained and returned to
Cuba.
10. Wife of Major Raul Jaime Diaz Arguelles.
Reporting from Havana through AMSTRUT/1, the
wife of the Brazilian Ambassador to Russia, who
travels to Cuba for TFW from Pi where she lives

by Juanita Castro
11. Raul Roa, Minister of Foreign Affairs. Effert
to contact and recruit in October 1962 failed.

of Mrs. Raul Roa He resides in Miami. TFW
is presently engaged in attempting to resettle
the parents of Mrs. Roa in the U.S. The departure
of the parents from Cuba will leave (Mrs. Roa s
the last member of her large family in Cuba.
This move of her parents could cause a final
break between the Roas, who are already in-
tensely concerned with their situation with
Cuba. Raul Roa remains a high priority target.
President Osvaldo Dorticos. An attempt to
recruit President Dorticos in October 1962 failed.
Dorticos was approached by a TFW asset in New
York during his last visit to the United Nations.
Our agent was "forcibly" removed from the
hotel where Dorticos was staying.
13. Jose Llanusa, Director of Sports in Cuba and one
time "Mayor" of Havana. Efforts to recruit
Llanusa in May 1962 failed; however, a total of
ten (10) Cuban athlets defected during the same
period of the 9th Central American and Carribean
games in Kingston, Jamaica.

14. Major Jose Ricardo Rabel Nunez, Chief of Rural
Housing in Cuba refused to work in place but
will defect.
Contact is maintained inside
Cuba. Rabel states he will fly out of Cuba
with a "fat one" (unidentified).
15. Alfred Davins Ferrer, a Spaniard hired to
recruit technicians for Cuban industry has
been recruited. He has recently returned to
Cuba. He claims to be close to "Che" Guevara
and Minister of National Economy, Regino Boti.
Davins may serve as an excellent mechanism for
the infiltration of TFW chosen technicians into
Cuba.
16. Mrs. Carlos Lechuga, wife of Carlos Lechuga
Hevia, Cuban Ambassador to the United Nations,
is expected to seek asylum and break with her
husband and Cuba toward the end of November
1962. Her "defection" has been the object of
TFW efforts since August 1962.3
