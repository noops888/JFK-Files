British Virgin Islands
:1
1. Although information received in October 1970 alleged
'that a new Black Power group known as "New World" existed in
the U.S. Virgin Islands, and that one chapter had been formed
in the British Virgin Islands, there has been no confirmation
of the existence of the group in either territory. Black
Power sympathizers undoubtedly exist in the British Virgin
Islands, but there is no reliable evidence so far that they
have organized themselves into a cohesive group to challenge
the present administration.
Dominica
:
2. The Black Power movement of Dominica published the
It
second issue of its magazine "Flambeau" on 21 November.
stressed the importance of moving out of the social, economic
and cultural norm to achieve Black identity. (British
Service Comment: The popularity of "Flambeau" may be accounted
for not so much by acceptance of its Black Power ideology,
as by the fact that it offers a different approach to reporting

from the other Dominica newspapers.) Black Power and
Cuban literature was received during November. (Headquarters
Comment: CSDB-312/00410-71 reported on the types of
Black Power literature received in Dominica.)
Grenada
3. Twenty-two nurses at the General Hospital in
St. George's staged a protest demonstration on 7 November
against conditions and the shortage of medical supplies.
The Premier and the government reacted strongly to the
allegations and suspended those who had protested. The
opposition Grenada National Party and the Black Power
organization, National Action Front (NAF), held meetings
in support of the nurses. The nurses' dispute continued
to escalate during December. (British Service Comment:
According to newspaper reports, on 15 December the police
used tear gas to eject a number of nurses and supporters who
had occupied the Ministry of Health, and 24 persons, including
Morris Bishop of the NAF, were arrested and charged
with assembling to commit riot.) A number of nurses were
charged on 16 December with assaulting the matron and
assistant matron of the hospital by imprisoning them in
the matron's office. (Headquarters Comment: Morris Bishop
may be identical with Maurice Bishop, reported in
CSDB-312/00419-71 and/or Michael Bishop, reported
in CSDB-312/02061-70.)
4. George Weekes, president-general of the
Trinidad Oilfield Workers' Trade Union and recently released
detainee, visited Grenada from 29 November to 3 December,
and had discussions with Ian Francis and Bishop of
the NAF, with the nurses involved in the dispute, and with
Michael Sylvester. (Headquarters Comment: Sylvester
is probably identical with the Michael Sylvester, a lawyer
who is opposed to the government, reported in CSDB-312/01656-70.)
Patrick Emmanuel, Grenadian lecturer at the
University of the West Indies, St. Augustine campus, and
detainee during the spring 1970 state of emergency in Trinidad,
visited Grenada during November and had discussions with
Francis and other Black Power advocates.
St. Kitts
5. Fitzroy Bryant, Minister of Education,
Health, and Welfare, and Lee Moore,. Public Relations
Officer to the Premier, held an "Educational Forum" on
"Youth and Its Aspirations" during October. Both are
advocates of Black Power.
St. Lucia
6. The St. Lucia government introduced two unpopular
bills into the House of Assembly during November; one vas
a proposed Retirement Allowance and Pensions Bill for
government ministers and other legislators, and the other
was a Teachers Service Commission Bill. The St. Lucia Forus
vehemently attacked the provisions of the Retirement
Allowance and Pensions Bill and organized two demonstrations
against it. The bill was not given a second reading... The
Teachers Service Commission Bill was the cause of strong
protest by the Catholic Church authorities who staged a
demonstration against it on 26 November. The opposition

St. Lucia Labor Party jumped at the chance of criticizing
the government and joined in the religious demonstration.
On 27 November, 280 primary school teachers stated a counter-
demonstration in favor of the bill. Forum managed to persuade
both sides to have further discussions, and as a result,
an amendment acceptable to both was made and the bill was
passed on 27 November.
