FROM MAINDARING
TELECON OF 9 SEPTEMBER 1976, SAME SUBJECT
1. FOR THE RECORD, THE PRIMARY PURPOSE FOR
REQUEST THAT I SEE HIM WAS TO ENABLE HIM TO REFER A POSSIBLE
APPLICANT FOR STAFF EMPLOYMENT TO THE AGENCY. I WILL INFORMALLY
RAISE THIS MATTER WITH THE PERSONNEL RECRUITER WHEN HE IS REXT
IN THE MIAMI FIELD OFFICE.
HAD NO PERSONAL INTEREST
IN THIS MATTER AND WAS SIMPLY TRYING TO PLAY THE ROLLE OF A HELPFUL
INDIVIDUAL.
2. HE ALSO REVIEWED SOME PROJECTS THAT HIS ORGNIZATION WILL
BE INVOLVED IN BOTH LATIN AMERICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST. AS OF
THIS DATE IT IS TO EARLY TO DETERMINE WHETHER WE MIGHT HAVE ANY
INTEREST IN THESE MATTERS. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE NO REPORTABLE INTEL
OR OPERATIONAL MATERIALS.
3.
ALSO DISCUSSED HIS COMPANY'S APPROACH TO EXECUTIVE
PROTECTION AGAINST THE THREAT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. THIS
MAY BE STILL ANOTHER AREA IN WHICH HE MIGHT OCCASIONALLY VOLUNTEER
A USEFUL ITEM.
4. AS NOTED EARLIER, SINCE HIS DECISION TO REFRAIN FROM ANY
LITIGATION INVOLVING THE AGENCY, HE SEEMS TOTALLY RELAXED MY
PERSONAL APPRAISAL NOW IS THAT HE WILL POSE NO PROBLEMS FOR US
IN THE FUTURE DESPITE THE UNPLEASANTNESS OF A FEW YEARS AGO.
