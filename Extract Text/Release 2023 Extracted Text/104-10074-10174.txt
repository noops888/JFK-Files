1. One of our sources in Miami, Joseph Merola, revealed
the name and position of an individual reported to be an Agency
official in El Salvador to Matt MacVane during the course of an
interview on 21 December 1973. This was reported in MIM-006-74
4 January 1974. This report was forwarded to the El Salvador
Desk on 8 January 1974. On 16 January 1974 the Desk requested
that DCD obtain the name of the individual mentioned in this
memorandum who said he knew a CIA officer in the Embassy. This
request was passed by telecon and TWX to MacVane by(Ryan on
16 January 1974. The El Salvador Desk also questioned the
reliability of our source, Joseph Meróla, at this time and
requested we query Miami as to his reliability.

2. On 17 January 1974 at the request of MacVane, Ryan
visited the El Salvador Desk to ascertain their objections to
our source, known to us as a convicted felon. Desk objections
stemmed from a 1964 report which indicated that Merola had
informed persons that he was a "CIA agent". Further conversa-
tion elicited the fact that Merola had again made this state-
ment in 1973 at an Embassy function. We advised the Desk that
DCD was well aware of Merola's criminal background but that he
had provided DCD with reliable reports in the past unrelated
to his own "pursuits".
3. The El Salvador desk confirmed the fact that the
individual mentioned by Merola's informant as being a CIA
officer was in fact such. Ryan advised. Mac Vane of this per
telecon on 17 January 1974. 'MacVane and Mainwaring told Ryan
they were sending two cables relating to this case The first
would provide the name of the person who reportedly knew the
CIA official The second provided the names of two women
employed in the Embassy who were reportedly involved in

This latter cable was requested after the El Salvador desk
officer advised that all avenues and possible leads were to be
pursued
sued to determine who leaked the information relating to the
CIA official. These two names (phonetically spelled) were
provided in the second cable by Miami. All of the information
received in these cables was passed via secure phone to the
El Salvador desk by Ryan) upon receipt.

4. MacVane advised (Ryan) via telecon that he anticipated
meeting with Joseph Merola at 1400 on 17 January to address 3
further matters concerned with this case. MacVane advised Ryan
that he would forward such information as soon as possible.
