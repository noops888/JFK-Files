SECRET
19 January 1965
MEMORANDUM FOR:
CI/OA
SUBJECT:
LICOOFY-1
(201-278841)
REFERENCES:
A. Memo dated 24 June 1964.
B. Memo dated 22 July 1964.
Per telephone conversation of 18 January between Mr.
of your office and Miss Zerance of WH/1 we wish to
again request an amendment to LICOOFY-1's Operational Approval
to include her utilization as an access agent against a Soviet
Press Attach√© and Soviet Information Bulletin representative.
This request for amendment was previously approved on 26 June
1964 but was never implemented since the Soviet targets visit
to Mexico City never materialized. On 13 January we were
notified that the Soviets will now be coming to Mexico City
and that the Station would once again want to utilize
LICOOFY-1 in the access agent capacity.
V. J. Kaufman
Chief, WH/1
