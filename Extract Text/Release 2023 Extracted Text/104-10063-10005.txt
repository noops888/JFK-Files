APPENDIX 16
In early 1967, BROSE received a Canada Council grant for research
on Mexican politics and, in the fall of 1967, visited Cuba.
BROSE, one of the first exponents of academic freedom and tenure
of appointments at SFU, was a key spokesman during the CAUT censure
of the SFU administration issue. He supported the radical group's
attempts to push faculty demands on academic and administration
matters to the extreme.
Leroy Roger BUTCHER
-
student, SGWU
BUTCHER, a West Indian and a member of the SGWU
Caribbean Students Society, attended the Black University Conference
(BUC) at Howard University, Washington, on 13 to 17 November 1968
where he stated that only by working together would Black people
achieve their objective - total liberation, black nationality and
black identity. BUTCHER was elected Chairman of the International
Black Student Union organized at the BUC and plans were made for the
Union to operate in every university in the Western Hemisphere.
was following BUTCHER's return to Montreal that the Black Students
Association was organized. BUTCHER was one of the key leaders
during the occupation of the Computer Centre at SGWU and was one
of those arrested during the riot.
Sidney COONTZ Associate Professor, SFU
J
COONTZ, a U.S.A. citizen who was granted landed
immigrant status in Canada in 1966, became an Associate Professor
of Mathematics at SFU in January 1968. COONTZ has a history of
Communist involvement which, although sporadic, dates back to the
1930's.
Laughlin Bernard CURRIE
-
Professor, SFU.
It
CURRIE, formerly an American citizen, was implicated as a
Communist fellow traveller in the mid-1940 espionage trials in the
United States and subsequently went to Colombia where he took out
citizenship. Following this, in May 1967, he came to Canada and
has since obtained landed immigrant status. CURRIE was responsible
for interviewing and recommending Maurice HALPERIN, described below,
for a position at SFU and purposefully played down HALPERIN'S
Marxist leanings, claiming that HALPERIN had been a victim of cir-"
cumstances.

Kennedy Jerome FREDERICK
-
student, SGWU
APPENDIX 16
C
E
FREDERICK, a West Indian, arrived in Canada in August
1967 to attend university at SGWU. FREDERICK is a member of the
militant Negro movement at the University and advocates violence.
He is considered by some parties to be extremely dangerous and
capable of drastic actions. He was active in organizing the
occupation of the Computer Center at SGwU and was one of those
arrested during the riot.
Maurice HALPERIN
-
Professor, SFU
:
HALPERIN was born on 3 March 1906 at Boston, Massachusetts
33
and entered Canada in the spring of 1968. In late 1953 he left the
United States for Mexico in order to avoid testifying before a
United States Senate internal sub-committee. In 1958, when the
Mexican Government began deporting United States Communists,
HALPERIN went to the Soviet Union, and became a visiting professor
at the ০.১.১.r. Academy of Sciences. He went to Cuba in October
ly62 as a professor of Economy at the University of Havana, where
he remained employed until coming to Canada. He is currently
employed with the Faculty of Education, Behavioural Science
Foundation, at Simon Fraser University. As noted above, Laughlin
Bernard CURRIE lobbied very hard to have HALPERIN accepted by
Simon Fraser University. CURRIE was aware of HALPERIN's background
and "watered it down" to get him the appointment.
Of particular interest in this case is the fact that
CURRIE and HALPERIN were associated with the same espionage group
in the United States. His application for landed status was the
subject of an objection by the RCMP and, as yet, no final decision
has been made by the Minister of Immigration.
Alfred Alan HERZOG
-
graduate student, McGill University
HERZOG, a U.S.A. citizen, travelled to several Canadian
university campuses with Robert CRUISE, a leader of the Inter-
nationalists (pro-Chinese Communist), in their promotion of the
Canadian Student Movement. He is a member of the Intellectual
and Patriotic workers of Quebec (les Intellectuels et Ouvriers
Patriotes du Quebec - IOPQ), was involved in the occupation of SGWU
in February 1969 and is a close associate of the leader of the
Internationalists H.S. BAINS (see APPENDIX 14).

activists¹
,
!
of the SDU at SFU, consists of left-wing activists in this
category. Martin LONEY, who was one of the student leaders.
during the SFU incident, entered Canada as a British citizen in
August 1966. Dr. Thomas Burton BOTTOMORE a leading Marxist
and author on Marxism as well as a British citizen, took up
employment at SFU in 1965 as head of the Department of Political
Science, Sociology and Anthropology (PSA). BOTTOMORE, as head of
the PSA, was responsible for the hiring of Kathleen ABERLE, a
British citizen, and of Thomas Harold BROSE, John William Carl
LEGGETT, Nathan POPKIN and Martin NICOLAUS, all U.S. citizens.
Although the largest concentration of foreign radicals
at SFU was in the PSA, other activists did take positions in
other departments. These included Sidney COONTZ, Michael Allan
LEBOWITZ, Paul Edward IVORY, and Maurice HALPERIN, all U.S.
citizens, and Laughlin Bernard CURRIE, a citizen of Colombia.
Mordecai BRIEMBERG, who took over as head of the PSA
Department after BOTTOMORE tendered his resignation in 1967, has
expressed a desire to remain as Department head in order to keep
his hand in on the hiring. In this regard, Gerald SPERLING is,
through BRIEMBERG, making efforts to get Malcolm SYLVERS, an American
Marxist university professor who apparently worked for the Communist
underground in Italy during the early 1960's, into SFU.
Professor Donald E. EPSTEIN of the Political Science
Department at the University of Waterloo, an American citizen
described as a draft dodger and an SDS member prior to his arrival
in Canada in 1967, as previously indicated, has been active in
organizing and directing students in tactics and methods by which
they could take physical possession of university buildings.
EPSTEIN, who has been active in student power activities at
Waterloo, has apparently been refused tenure at that University
and there are indications that activist students intend to challenge
the administration in this regard.
2 Professor Norman STRAX, an American who was employed
as an Assistant Professor of Physics at the University of New
Brunswick, precipitated the crisis at that University. STRAX was
instrumental in the formation and activities of the SDS branch at
that point.3
