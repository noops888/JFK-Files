ATTACKS AGAINST THE FBI
FILE (80-10)
As shown in my memorandum of 12-13-77, the Bureau
identified some of the materials in the KENNEDY investigation
which were released on 12-7-77 as those which apparently
attracted the attention of at least one reporter from a
Mexican newspaper in Washington. Mr. ROBERT DUNN, the
Ambassador's Assistant, was in Washington the following
weekend and brought back with him three separate sections
which had been furnished to him at the Bureau. These sections
represent the 524 page report of former SA WARREN C. DE
BRUEYS at Dallas on 12-8-63. One section, pages 315 359,
relates to the Mexican travel of LEE HARVEY OSWALD. To date,
there have been no articles of a sensational nature appearing
in the Mexican press based on this material.
(U)
In addition, on 1-5-78, Mr. BOB BERG, SRF, brought
to this office a set of documents which had been forwarded
by his Headquarters which appeared to represent raw Bureau
file material pertaining to the Mexican aspects of the OSWALD
investigation. At his suggestion, copies of thesedocuments
were made for temporary retention in the files of this office
and the set furnished by BERG was returned to him on 1-6-78.

For the time being, all of this material is being
placed in a Bulky Exhibit Envelope of captioned file so
that it will be available for reference if needed.
