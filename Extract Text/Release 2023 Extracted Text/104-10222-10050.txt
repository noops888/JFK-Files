Filek
(Flick's performance has been consistently evaluated at
strong to outstanding level. His many rating officers over the
years have each reached the conclusion that it would be all but
impossible to find a replacement that would be able to deal with
all aspects of his job as well as Flicky some concluded that Flick
was irreplaceable (Flick has successfully maintained a high-
level rapport and an excellent working relationship with the (COM 24
officials concerned with the intercept center's operation for
24(liirteen years a unique achievement in itself - despite
03
circumstances that would not have been tolerated by others of
lesser ability and dedication. Through personal initiative and
perseverance (Flick has enabled the Agency to accrue substantial
savings of funds by maintaining obsolete equipment in excellent
operating condition. Because of Flick's exceptional capabilities.
and efforts, the center achieved an outstanding record of on-line
time and production despite the age and condition of the equipment
and facilities available. By consistent application of diligent
and unselfish professional effort (Flich turned a relatively
routine technical assignment into a highly productive joint 24
operation of sustained operational and intelligence production
value to the Station and to the Agency. "
203.1
In summary, Mr. (Flick) has performed his duties at the
telephone intercept center in Mexico City for the (past thirteen) 24
years in a truly dedicated, professional, and outstanding manner.
This outstanding performance of duty over such an extended
period of time is a credit to Mr.Flick and certainly worthy of
the award recommended herein as he retires from the Agency.
