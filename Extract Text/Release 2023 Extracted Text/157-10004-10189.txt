1. IN THE FACE OF MOUNTING EVIDENCE THAT ALVARADO IS FABRICATING HIS
STORY OF SEEING OSWALD TAKE MONEY IN THE CUBAN EMBASSY, URGE YOU FOLLOW
UP WITH HIS LOCAL NIC CASE OFFICER AND AVAIL YOURSELF OF THE HELP OF THE
NIC SERVICE, WHICH CAN SEND ERTHYROID 3, AK GOOD, KUBARK ASSET TO HELP
IN THE INTERROGATION. WE FIND IT INCREDIBLE THAT THE CUBANS WOULD
BRIEF AND PAY AN ASSASSIN IN FRONT OF A NIC INTERLOPER. WE THINK IT
POSSIBLE OR EVEN LIKELY THAT HE HAS BEEN IN AND OUT OF THE CUBAN ENBASSY
AS A NIC AGENT TRYING TO INFILTRATE CUBA AND HAS PICKED UP THE NAMES AND
FACES THERE IN SO DOING. ALL HE HAS SAID ABOUT OSWALD HE COULD HAVE
GOTTEN FROM THE NEWSPAPERS, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN INCORRECT ITEMS SUCH AS
HIS STATEMENT THAT OSWALD WORE GLASSES.
2. THE FACT THAT ALVARADO IS A CALM, NICE, AND INTELLIGENT YOUNG MAN
DOES NOT MEAN HE IS NOT A FABRICATOR. FYI WE AND OTHER AGENCIES ARE
BEING FLODDED BY FABRICATIONS ON THE GPFLOOR CASE FROM SEVERAL CONTINENTS
SOME ORIGINATING WITH PEOPLE ON THE FRINGES OF THE INTELLIGENCE BUSINESS.
SUCH FABRICATIONS ARE NOT USUALLY DONE FOR MONEY, BUT OUT OF SICKLY
FANCY AND A DESIRE TO GET INTO THE INTELLIGENCE GAME.
3. WE DO NOT THINK IT A REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE THAT BOTH DORTICOS AND
ALVARADO TALK ABOUT MONEY PAID TO OSWALD. FOR ONE THING, PAY FOR AN
ASSASSIN IS A FACTOR WHICH IMMEDIATELY RISES IN THE MIND OF EXPERT AND
LAYMAN ALIKE. SECONDLY, DORTICOS MAY HAVE HEARD THROUGH SOME RUSSIAN
OR CUBAN SOURCE IN THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT THAT DURAN WAS ASKED WHETHER
THE CUBANS PAID OSWALD FOR THE ALLEGED ASSIGNMENT.
4. WHILE WE DO NOT INSIST THAT ALVARADO'S STORY IS BEYOND ALL BELIEF
WE DO URGE THAT MEXI PLACE IT AND ALVARADO UNDER THE MOST SEARCHING
SCRUTINY. HIS INTERROGATORS MUST PROBE DEEPLY INTO HIS MAKE-UP AND
LEAD HIM BACK THROUGH THE THROUGHT PRECESSES WHICH MAY HAVE LED HIM TO
MAKE THIS POSSIELE MIS-STEP. IN SECURING CONFESSIONS OF FAPRICATION,
A SYMPATHETIC ATTITUDE, STRESSING AWARENESS OF THE SEVERE MENTAL STRAIN
THE SUBJECT MUST BE UNDER, AND WITH GENEROUS RECOGNITION OF HIS "BASIC-
ALLY FINE MOTIVATION," COUPLED WITH PROMISES OF FACE-SAVING SECRECT,
AND EVEN SPICIOUS HOPES OF "USEFUL" FUTURE COOPERATION ARE OFTEN EFFEC-
TIVE. HOURS MUST BE DEVOTED TO THESE TACTICS.
DEORE JUST RECEIVED MENI 7107. CONCUR THAT LEND ALL ASSIST-
AALAND INDUCENIC SERVICE TO COOPERATE. THINK THERE IS JUST NO
POSSIBILITY THAT THIS IS A NIC FRAM-UP, PUT HOPE NIC COOPERATION VILL
