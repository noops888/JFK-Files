Appraisal of Contents 3.
1. Anti-Castro activities in Cuba include those of the nation-wide organised
movements and those of local fronts where independent guerrillas are grouped
in small units. The penetration of the Cuban armed forces is insignificant.
2. The national movements which have been active in Cuba are the Movimiento de
Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MER), Movimiento Democrata Cristiano (MDC),
Movimiento Revolucionario 30 de Noviembre, Movimiento Revolucionario del
Pueblo. (MRP) Rescate Revolucionario, and Directorio Revolucionario
Estudiantil (DRR). Other groups with limited organizations are the Unidad
Revolucionaria and the ARA. (socissima. de Atigos de Aureliano Sanches
Arango). The strength of the groups by province, is as follows:
a. Southern Oriente Province (Santiago de Cuba)
(1) MRR. The MRR, of Nino Dias, has members from the ranks of the
26 of July Movement and, especially, from the former regular Army.
Its civilian organization is poor, almost non-existent. The men
remain inactive, waiting for a serious military action of a local
or national character.

(2) MDC. The MDC has an adequate civilian organisation; from the
founding of the movement Santiago de Cuba has been one of its
strongholds. The military organization is extremely poor. Many
of its leaders have gone into exile or are trying to do so..
They remain totally inactive in hope of an invasion which will resolve
the situation, and only concern themselves about a future political
life, at the time when the present government falls.
(3) 30 de Noviembre. There are few members of the 30 de Noviembre in
Santiago de Cuba, and they lack contact with their national leaders.
They have practically no resources.

(4) MRP. Until October 1961 the MRP had a good civilian and military organization.
However, after the arrest of Winol Gonzalez, the national co-ordinator, the
local co-ordinator and almost all the members in the province sought asylum.
The new co-ordinator is trying to reorganize the movement. There are still
enough men of action, coming from the 26 of July movement, but they have to
establish contacts.
(5) Rescate. Rescate has no members in this area.
(6) DRE. The DRE was completely broken by the unsuccessful uprising of Alberto Muller
and by the arrest in October of "El Fiera", provincial co-ordinator. The DRB
still has great prestige in the area, and there are many who would follow its
direction.
b. Northern Oriente Province
(1) MRR. The MRR is practically non-existent in northern Oriente Province,
with the exception of a few personal contacts of Nino Dias.
(2) MDC. The MDC is poorly organized and inactive.
(3) 30 de Noviembre. It has a mediocre organization, few members, and is
inactive.
(4) MRP. Even before the debacle of October the MRP had a very poor
organization in this area. Fito Comes ("Ricardo"), the co-ordinator,
was arrested in the roundup at that time, but escaped and took asylum
in the Ecuadorean Embassy. His successor and the military and civilian
personnel are relatively capable.
(5) Rescate. It does not exist in this area.
(6) DRE. It does not exist in this area.
c. Camaguey Province.
(1) MRR. At the beginning of April 1961 Caballero (fon), the co-ordinator,
whose nickname is "El Viejo", was arrested and condemned to 30 years
on the Isle of Pines. Arango (from), who was named co-ordinator in
August, has been forced to seek asylum in Habana. The movement has
been destroyed.
(2) MDC. The MDC has an excellent co-ordinator, Blanco (fra), who is
responsible, discreet, with good connections. The MDC has a very good
civilian organization and at present is concerned about its military
organization, for which they already have some personnel. They work
effectively and are trying to carry out some military actions.
(3) 30 de Noviembre. The civilian organization is relatively good. It has
a small but effective military force.
(4) MRP. Camaguey is practically the only province in which the MRP was not
affected by the arrests of October. It has a good civilian organisation
and military forces of importance, which are under the command of former
officers of the Rebel Army. Arquimides Caballero ("Esteban"), its
former co-ordinator, took asylum in the Brazilian Embassy; "Ricardo",
his replacement, is very young (21 years old) but is considered very good.
(5) Rescate. It has a poor organization. There are enough men, but they
are inactive.
(6) DRE. Few members of the DRE remain, and "Tronco" and Rafael Angel Quevedo,
its directors, are known by U.S. The movement has been destroyed.
