BEFRIENDED
3. NIKONOV IS THE GRANDSON OF FORMER SOVIET FOREIGN
MINISTER VYACHESLAV MOLOTOV.
STATE
AT
NIKONOV WAS REGARDED AS EXTREMELY INTELLIGENT AND
CAPABLE BUT GAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS AN IDEOLOGICAL
HARDLINER.
BELIEVED THAT HE WAS LIKELY TO BE A
RISING STAR IN THE SOVIET SYSTEM AND RECOMMENDED HIM FOR AN
IREX-SPONSORED VISIT TO THE U.S. AS EXPECTED, NIKONOV'S VIEWS
AND RHETORIC MODERATED VERY VISIBLY AFTER HIS FIRST DIRECT
EXPOSURE TO THE U.S. HE HAS HAD AT LEAST ONE ADDITIONAL
IREX-SPONSORED TRIP TO THE U.S. AND HAS SPENT PERIODS OF TIME
AS A PERSONAL GUEST AT THE HOME OF
4. ΝΙΚΟΝOV CAME TO WORK IN HIS POSITION AT THE KGB AS A
RESULT OF BEING A CLOSE FRIEND OF BAKATIN. DURING THE AUGUST
1991 COUP ATTEMPT NIKONOV SAID THAT HE REFUSED TO FOLLOW HIS
BOSS'S ORDER TO ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DECLARED STATE OF
EMERGENCY. HE WAS DISMISSED BY HIS BOSS (NFI) FROM THIS
POSITION AND CALLED BAKATIN TO SEEK ADVICE. BAKATIN SAID HE
WAS ALSO OPPOSING THE COUP AND WOULD LOOK OUT FOR NIKONOV ONCE
ORDER WAS RESTORED. SOON AFTER THE COUP BAKATIN CALLED HIM TO
ASK THAT HE ASSIST WITH RESTRUCTURING THE KGB. AFTER IT WAS
AGREED THAT NIKONOV COULD DECLINE TO ACCEPT TWO-STAR MILITARY
KGB RANK AND WORK IN THE JOB FOR AN EQUIVALENT CIVILIAN
COMPENSATION PACKAGE, HE CAME TO THE KGB AS BAKATIN'S DEPUTY.
NIKONOV SAID HIS FRIENDS WERE DELIGHTED THAT HE HAD DECLINED
THE KGB COMMISSION.

WHICH MIGHT BE RAISED, NIKONOV PERSONALLY REVIEWED KGB FILES TO
DETERMINE IF LEE HARVEY ((OSWALD)) HAD BEEN A KGB AGENT. HE
REVIEWED FIVE THICK VOLUMES OF FILES ON OSWALD. NIKONOV IS NOW
CONFIDENT THAT OSWALD WAS AT NO TIME AN AGENT CONTROLLED BY THE
KGB. FROM THE DESCRIPTION OF OSWALD IN THE FILES HE DOUBTED
THAT ANYONE COULD CONTROL OSWALD, BUT NOTED THAT THE KBG
WATCHED HIM CLOSELY AND CONSTANTLY WHILE HE WAS IN THE USSR.
HE COMMENTED THAT OSWALD HAD A STORMY RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS
SOVIET WIFE, WHO RODE HIM INCESSANTLY. THE FILE ALSO REFLECTED
THAT OSWALD WAS A POOR SHOT WHEN HE TRIED TARGET FIRING IN THE
USSR.
6. IN PREPARATION FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF A
A. NIKONOV
PERSONALLY PERFORMED AN INQUIRY FOR BAKATIN INTO THE FATE OF
SWEDISH DIPLOMAT RAOUL ((WALLENBERG)). THERE IS STILL PRESSURE
FROM THE SWEDISH SIDE TO HAVE A DEFINITIVE ANSWER ON THIS
MATTER BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUING IMPORTANCE OF THE WALLENBERG
FAMILY. NIKONOV WAS AMAZED TO FIND OUT THAT THE KG3 HAD NOT
BEEN ABLE TO PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISH WHETHER WALLENBERG HAD DIED
AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES. HE WAS ABLE TO FIND PARTIAL
EVIDENCE FROM FOURTEEN DIFFERENT SOURCES (NF:). NIKONOV NOW
BELIEVES, BUT FOUND NO CONCLUSIVE PROOF, THAT WALLENBERG WAS
EXECUTED LATE IN 1947. THERE WERE INDICATIONS THAT WALLENBERG
WAS SUSPECTED OF HAVING CONTACTS WITH OTHERS WHO WERE ACCUSED
OF PROVIDING FALSE DIPLOMATIC IDENTITY DOCUMENTS TO OTHERS
BEYOND JEWS SAVED FROM THE HOLOCAUST. AMONG THESE WERE NAZI
WAR CRIMINALS WHO WERE ALLOWED TO ESCAPE. THERE WAS NO PROOF
OF WALLENBERG'S GUILT IN ANY OF THESE CHARGES.
