1. There appears to be two cover problems involved in the LIPSTICK/LIT
operation. These are, the physical cover of the base of operations and
the personal cover of LITICE-14, the principal agent. Headquarters
agrees that there would be more security attached to the physical cover
if it had a legitimate business front. It is not tolloved, however, that
at this stage the physical cover would be improved by suddenly opening up
an agriculture implement accessary supply houso there, presuming that
the sise and location of the base house wore feasible for such a business.
The involvement of LIPSTICK-19 and David N. Wilsted in the operation, as
suggested under this business cover arrangemont, could conceivably affect the
compartoontation of the LIPSTICK operation, which, os the Station has
pointed out, has been maintained with considerable difficulty.
2. Iloadquarters does not feel that the situation to us critical as exprossed by
the Station because of the question asked of LIVE TOOK-2 by his Coviet
contact. it appears most natural for the Soviets to auspect, particularly
in this Kesisphere, that they are being subjected to photo-raphic as well
as all'other types of surveillance. Being alerted to Luis action they would
naturally like to know more about it. Any new activity spotted at the
LIPSTICK/LIMITED base house would only increase this clertness and crouce
their suspucions. These suspicions would be further aggravated by the
employment of a motor car at the LIPSTICK/LIMITED tase house mere up to
this time no car has been in uso. Headquarters does not agreu that a car
is needed in the day to day sork of this operation. If one were employed
it would only further spot light the love house for the Coriets. In
addition, it is not clear just who would be using the automobile since
LIPSTICK-14 presumably need not cover his own access to the premises
SEOMET

and no other personnel will be visiting the house on a regular basis.
4. If at the inception of the LIPSTICK/LIMITED operation a legitimate
business cover had been set up it would have toen more secure than tho
present arrangonent. Ihless some natural and non-suspicious arousing cover
can be worked out Headquarters foels that it is more secure to continue
the operation under the present arrangement than to set up the business
cover suggested in A-3797.
5. The problem of the personal cover for LIPSTICK-LA can best to solved by a
salary incresse for the arent. As the Station has already pointed out,
LIPSTICK-L's salary of 200 pesos por month is well balow the salaries
earned by agents porferndar comparable duties. In view of this ami sa
a reward for LIPSTILA-L's good worit and an incentive for improvozent
Headquarters authorises last bo be paid a salary of 1500 pesos per month
effective 1 January 1956.

1. LIPSTICK-14 and his family occupied the LIPSTICK/LIMITED base house
on 4 November 1955. On 10 November 1955 Howard O. MOSGIIANO was picked
up by LIPSTICK-lh in a rented car and driven into the baso, MSCHIANO
stayed with LIPSTICK- that entire day instructing him in photographic
technique ant taking approximately 200 pictures. The appearance of the
house during this tire of operation was checked by the uniorsigned and
Chester D. FOLLICOVE who were unable to discover any outward indications
of the existence of the photographic surveillance. LIPSTICK-la has con-
tinued to improve although the quantity has decreased on our instructions.
It was decidou that it would be to our ultimate advantage to have fewer
photographs and havo LIPSTICK-L continue to conduct his normal house-to-
house book business for cover purpрозея.
2. Initially all files were processed in the Station so that 10SCITALO
could process than to the fullest advantage and then critique them with
LIVSTICK-LA. How the proceduro employed is to have POLLICOVE pick up the
Alms from LIPSTICK-14 and give them to James . AYCRL who processes them
and returns them to ILLICOVE for transmittal to the office for identifi-
cation, indexing and filing by HOSGILAND. This procedure was adopted
because AYCALL was aware of the existance of this oporation ani know LIP-
STICK-14 was employed by this Station, but LIPSTICK-14 does not ow that
AYGALL is employed by tois Station. The photographic results of this
operation will be transmitted to ileadquarters in subsequen: dispatares.
3.
The sitiation at present seams to be progressing in a most satisfactory
manner with the one oxception of believable and adequate cover. Reference
discussed the cover situation and raised several points which will be sub-
soquently discussed in this dispatc:. Initially, it may be sata that a
detailed Dun & Bradstreet investigation of the oxygen supply business in
Noxico City conducted by LIFINGER and other factors definitely eliminates

this potential cover from consideration. (Copy attacted as Attachment No. 1)
When the undersined discussed this possible cover at headquarters he
based is statements upon the assurances of LIMOUSINE o had considerably
overai plified the situation. To obtal cover from a relative of one of
the LIPSTICK team who would use the premises rant Free far is business and
thus supply cover is not viowed with favor by this Station. First, we have
gone to considerable difficulty to compartment is operation from every
member of the LIPSTICK team. Purther, arai in realit, the principal reason
for our inability to implecent implement headquarters headquart suggestion, is that there is
no one in the presort complex cio fills the requirements.
4. It should be repeated for emphasis that this operation needs some form
of business cover to continue to Ninction securely. In searching for all
possible solutions to this problem ve queried David M. NILSTED who sugested
to us what wo feel is the very test possible solution available. Die
conduct of a cover business should conform as closely as possible to a
lgitimate business. In order to aviduct the business as close to this
ideal as possible there must be a correlation between the degree of success
and the degree of business experience and acuren possessed by those in
charge of the business, Since the caskined business experience of the
officers of this Station could not guarantee the successful conduct of
a business; it logically behooves us to have the business conducted by
someone who is skilled and experienced in the daily direction of a business
and who has proven himself successful in this respect.
5. LIPSTICK-19 has such a background aral would be willing to assist us
in this operation. (In regard to his business experience and success,
the many documents submitted in support of David N. WILSTED's promotion
and cover situation should be corsulted.) It should also be remembered
that he is a cleared agent in win this Station reposes considerable con-
fidonce which has beer completely justified by his devoted and conscientious
work. LIPSTICK-19 would be assisted in the conduct of this business by
David M. WILSTED who is also experienced in the conduct of business in
Mexico City. There would not, however, be any breakiown of compartmentation
since LISTICK-llh is known by, ani in turn knows. LIPSTICK-19. WILSTED,
who is not known to LIPSTICK-14 but who knows of the existence of LIPSTICK -
14, would remain protected by LIESTICK-19 who would act as the only opera-
tional contact with LIPSTICK-1L.
6. The plan is that this Station should open an agricultural implement
accessory supply house at the LITICS/LIMITED base house. Physically,
the building is ideally suited to this type of business. LIPSTICK-19 and
his company would conduct all of the paper work and importing procedures
for the new company either in the name of the new ompany or the name of
LIPSTICK-19's company. Die new cospary under the ostensible leadership..
of LINDRICK-14 would sell the agricultural accessories to customers recom-
mended to it by LISTICK-19's company ani other agricultural implement
manfacturers. Further, and the greatest guarantee of succes is that
LIPSTICK-19's company itself can absorb the entire inventory of the new
SECRET
company operation at a profit. There is no comparable business existing
in Mexico City. LIPSTICK-19 a.d. David M. WIISTED would have started ore
but the expansion of tacir present holings has preciated their investing
the required sun of money in an inventory. They as, However, in the coarse
of a year use the amount of merchandise noted in the attaciod prospectus
(Attachment No. 2) and have agreed to purchase the amount listed in the
attachent at a price which warantees a profit to this Station. This will
insure that the business will to completely self-supporting. We have been
advised that these agricultural accessories are imported into Mexico and
sold at 40% alove the sum of the entire cost of initial purchase price plus
import costs and duties. The aricultural accessories would be sold to
the general public at a price determined by demand and competition, attempting
in every instance to make the most from eaa, sale. LIPSTICK-19, however,
would be allowed to puraiase tacse accessories at a price watch would com
pensato in for his time and effort in hanilin; all the ordering, importing
and other duties connected with hdcoment of the business.
covert
7. It is earnestly recommended that this proposal te accepted since it
represents a genuine long-term cover mechanism that will not only provide
secure believable cover for LIPSTICK/LIMITED but waich may conceivably to
used as cover for other personnel and operations.
8.
Information was ottaired on 28 November 1955 from LIVESTUCK-2 which

50-120-5-15
These men are generally well-regarded.
OPERATING METHODS
The business which consists of the sale and renting of oxigen equipment
to private persons, private and official sanatoriums is carried on a
strictly cash basis. The firm is supplied by factories and local
distributors on a cash and also on a term basis.
The firm occupies the ground floor of a modern building owned by the
Barquera brothers. The facilities are of good presentation and much
activity is noted on the premises.
The business is located in a residential area in Colonia del Valle.
The firm has five, small, Dodge trucks and one Fargo truck, which are
radio equipped. The firm has a radio transmitter to maintain contact
with its mobile units.
Financial Report
Luis Gonzalez Barquera was interviewed on the above date and he stated that
the business was operating on an active capital of $325,000 pesos, largely
tied up in equipment, merchandise and their delivery vehicles, radio
transmitters, furniture, fixtures, and bank deposits. The firms liabilities
are modest.
Gonzalez stated that his brother and he are co-owners of the building
which occupies 339 square meters. The building is evaluated at
approximately $370,000 pesos, having a mortgage of $72,000.00 Mexcy.
The bothers also own a Hercury and an HG which are valued at approximately
$72,000.00 pesos. Annual sales are estimated at $600,000.00 Mexcy.
This last statement was not completely substantiated by the persons
consulted but it is believed that their approximate financial status
is as stated. Those consulted stated the the present financial status
of the firm is considered satisfactory as the volume of sales permits
a normal development of the firm.

POTENTIAL ANT ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ACCESSORIES BUSINESS TOR
FARMING INFLAKENTS
In pointing out the potential of an accessories businees
for farming implements in Mexico, it is necessary to consider the
following:
a) Of the total of ideal farming lands only a 33% is now under mech-
anized cultivation and according to statistics obtained by Ford
Loter Company of Mexico, there has been an increase of 25% in the
total number of tractors in the country in the past 5 years which
indicates that the use of farming implements not only is just begin-
ning but also that there is a definite trend to further develop
their use
b) The present Government has shown great interest towards encour-
aging mechanized farming by establishing agricultural banks through-
out the country that finance farmers for the purpose of purchasing
tractors and implements on easy terms. Recently, several schools
have been established for the teaching of the operation and mainten-
ance of tracters and implements and of the modern techniques of
mechanized farming.
Identity A
c) Sven though most makes of U.S. tractors and implements are now
in use throughout the country, there are several suropean-made
tractors which are becoming extremely popular but are supplied by
