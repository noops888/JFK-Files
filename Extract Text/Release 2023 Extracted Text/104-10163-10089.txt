Nicaragua - Feb 66 and late 1965
THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION
Cuban national, a medical doctor, who resides in exile in the US. Since:
1962, he has been associated with active anti-GOC organizations in the
US and throughout Latin America.
(This report was developed by an Army representative assigned to the office
of preparation.)
1. Late in 1965, General Anastacio Somoza, Director, National Guard of Nicaragua,
was a patient in Baltimore's John Hopkins Hospital for approximately one
month. I visited the General at the hospital in two occasions and was
appalled at his appearance; he was a very sick man. He was suffering
from hepatitis and had had a nervous breakdown. As part of the treatment,
he was placed on a very strict diet, and advised to stop drinking. Presently,
Somoza is following the diet religiously; he takes a sugar substitute
with his coffee, and has drastically curtailed his drinking. Apparently
the diet has been successful, for Somoza has lost much weight.
2. In February 1966, I visited Nicaragua and called on General Somoza on a
business matter. He appeared healty, strong and was in jovial spiritu.
We discussed politics, and his presidential candidacy for next years elac-
tions. He is confident about the outcome of the elections; there is no
doubt in his mind that he will be the next President of Nicaragua.
3. In my opinion, behind the confidence and optimism is the nagging fact
that the Somosa name is automatically identified with dictatorships. He
would like to change the image the Somoza name has created throughout
Latin America. This is his real motivation in seeking the presidency, and
abandoning the directorship of the National Guard. He rejoices in the
fact that President Shick, a duly elected president, will serve his full
term and will be succeeded by another elected president. Somoza has all
intentions of stepping aside at the end of his term in favor of the then
elected president. He desires the Somoza name to be synonym of prosperity,
stability and democracy in Nicaragua.
