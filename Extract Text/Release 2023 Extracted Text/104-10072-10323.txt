10. Mundo Americano is completely under the control of
BATISTA oriented groups and its articles and editorials fol-
low the line dictated by these groups. The newspaper attacks
the U.S. Government, and especially the CIA, daily. Forwarded,
as Attachment. No. 2, is a copy of an AP cable, dated 25 October
1965, reporting a statement by the White House Press Chief
and J. Edgar Hoover that the news published in the New York
Herald Tribune stating that the President had authorized the
FBI to gather intelligence abroad is not true. The Mundo
Americano `published a distorted version of the cable (see
Attachment No. 3) and also an editorial praising President
Johnson's action against CIA (see Attachment No. 4).
11. Rolando MASFERRER Rojas writes a column in the
Mundo Americano using the pen name "Policarpo Pineda", in
which he frequently attacks CIA. Copies of MASFERRER'S
column are attached as Attachment No. 5.
Blackmail
12. On 26 October 1965, Mundo Americano published an
article entitled "Opposition to the Dynasty of the Somozas"
(see Attachment No. 6). On 2 November 1965, another article
appeared on the front page of Mundo Americano reporting that
General SOMOZA was gravely 111 In a Baltimore, Maryland,
hospital. According to conversations overheard by source,
after the appearance of these articles, the directors of the
newspaper, including Rolando MASFERRER, were summoned to the
Nicaraguan Embassy in Washington, D.C. At the meeting the
Ambassador from Nicaragus pointed out that the news appearing
in the paper was false. An argument between the Ambassador
and MASFERRER ensued and MASFERRER was thrown out of the meet-
ing. After that, a second meeting took place between the
Nicaraguan Ambassador and the directors of the newspaper and
since the second meeting, the newspaper has not attacked the
SOMOZAS. The directors of Mundo Americano have insinuated
that there has been some financial arrangement.

Inside Struggles
13. When Mundo Americano was first published, Jose LOPEZ
Vilaboy had financial control of the newspaper. Currently,
however, control is in the hands of Rolando MASFERRER Rojas
and Ceferino R. PEREZ Carril. In Cuba, PEREZ Carril campaigned
politically for BATISTA and was a Cuban Army Captain during
the BATISTA Regime.
14. Since the newspaper was first published, it's policy
has been controlled by the group having financial control.
Although MASFERRER's and LOPEZ Vilaboy's groups both follow
the BATISTA line, LOPEZ is in favor of a soft line and MASFERRER
is in favor of a hard line, attacking groups and persons with
which he does not agree. Since MASFERRER and PEREZ have
obtained control of the newspaper, it has constantly attacked
the U.S. Government and the CIA. LOPEZ is not in favor of
attacking the U.S. Government, the CIA or the Spanish Govern-
ment. MASFERRER, however, states that LOPEZ can do nothing
about it because he no longer controls the newspaper financially.
As a result of the recent shift in power, two of LOPEZ' men,
Francisco CASADO Remedios and Jose M. PEREZ, were moved
from their positions in Mundo Americano on 19 September 1965.
15. The following are Station file traces on persons
mentioned in this report:
a. Amado GARCIA Torres: QRPLUTO candidate for
labor training seminar. Dropped because of his youth
and inexperience (UFGA-17332, 26 August 1964).
b. Frank MALDONADO: Probably identical with
Francisco MALDONADO Iglesias. WH CE cards indicate that
MALDONADO arrived in Guatemala from the Dominican Repub-
lic in August 1960 as an agent of TRUJILLO, and contacted
Cuban exiles to try to set up the Movimiento Integracion
Nacional (MIN), an anti-Castro organization. Subject,
who was travelling without documents, was deported from
Guatemala to Miami. DBA-19283 of 14 August 1962 reported
that Subject, born circa 1928, residing Apt. 13-A,
Olimpo Street, Santurce, Puerto Rico, advertising sales-
man, was anti-Castro and an unpaid informant of the
SIM (Military Intelligence Service).
c. Juan Angel BRAS: Subject may be identical with
Juan A. BRAS who appears on WH CE cards as residing
729 7th Ave., New York 19, N.Y., in February 1960 and
working at Falcon Bron. Co., 101 Maiden Lane, New York,
according to information of 10 October 1960. According
to the card, BRAS, a U.S. citizen, is considered by
Joseph MIRANDA as a top level consultant to the FRD
(Democratic Revolutionary Front) and someone worth cul-
tivating by the Agency. He has been active in Cuban
affairs since 1932 and was director of public relations
and radio for the 26 of July Movement in New York, as
well as adviser to Harold Janis, Director of Special
Events Voice of America from 1942 to 1948.
d. Enrique PIZZI de Porras is probably identical
with Henrique PIZZI de Poreas of 1139 Ridgewood Road,
West Palm Beach, who is in correspondence with former
President BATISTA who is now residing in Madeira.
(OPL-719, 13 November 1959.)
