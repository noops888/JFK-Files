ODENVY Reports on Susan Heiligman Frank and Richard Cyril Frank
ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES
1. Forwarded under separate cover for your background information are
pertinent portions of an ODENVY report dated 12 February 1965 (attachment A)
concerning Susan Heiligman Frank (201-191098) and her husband, Richard Cyril
Frank, who have been of investigative interest to ODENVY for several years
because of their Communist activities. In recent years these activities have
been on behalf of Chinese Communism, and in January 1965 an ODEVY repre-
sentative stated to a KULAMP officer that Susan Frank is suspected of being
a Chinese Communist agent. The attached information is forwarded because of
the travel to Milan during 1964 both of Richard Frank (in May 1964, per the
ODENVY report in attachment B) and Susan Frank (in August 1964, per
attachment A).
2... Following is a summary of information concerning the Franks which
is based on ODENVY reports...
Mildred Susan Frank (known as Susan Frank, nee Heiligman),
born in New York on 8 November 1913 of Russian parentage, resides
with her second husband, Richard Cyril Frank, at 110 Christopher
Street, New York City. There are reports as early as 1942
providing information on Susan Frank's activities on behalf of
Communism, all of which refer to her as Susan or Sue Warren, the
alias she has commonly used in her Communist activities and in
the articles she has written. In 1942 she was chairman of the
Communist Party 12th Assembly District at 132 East 26th Street,
NYC. Her occupation is given as writer and lecturer. She has
been described as having been well-trained in Far Eastern affairs
and has taught at the Faculty School of Social Sciences and
Jefferson School of Social Sciences, conducting courses entitled,
"The New China," "The Chinese Communes," "On the Correct Handling
of Contradictions (MAO)," etc. In June, 1959, she was nominated
to the Latin American Sub-Committee of the International Affairs
and Peace Commission, CPUSA.

In November 1959, she and her husband went to Communist
China, where she had been invited to work on the "Peking Review"
(a magazine published for dissemination outside China) for two
years. As of June 1961, the Franks were back in New York, having
returned via the USSR. In July 1962, Susan Frank was reported to
be a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, CPUSA. She conducted
a class entitled "The Real China" during August 1962 at the N. Y.
School for Marxist Studies. She and her husband (who was born on
22 August 1922 in Rochester, New York) have been in contact with
Charles Joseph (Bob) Coe and his wife, Rose Marie Coe, on whom
traces were provided in paragraph 4 of OIRM 22387, 20 March 1964
(copy attached for Milan). These traces note that several ODENVY
reports have stated that the Coe's have sided with China in the
Korea-China dispute.
