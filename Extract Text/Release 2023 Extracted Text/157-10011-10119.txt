1. Reference is made to a memorandum, captioned as above,
dated 30 September 1975 forwarding copies of certain documents
from the Office of Security files concerning Charles W.Wiley.d
These documents were requested by Mr. Jeffrey Kayden, Senate
Select Committee Staff, who commenced a review of the Wiley
files on 29 September 1975.
2. The Office of Security has concluded a separate review
of the Wiley files and has highlighted certain contents thereof
to the DCI. The DCI has requested that materials concerning
the following items be provided to the Senate Select Committee
independent of any Senate Select Committee Staff requests, to
wit:
Lee Harvey Oswald
The files contain a raw, unevaluated report
from Miley containing his reporting of an alle-
gation that Lee Harvey Oswald was in New York
City in the Winter of 1962, having contact with
a Cuban.
(Attached to instant memorandum, Tab A, is
a copy of Miley's original report, and attendant
comments, suggesting receipt of the report circa
20 December 1963.)
Readily available public and Office of
Security information concerning Oswald makes
no reference to the possibility of his being
in New York City in the Winter of 1962.
Warren Commission did not pursue such a line
of inquiry.

There is no evidence in the Wiley files or
the file of the source, Enrique Eugenio Abascal
(y Berenguer), #730643, that this information
was processed out of the Office of Security/
Security Research Staff, to which Wiley reported
the information. However, as Wiley states in
the report: "I urged Abascal to go to the FBI
with the information, and offered to arrange a
meeting. He promised to tell them the story,
and made contact through an agent (O'Brien)
whom he knew because of past activities."
Regarding Abascal, his Office of Security
file contains the following concerning his
veracity:
Office of Security/Security Research
Staff memorandum dated 15 August 1966:
"Abascal has for several years furnished
information to SRS source which has been
proven to be utterly worthless and
usually fictitious."
Office of Security/Security Research
Staff memorandum dated 19 May 1965:
"(Abascal) has furnished source with
intelligence information which appears
to be complete fabrication."
FBI letterhead memorandum dated
30 September 1963 captioned "Movimiento
Democrata Cristiano (MDC)" contains the
following statements about Abascal by
FBI sources: "One would only have to
know Enrique Abascal to know that this
(a Life magazine article) was nothing
but a publicity stunt on his part and
that he has no importance whatsoever in
the anti-Castro Movement." "Sometimes
in dealing with Abascal, one does not
know whether or not he should pity him
or try to afford him some kind of medical
assistance." "Abascal is merely a pub-
licity seeker."

It is apparent the Office of Security/
Security Research Staff had reason to
question the veracity of Abascal precluding
further dissemination of the information;
and that there was a reason to believe
that Abascal would report the information
to the FBI for their action.
Arlington House, Publishers
The files contain a raw, unevaluated
report from Wiley containing his reporting
of an allegation that CIA had partial
control of, and once attempted full control
of, Arlington House, Publishers.
(Attached to instant memorandum, Tab B,
is a copy of Wiley's original report as well
as copies of attendant documents. The files
contain no further clarification of the
information.)
There is no Office of Security subject
file in the name of Arlington House or
Arlington House, Publishers.
From other sources, it would appear
that Arlington House, Publishers is con-
nected with the conservative causes of
William F. Buckley and the National Review.
Buckley is a former Agency employee and
his close connections with former Agency
employee E. Howard Hunt have recently
received extensive publicity. It is
believed that numerous former Agency
employees are linked with Buckley's causes,
and this could be the foundation for the
rumored Agency involvement in Arlington
House.

Re: LEE HARVEY OSWALD. Abascal met Oswald last winter
in Greenwich Village, New York City at the "Fat Black
Pussy Cat" (which was much less expensive than it is
now, with fewer tourists). Abascal saw him there several
times with extreme leftist, peacenik types. He seemed
to be a "loner", but did associate with a couple in
their early thirties. (See below.)
The last time that Abascal saw Oswald he got into a
conversation with him, and it almost ended in a fight.
Abascal, lost his temper and wanted to hit Oswald be-
cause of his strong communist position. He was very
anti-U.S.A., pro-Castro and pro-Chinese Reds (but not
pro-Soviet Union).
What interested Abascal most was that Oswald had no job
but still had sufficient money.
The couple Oswald associated with were quiet, but during
political discussions the man would feed Oswald key words
or bits of information when he was backed into a corner.
(Note. I urged Abascal to go to the FBI with the information,
and offered to arrange a meeting. He promised to tell them
the story, and made contact through an agent (O'Brien) whom
he knew because of past activities.)
Sources from inside Cuba have reported that HERBERT MATTHEWS
and two Russians met with Fidel Castro several months ago
and tried to convince him to step down in favor of a coalition
gov't. that Khrushchev and Kennedy had agreed on. Castro
refused to consider it. (Some Cubans think that Castro is
behind the Kennedy assassination
that he was acting to
block this deal which was to take effect before the 1964
election.)
In early Dec. (see memo on my telephoned report for exact
date) Abascal reported that CARLOS FRANKE of the Castro
publication "Revolution" was at Idlewild Airport. He had
arrived on flight 509 of BOAC from Paris & London. Franke
had just finished a trip behind the Iron Curtain.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:
SUBJECT: WILEY, Charles W
#343 589
12 April 1974
A memorandum dated 12 March 1970 seems to pinpoint
the time period during which WILEY first made available to this
office a copy of Howard HUNT's manuscript, "Give Us This Day, "
as being early March 1970. The memorandum from William
MILLIGAN to C/SRS advised that WILEY had telephoned from
home that afternoon and had asked if we had received the copy-
of "Hunt Ms." MILLALIGAN told WILEY that it had come in and
WHEY asked whether he should attempt to determine any more
details concerning the origin of it. MILLIGAN suggested that
WILEY do nothing until we advised him. (Although MULLIGAN
referred to it as the "Hunt Ms." in his memorandum, it would
seem that WILEY was not aware of the true authorship, at this
point). WILEY expressed concern for his friend in the publish-
ing house, who had "filched" the Ms., as he allegedly had
informed WILEY to be very careful with it. MILLIGAN advised
that he informed WLEY that in all probability no decision would
be made on this for another three or four weeks.

In Jan 1967, WILEY prepared a memorandum concerning Arlington House Publisherz
which, based on hearsay, indicated that a fight was going on for control of the
company. One runor was that CIA wanted to take over control.
Apparently this
memo. was again brought to the attention of C/SRS in April 1970 with the comment by
MILLIGAN "In going through some of WILEY'S old reports, I found this. Possibly
of interest in view of HUNT's manuscript." The buck slip was ope// marked "Hoted 250"

:
In June 1970 when I was assigned to the L303/SRS, there was a copy of HUNT's
manuscript on the Bay of Pigs being retained in a safe in the C/L308's office. Some
time later I learned that WILEY had apparently obtained it through a contact and
had forwarded/to thes office...as an item of probable interest. The Agency was able
to ascertain the identity of the author, who turned out to be Howard HUNT. HUNT
was, I believe, at that time employed by the Agency with DOD. In any case, he was
approached under some guise and was convinced that it would be inappropriate for him
to have the book published at that time. HUNT's file probably contains details
which do not appear in old SRS records re WILEY
I believe some time later, C7SRS
I do not know what disposition he
made of it. It is my impression that this was an extra copy and that the copy
that had been loaned to WILEY and through WILEY to SPS had been returned much
earlier as it was an accountable item for WILLY'S contact. The publisher may have
been Arlington Publishers although this is only a vague recollection tha that C/SRS
took the copy from 1503.

to a different publisher. (WILEY reportedly had made it available at that time).
WILE said that he believed that this publisher was going to take advantage of the
recent publicity (meaning WATEEGATE apparently) and, of course, bring it out under
HUNT's true name. I tole him I was sure that we had no interest in his copy and that
he could return it to the contact who made it available to him. There was no further

For many months there has been a fight going on for control
of Arlington House. Forces led by Randy Richardson are
involved in trying to take over from Neil McCaffrey.
According to Mrs. Herbert (Pat) Homerstein, one of the
factors in the fight is that Clients to take over full
control and that it is necessary for CIA to such ineffrey
out of the picture. Randy Richardson, because of his
association with the Richardson Foundation and Frank
Barnett, is considered by some to be involved with CIA
activity.
Frank Meyer has attempted to rally the arlington House
authors those who have received contracts to write books
behind NeCaffrey. He sent out a letter to all of the authors
suggesting that they take the stand that their contracts
are with McCaffrey personally, not with arlington House as
a company. This has not with much opposition,
primarily because the authors foel that they would become
lieblo to return any money advanced to them by Arlington
House. James Burnham's name was listed in Meyer's letter
as supporting his position. However, later Burnham sent
out his own letter stating that he considered his controet
to be with arlington House, not HeCaffrey.
(Kote: I have many contacts who are involved in this
situation in one way or another. It would not be difficu
to get additional information if necessary.)
