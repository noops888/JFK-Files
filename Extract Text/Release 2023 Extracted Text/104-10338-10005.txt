SUBJECT: RELATIONS WITH CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE
AGENCY (CIA)
Reference is made to memorandum dated 12/19/63, Mr.
Brennan to Mr. Sullivan. Pursuant to instructions, Agent Papich
met with John McCone, Director, CIA, on 12/23/63, to confront the
CIA Director with false statements attributed to him by Mr. DeLoach's
sources. The Liaison Agent is reporting this meeting in some detail
so that you may have full appreciation of all aspects.
Agent Papich advised McCone that he had a piece of business
which needed ironing out before the end of the year. The Agent ex-
plained that since the assassination of President Kennedy, there
have been various types of stories circulated concerning the case
and the evidence collected; that some of these stories could immedi-
ately be discounted; and that there was certain information received
in the Bureau which very directly affected relations between the
Bureau and CIA.. The Agent stated that certain information had reached
such a proportion to be most alarming and that the Agent had requested
permission from Mr. Hoover to discuss the matter with the CIA Director
McCone was then told that he was charged with being the
source of information conveyed to a high Government official and to
Drew Pearson in that he, McCone, had stated that CIA had uncovered
a plot in Mexico City indicating that Lee Harvey Oswald had received
$6,500 to assassinate President Kennedy. The Agent elaborated by
stating that if this were true, McCone had endeavored to leave the
impression with certain people that CIA had developed information not
known to the Bureau and, in essence, made the Bureau look ridiculous.
The Agent advised that if McCone had made such statements, we could
only assume that he was employing vicious and underhanded tactics
since he and officials of his agency fully well knew that the story
concerning the $6,500 had been proved to be absolutely false. McCone's
attention was directed to the Alvarado interrogation, Alvarado's
admission that he had fabricated the information and the subsequent

Re: RELATIONS WITH CIA
corroboration of the polygraph.(5)
McCone was very visibly incensed and left the impression
that he might at any moment ask the Agent to leave. After pausing
a few moments, he made the following statements: 6
(1) He stated that he has never talked to Drew Pearson
in his life; that he has never sent any kind of message to
Pearson directly or indirectly and that he does not have any
intention of communicating with Pearson. He briefly referred
to the fact that he has been the target of attacks by Pearson,
one of these occurring within the last two weeks.ا
(2) With regard to the "$6,500 story," McCone advised
that as soon as the original report was received from his
people in Mexico City, he contacted President Johnson and
informed him of the development. He explained to the Presi-
dent that this was a matter which required intensive interro-
gation of Alvarado and that CIA had coordinated very closely
with the FBI. He told the President that Alvarado would be
kept in a safe house by CIA until the FBI was satisfied that
all necessary investigative action had taken place. (5)
(3) McCone advised that he has not been critical of the
Bureau; that if he had any criticism he would confer directly
with the Bureau and not get involved in malicious gossip. He
commented that in connection with the Oswald case, he has
encountered people who have been critical of the Bureau and
the Secret Service and he, McCone, has gone to the defense
of both agencies.(S)
McCone was left in an angry mood but he did retain his com-
posure throughout. Before the Agent left, McCone inquired about the
status of FBI - CIA relations in general and the Agent replied that
they were satisfactory. He also asked about the Director's health
which the Agent answered that the Director was in excellent health.
As indicated above, no statement was made which in any
way might jeopardize the security of Mr. DeLoach's sources.

Authenticity of Document
1. This is in response to your request to this office
to review the attached document and advise if it is a valid
Agency document or something made up using an Agency reports
format and information either entirely made up or from other
sources. The 3 August 1962 document purports to tie Dorothy
Kilgallen, Marilyn Monroe and former Attorney General,
Robert Kennedy, together with knowledge of an number of
matters, including the plot to kill Castro.
2. Those Agency officers who have reviewed the
document consider it to be fraudulent. While the format
resembles a "reports” form used in the 1960's, the
substantive information and presentation is foreign to
normal presentation or collection efforts. Also, the control
stamps and other administrative items are not typical of CIA
reports written during the 1960's.
3. If you have any further questions in this regard,
please call me directly at (703) 351-2909.

FBI Request For CIA'S Opinion
On Proposed FBI Release Of Agent
Specific Data
1. The FBI has asked for an Agency response on the
following matter.
2. HRG counterparts at the FBI are engaged in serious
discussions with representatives of the Review Board
concerning withholding the identities of FBI confidential
informants. In the course of those negotiations, FBI
officers advise they are increasingly concerned about being
able to withhold the crypts and, possible even the true
names, of three former Soviet agents. Given that view, they
believe it would assist their overall efforts and
negotiating position if they could release additional
information on one or more of the three Soviet-agents.
3. The three former Soviet agents are:
a. "TOPHAT" also encrpyted as BOURBON;" true name
is provided on separate attachment.
b. SHAMROCK true name on attachment.
c. "FEDORA" also encrpyted or known as "IRONCLAD”
"SCOTCH" AND "JADE;" true name on attachment.
4. Attached are seven documents that the FBI is
considering for release. Two of them are CIA documents
found in the FBI JFK file. HRG has been unable to locate
these documents in the CIA JFK collection.
5. Please provide DO views on the FBI proposal.
