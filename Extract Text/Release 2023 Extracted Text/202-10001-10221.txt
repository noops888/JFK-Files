PHASE I (CIA)
ACTIVITY
INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS
1. *
Dispatch one intelligence
agent operation to key area
selected by CIA.
1 15 March 1962
PURPOSE
Collect and report intelligence on anti-
regime attitudes, on potential resist.
ance, and on vulnerabilities and
strengths of Communist security
system.
To collect intelligence.
To collect intelligence.
CONSIDERATIONS
There is a risk that this action will disclose this U.S.
intelligence activity within Cuba. Selected personnel
are being intensively trained. This first team has 2
agents. An area in which resistance has been reported
has been selected. Agent operations must stay alive,
make useful contacts, and report securely to CIA.
Physical risk to personnel is substantial, due to lack
of intelligence. First reports from first team are
expected by the end of March, while reports from the
second and third teams, dispatched in March, are ex-
pected to start in April.
Many of the agents infiltrated into Cuba will be trained
for paramilitary skills as well as intelligence collection,
with the thought that they will be in place inside Cuba
and ready to act whenever paramilitary operations are
decided upon. However, CIA has noted that, once the
agents are inside Cuba, they cannot be controlled
effectively from outside Cuba, although every effort
will be made to attempt such control.
These staff intelligence officers may also be used in the
future for communications or agent handling, if future
developments warrant.
* Items marked by asterisk were approved by Special Group (Augmented), 5 March 1962.
2. 3 third-country intelligence
staff officers in place in
Havana.
3. 2 third-country trained intel-
ligence officers, readied to
travel in Cuba for temporary
periods.
ACTIVITY
1 15 March 1962 (cont)
PURPOSE
CONSIDERATIONS
4. Caribbean Admission Center,
Opa-Locka, Florida, fully
activated by 15 March 1962.
To collect intelligence required for the
operations, to identify and earmark in..
telligence assets as refugees arrive,
and to provide security against Com-
munist agent operations.
This operation, in response to early recommendati on
as essential by the Chief of Operations, is moving at
utmost speed to become fully active by 15 March, with
a new building completed and occupied, and with a
staff of 43 at work. Operations commenced 15 February
and, as of 9 March, 33 people were active at the Center.
(CLA responsibility, with support by Defense, Justice,
State, USIA.)
5. Periodic intelligence esti -
mates, as required by progress
of operations.
To up-date NIE 85-62, so that current
estimates can be considered at national
policy levels.
As the operations develop, there will be both increased
intelligence collection and a need for as current an In-
telligence Estimate as the U.S. can produce meaningfully.
It is likely that a more informal method of producing an
Intelligence Estimate for use at the national level (than
now governing the issuance of NIE's) may have to be
followed. CIA is now publishing daily intelligence sum-
maries on Cuba and is planning a bi-monthly or weekly
report summing up intelligence for this purpose. (CIA
responsibility, with support of others as required.)
SLOTHER OPERATIONS
Concure
6 Continue negotiating for
British help in contaminating
locomotive lubricants.
To cripple Cuba's rail transportation.
16 31 March 1962
To collect intelligence.
British assistance is required to undertake a successful
sabotage of Cuban locomotives, through contaminating
lubricants. It is expected that a minimum of 3 months
is required before locomotives in Cuba start breaking
down, once the contaminant is introduced.
INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS
7. Two teams of agents dis-
patched to Cuba.
One team of 4 and one team of 3 agents. Both teams includ
personnel who have had resistance training and some past
experience.
Items marked by asterisk were approved by Special Group (Augmented), 5 March 1962
ACTIVITY
PURPOSE
Establish 2 additional third-
country resident agents in
Cuba.
To collect intelligence.
CONSIDERATIONS
Possible future use in communications and support.
By 31 March, have 105 agents
selected and 50 agents trained.
10.*
Develop intelligence potential
of Cuban "colonies" in U. S.
11.* Develop additional interroga-
tion centers in other areas by
31 March 1962.
To ready agent operations.
To exploit the intelligence possi-
bilities of former residents of
Cuba (including U.S. citizens) now
in the United States.
To collect intelligence in a Latin
atmosphere, at different levels thai.
now seem possible in the continental
U.S., to spot additional intelligence
assets and to provide security
against Communist agent operations.
Effectiveness and numbers are dependent upon purpose
of recruitment, nature of training, and policy decisions
controlling these factors. If the recruitment and train-
ing are for resistance activities, the task of recruit-
ment and training will be much less difficult than if
they are limited to intelligence-collection purpoовев
only.
There are "colonies" in Washington, D. C., and other
U.S. cities which are "little Cubas." Family, Church,
and business interests provoke unusual. personal ties
inside Cuba for some of these residents; a real potential
exists for collection of intelligence not otherwise avail-
able. (FBI support and coordination is basic in this
effort.)
As Opa-Locka becomes fully activated, CIA will acti-
vate other interrogation centers as promptly as feasible.
A center is being activated in Spain. Negotiations w
local authorities are being undertaken to activate centers,
if possible, in Mexico City, Caracas, Aruba. San
Juan, Puerto Rico, and Santiago, Chile are being sur-
veyed for possible centers. (CIA responsibility with sup-
port by others as necessary.)

Difficult
CIA will be attempting to cover as much of Cuba
as it can. The main factor of determining location
of resident agents is to find a place where a trained
agent can stay viable.
24. By 31 May, selection of 50
additional agents and train
35 additional agents.

25. By 31 May, develop a plan for
counterfeiting currency, which
would not be implemented until
a decision was made to debase
the economy in Cuba.
vidy 1702 (cont)
PURPOSE
CONSIDERATIONS
To debase the economy of Cuba.
A counterfeiting program is being developed. Needs
are to staff the proposal thoroughly to permit a policy
decision to be made and to staff out a feasible distribu--
tion plan. It is expected that no decision to implement
such a plan would be made immediately.

26. 10 to 15 teams of agents dis-
patched to Cuba.
27. Reinforce and resupply agents
and teams previously placed or
activated inside Cuba.

To reinforce and resupply, as
possible.
28. By 31 July, select 100 additional To ready agent operations.
29
agents and train 70 additional

* Collection of psychological
material.
30. Survey airfields, military
installations, and communica -
tion centers.
31.*
By the end of July, have
operations to penetrate the
regime.
To provide documentary and photo -
graphic evidence of the tyranny of
the Communist regime.
To provide current intelligence on
key security resources of the
regime.
To provide current intelligence on the
actions and intentions of the regime.
Number of agents in each team and selection of areas
will be determined by developments of the previous
actions and by conditions.
Numbers, areas, and supplies are completely dependent
upon conditions at the time, and upon policy approval of
methods to be used (that is, if air delivery can be used,
or if this activity must depend upon maritime delivery).
This evidence will be used by CIA and USIA to neutralize
the influence of Castro and the Communists in the West-
ern Hemisphere.
This is conceived of as ground surveys, and the possible
recruitment of military and other official personnel as
intelligence agents.
This requires attempts to place trained agents inside
government organizations, or to defect officials "in place. "

PURPOSE
CONSIDERATIONS
32.* Comprehensive and
definitive intelligence
report on attitudes and
abilities of the popula-
tion inside Cuba.
End of July 1962
To provide the Special Group (NCC 5412
augmented) with a hard estimate of the
Cuban situation.
The intelligence estimate will provide a vital basis for
a Special Group recommendation on whether or not the
U.S. should undertake actions to make maximum use
of Cuban resources as a justification for decisive U. S.
military intervention.

ACTIVITY
Make political decision to
intervene with U.S. mili-
tary forces in Cuba.
2..U. S. officials and news
3.
releases on policy decision.
Latin American leaders,
government and public, in
support.
PURPOSE
To overtly engage the U.S. prestige in sup..
port of a Cuban revolt to an extent that would
require the U. S. to become involved in assur-
ing the ultimate victory of a Cuban revolution;
this involvement must include the commitment
of U. S. military forces as necessary to achieve
such victory.
Indicate policy and commit prestige of U. S.
government to appropriate support of the
Cuban people vs. Communist dictatorship.
Commit national prestige and power of Latin
political, intellectual, labor, youth, religious,
military leaders to cause of Cuban people
against Communist regime. For local public
impact, international support, and morale of
resistance within Cuba.
CONSIDERATIONS
This political decision will require considera -
tion of the legal and moral factors, assessed
in the perspective of world opinion and U. S.
security interests.
Top officials of Executive and Legislative
branches to make timely statements. This
should encourage similar attitude by leaders
of other nations and help spirit of Cubans.
Development of sympathy leading to favorable
opinion about outside support for Cuban people
is a goal.
Timely and strong public statements will be
encouraged Maximum publicity at country of
origin, other countries and into Cuba by
CIA assets. Support of State action by CIA and
USIA is involve
OPERATION MONGOOSE
PHASE II (Defense)
1.
ACTIVITY
After political decision,
provide maximum U. S.
support to resistance fight-
ers in Cuba who have been
spotted in Phase I.
2. After political decision,
commit U. S. military forces
in accordance with contingency
plans.
PURPOSE
To assure that Cuban "freedom-fighters"
are fully equipped to attack the Commun-
ist regime's military and police forces;
as part of the assurance, the U. S. support
must include the immediate commitment
of U. S. leadership personnel in combat
operations.
To intervene as required to achieve victory
for the revolutionary forces.
CONSIDERATIONS
DOD support planning, stock piling, readying of
equipment and personnel for commitment must
be developed with maximum lead time. Close
coordination with CIA is required to insure maxi-
mum readiness to meet the immediate needs of
the revolutionary forces. The hazard of visibility
in preparing for these support activities makes
security a paramount consideration.
Consistent with security aspect, U.S. militar-
forces are placed in a state of readiness to
accomplish the assigned mission. The military
forces must be prepared to assist in the mainte-
nance of order until the revolutionary government
is in control.

OPERATION MONGOOSE
PHASE II (CIA)
ACTIVITY
Support U. S. military
actions in Cuba.
PURPOSE
To provide intelligence, guerrilla action, and
Cuban political-psychological support of U. S.
military operations.
CONSIDERATIONS
CLA capabilities must be continuously assessed
and considered in the development of military
planning. Executive responsibility for direct-
ing the use of covert assets must be clearly
understood as resting in the U.S. military
commander of the U. S. intervention, as in
agreed-upon wartime operations.

on Cuban revolt and inter-
vention from the outside
to help the Cuban move-
ment.
PURPOSE
To neutralize opposition to U. S. policy and,
if possible, gain support for U. S. policy in
the Western Hemisphere.
CONSIDERATIONS
Optimum exploitation of news material avail-
able to CIA and Defense is essential.
TOP SECRET SENSITIVE
MON MONGOOSE
PHASE 1 (State)
March
July 1962
ACTIVITY
Political and economic
operations to isolate Castro
regime and neutralize its
influence in the Western
Hemisphere.
PURPOSE
Activities in consonance with U. S. policy
established after the April 1961 failure in Cuba.
CONSIDERATIONS
These activities will have some negative impact
on the Cuban people, who are part of the target, but
are consistent with an overt policy of isolating Castro
and neutralizing his influence in the Western Hemis-
phere. They are noted here, for the sake of com-
pleteness, as actions now being carried out by the
Department of State under other existing programs
and projects.
OPERATION MONGOOSE
PHASE I (Defense)
ACTIVITY
1. Expand special intelligence and
other sensitive intelligence cover-
age of Cuba as required.
2. Develop the means of the Inter-
American Defense Board to pro-
vide substantive intelligence on
Cuban activities.
3. Provide logistic and personnel
support for CIA intelligence
operations into Cuba.
4. The Joint Chiefs of Staff will con-
tinue the planning and essential
preliminary actions to assure a
decisive U. S. military capability
for intervention.
March
July 1962
PURPOSE
To develop increased "hard" intelligence.
To add to the U.S. intelligence coverage
on Cuba and possibly to strengthen the
concern of Latin American states for
security.
To ensure optimum implementation of the
intelligence plan.
To overthrow the Communist government
of Cuba.
CONSIDERATIONS
Use of cays near Cuba entail unacceptable security
risks when vulnerable to Cuban landing parties.
(Defense, in collaboration with CIA.)
Sensitivity of using this multi-national organiza-
tion clearly restricts potential use by USA. Visi-
bility of operational interest is an acceptable risk
here.
The intelligence plan requires support by U.S.
military manpower and equipment.
The U.S. military intervention must be conducted
as quickly as possible and with sufficient force
so that the Communist Bloc's ability to take
effective counter measures is reduced to a
minimum.

PURPOSE
Activities in consonance with U. S.
policy established after the April

CONSIDERATIONS
These activities will have some general impact
upon Castro support and influence in the Western
Hemisphere. There will be some new material
for use as the Phase I intelligence operations
produce but essentially the program is a continua-
tion of that already in effect.
