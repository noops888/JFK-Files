1. The following may be of interest to SAS (Sherwood).
2. On or about 6 Mar 64. Manuel Gonzalez and Jose M. Estevez-
(known generaïly in Los Angeles as supporters of JURE) told repre-
sentatives of the (private) California Intelligence Bureau, Los
Angeles, that they planned to invade Cuba by 20 May 64.
3. Gonzalez and Estevez made no secret of their JURE affiliation
and solicited a donation of $92.00 to equip one fighter.
4. Gonzalez, in February 1964, had previously solicited $92.00
from Phil Rivero "to buy an M-14" for a fighter. Rivero reportedly
told Gonzalez that if Castro's departure meant control of Cuba by
JURE and RAY, he wasn't so sure he wanted Castro to go.

SUBJECT: Rivero Interview of Manuel (Manolo) RAY (00/C Case 42315)
Interviewed on 24 Feb 64, Filiberto Rivere described the circumstances
of the recorded statement as follows:
1. "in connection with ey Spanish language radio
program, as well as in furtherance of my personal interests
in Cuban affairs, I contrived to interview Manuel (Manolo)
RAY on the occasion of his visit and speech at Los Angeles
on Dec 63. RAY is the leader of the supposedly anti-Castro
group known as JURE, or Junta Revolucionaria Cubana. The
interview, with RAY's permission, was taped while we were
proceeding via Volkswagen to the airport. RAY's chauffeur,
significantly, was a JURE supporter, Manolo GONZALEZ who,
I recall, was emotionally condemning the US in front of the
Los Angeles Civic Center at the time of the abortive Bay of
Pigs invasion attempt.
1
2. "As you will note in the taped record, I was
brutally frank with RAY. It was my intention to try to
convince him that his stand did not differ markedly from
that of the Communists. Neither RAY, nor JURd, are prone
to attack Castro frontally. Their response to everything
is a criticism or an attack on Buticta, RAY's devotion
to socialism is pitifully obvious, and reminds me once
more that he did not break with Castro. It was Castro
who threw him out, after the former made it clear in
February 1959 that his object was the Communization of
Cuba. If Castro had not murdered Camillo Cienfuegos and
Huberto Natos, chances are RAY would still be with him.
3. "As you will note, RAY espouses public ownership
of electric power facilities, transportation, communications,
etc. His defense is based exclusively on the allegation,
probably true, that the extension of electric power into
rural areas is not economically feasible, hence neglected
by private industry. No other reason is advanced for the
nationalization of other industries. At any rate, RAY
speaks for himself in the interview, and in the unhappy,
but unlikely event that RAY and JURE ever come to prominence
in Cuba, with or without US government aid, the record will
have more immediate and more devastating significance. As
a matter of fact, one would do well to translate, transcribe
and study it."

1. I heard Manolo Ray's speech to the Cuban exiles in Los Angeles,
and also had an opportunity to visit with him for a few minutes. The
following is my evaluation of Ray.
2. Ray tries to make clear that the Cuban problem is a Cuban
problem, should be handled by Cubans, and should not be considered as
an international situation. He says that the Cubans in the US cannot
cit and wait for things to change. At the same time, he decries any
kind of discrimination in employment of Cuban exiles in the US, claiming
that their skills and their hopes will deteriorate. I suspect that he
feels that they will not be able to contribute financially if they are.
not employed, also. He makes a big point, too, that they must rely
heavily on the people within Cuba, adding that there are many there who
must cooperate now in order to get work and food, but that in their
hearts they are not pro-Fidel. He wants them particularly to get the
message that he is not against them but needs their help.
3. Ray seems to faver a governmental system like Puerto Rico's.
He likes what he described as a "cooperative system," and praises the
idea of government autonomous corporations. At the same time, he says
he is in favor of caintaining private property and supporting education.
His aim, he says, is first to get Cuba out of the Soviet area, and then
into the democratic area, but adds that it would not be proper to trade
a leftist dictatorship for a rightist.
4. Of some 400 or 500 people who heard Ray speak, most were some-
what indifferent, even critical at first, but at the end seemed to
approve.
