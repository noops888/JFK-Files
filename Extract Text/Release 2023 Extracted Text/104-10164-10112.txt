Clémard Joseph CHARLES
President and General Manager
of the Commercial Bank of Haiti
CENTRAL REFERENCE
SERVICE
Clémard Joseph Charles, a man who has
insisted on numerous occasions that he will
be the next President of Haiti, has been
chronically involved, directly or indirect-
ly, in rumored plots against President
Duvalier which have never materialized.
In May 1963 Charles is reported to have
passed word to US officials through an
American journalist that he was in a
position to head a provisional govern-
ment after President Duvalier had been
removed from power. In subsequent years, particularly in 1966.
and 1967, Charles approached US officials both in New York
and Port-au-Prince with the apparent intention of enlisting
US support for a group of conspirators he claimed to lead.
which was determined to topple Duvalier from power. None
of these plots materialized, however, and there was never
any evidence to suggest that any serious plans had been made.
In January 1969 Charles had a lengthy conversation with
an official of the US Embassy in which the former candidl
discussed his grievances against Duvalier and the plot he
claimed to be instigating to overthrow Duvalier and replace
him as President of Haiti. Charles stated that the group
supporting his efforts consisted primarily of soldiers, a
few militiamen, some professional men, priests, students,
and assorted other well-placed individuals. He claimed
that representatives of these groups had already agreed on
the essential elements of a constitution which would in-
clude a bicameral legislature and an operative political
party structure. The reporting official cautioned, how-
ever, that Charles' remarks should be viewed in light of
his previous history of relating such conspiracies..
When President Duvalier was reported to be seriously
ill in mid-May 1969, Charles' neme was again mentioned in
connection with myriad rumors of imminent government take-
ware. According to a reliable source, a military junta
was formed to take power in the event of the death of
Duvalier. The junta purportedly included Gen. Gérard
Constant, Col. Octave Cayard, Col. Kusner Blain, Col.
Roger St. Albin, and Col. René Prosper. Charles was said

to be aware of the identitics of these men. Furthermore,
according to an official of the US Embassy, at one time
it appeared that Charles had originated the idea of the
junta, hoping to utilize it eventually to launch his own
candidacy for the Presidency. Subsequently, however,
Charles changed his statements about being "the next
President" to being "a future President," and he seemed
to be placing some distance between himself and the pro-
posed junta.
During Charles' aforementioned conversation with an
Embassy official in January 1969, he revealed other facets
of his personality as well as his penchant for plotting.
He conceives of his role in Haiti in grandiose, almost
messianic terms. He said that he had invested $2 million
in Haiti and had done more for the development of the
country than any other indigenous Haitian. He claimed,
for example, that the workers in the Artibonite were
passionate admirers of his because his tannery in Port
Sondé (now closed) provided needed jobs. He also claimed
the special allegiance of the chauffeur guides, the only
truly organized workers in the country, because when he
directed the compulsory Government Motor Vehicle Insurance
program, legitimate chauffeur claims were paid. He in-
plied that such claims were no longer honored...
Discussing the internal problems of his country,
Charles stressed the need for immediate steps to prevent
the total destruction of Haiti's land and resources, to
control the spiraling population growth, and to rejuvenate
the country's secondary cities. To achieve these goals
before current trends become irreversible, Charles believes
that it is essential to pursue relations with the United
States that would be conducive to massive assistance: and.
investment. In this respect he insists that Duvalier
has been grossly unrealistic and has done Haiti great
damage by his refusal. to recognize the role the United
States must play in Haitian affairs.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION
(This report was developed and prepared by a US Army representative
assigned to the office of preparation.)
1. I recently spent approximately three days in Haiti (9-12 Dec 68) and
while there had extended visits with Clemard Joseph Charles, President,
Banque Commerciale d'Haiti, and also owner of a sisal plantation and will.
Present during my visits with Charles was his personal assistant and con-
fidant, Ludovich Celestines. Charles, a devout Catholic, personally told
me that he intended to attempt to overthrow Duvalier. He has made specific
plans for this overthrow in late February or early March 1969. He claims
that he definitely has the Army and the Catholic Church with him, and
that the overthrow will be without bloodshed.
2. I had not intended to contact other officials or individuals in Haiti.
However, on the last day of my stay I was invited to visit with Clovis
M. Desinor, formerly Haiti's representative to the UN and currently Dr.
Duvalier's Minister of Finance. He is said to be the No. 2 man in Haiti -
next to Duvalier. Present at the meeting with Desinor was his assistant,
Dr. Herve Boyer and reportedly the No. 3 man.
BACKGROUND
3. I first met the individuals mentioned above in 1965-66 while on an
extended stay in Haiti for business purposes. I was introduced to Charles
by Maxtrowe, a driver assigned to me by the Haitian Government and whose
wife, Raymonde, was the personal secretary for Charles. Rowe continued
to drive for me on that first and subsequent visits to Haiti except o
this latest visit when he was absent in the US.
Carles
4. When I first met Charlos he was President of the Banque Commerciale
d'Haiti, owned the Sisal plantation and mill, also owned a tannery
financed by West German interests, and was the President of the limiti st
Chamber of Commerce and Haitian correspondent for the First National
City Bank of New York. During the period approximately one year prior
to June 1967, Charles put into effect a system of Social Security (Office
of National Assurance) which was working well and liked by the Haitian

people. He also devised an automobile insurance system and was financing
this through the Banque Commerciale d'Haiti.
5. In a period just prior to June 1967 Duvalier was convinced by Desinor and
Boyer that Charles was, or at least had been, plotting Duvaliers' over-
throw. Together with a large group Charles was imprisoned in Port-au-Frinde
from June 1967 to June 1968.
6. Just prior to the arrest of Charles, Max Rowe's wife, Raymonde, took
US$200,000 out of the bank and hid it near Cap Haitien in the north and
advised Charles' wife of the location. In addition, Max Roweclaims
I that in June 1967 he and his wife (Raymonde Rowe is in process of getting
US citizenship. Max is in the US on a visitor's permit) brought papers
incriminating Charles to the US and destroyed them.
BANK'S FINANCIAL CONDITION
:
7. Although Charles has the bank, his position at present is difficult. I
saw the bank balance sheet which shows assets of US$2.9 million but only
US$29,000 (as of 10 Dec 68) cash on hand. With this small amount of cach
he can no longer make loans. He says that he has found it necessary to
make sizeable loans to Haitians who have in turn made highly speculative
loans to others at exorbitant rates of interest. Very minor amounts of
these loans have been repaid to the bank and thus his current finsocial
position.
8. Charles is hopeful that when Duvalier's overthrow has been completed he
will be able to get private financial assistance from the US. According
to Charles, US financial organizations have almost completely stopped
their assistance because of the oppressive Duvalier Government.
9. Charles says that Max Rowe is awere of his plans to overthrow Duvalier:
which were communicated to Rowe by a La Bonte Jean, who is also in the
US. Charles says that the Army is unhappy with Duvalier because of the
execution of fourteen officers after the abortive May 1968 invasion,
which included Najor Toma, who was popular and powerful in his position as
a censor and in control of all foreigners coming into Haiti. Charles
maintains that the Ton Ton Macoutes are no longer a potent force - not
operational. They have no food and are receiving no pay.
10. John Perre La Grand, UK Consul General in Haiti and Shell Oil General
Manager, agrees with Charles that Desinor and Boyer are Duvalier's closest
confidants. Fito Metales (alias Fritz Belmont) is said by Rowe and
La Grand to be Duvalier's hatchet man. Ee is manager of the Croupiera
at the Royal Cabaret. La Grand says that the "old man", (Duvalier) is
stronger than ever, both in health and power.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION
1. Effective 10 Jul 68, Clemard Joseph Charles was reinstated..
as the president of the Commercial Bank of Baiti (BCH), as
announced in the Haitian public press. A stockholders' mset-
ing is scheduled for mid-Ang 68.
2. I have heard from previously reliable sources that Charles vas
compelled to pay to the Government of Haiti (GOH) the sum of
UB$200 thousand (not Haitian gourds) as the price of reinstate-
nent as head of the BCH. Charles has also promised, as part
of the price of retustatement, to pay an additional. US$400
thousand. This total of US$600 thousand closely approximatas
the US$605 thousand cited earlier as the "ranson" for Charles'
release from prison. I understand that the US$200 thousand
has already been paid. "Whare Charles got this sum. I do not
know. He could have withdram the US$100 thousand which be
has on deposit at the First National City Bank in New York
City) I do not know whether or not he has done so. It seems
clear that President Duvalier has decided that the possible
long-term benefits of allowing the bank to function (and thus
enabling Charles to raise the required US$400 thousand and also
possibly attracting foreign investment capital to Haiti) out-
weigh the benefits of refusing him permission to operate until
the total "ranson" should have been paid.

2. In Jano 1967, Charles was arrested in Port-au-Prince
and has spent the majority of the time since then in jail. He is
released at various intervals by Duvalior apparently to give him
the opportunity to locate more money for the regime. Since
Charles foll from grace, it has become apparent that any hopes

past. Accordingly, we wish to advise that WH/7 has no special

Si tu n'as pas eu de mes nouvelles depuis mon départ d'Haiti le 7 mai dernier,
c'est que premièrement, je me prorosais de retourner voir Clémart la semaine

lui annoncer mon arrivée et je suis sûr qu'il a dû t'en informer.
Dueièrement, l'arrestation de Clémard ainsi que les nouvelles der derniers
événements en Haiti on eu des effets négatifs sur les négociations en cours
que j'avais entamées pour Clémard et qui semblaient vouloir boutir. Je n'ai
pas besoin de te dire combien j'en ai été bouleversé. Alors que nos amis
d'ici et moi pensions pouvoir aider Clémard que nous estimons comme un frère,
sa nouvelle arrestation est venue nous assommer avec une rigueur dont nous
nous remettons à peine.
Avant d'aller plus loin, je dois te dire que tu ne dois point touter de notre
dévouement pour Clémard. Il sait, et tu dois aussi le savoir, que nous ne
saurions jamais marchander notre concours à un ami pour qui nous avons la plus
grande affection et pour qui nous sommes prêts à consentir tous les cacrifices
personnels que les circonstances peuvent exiger. Je crois devoir te dire que
si, en dehors d'Haiti, je n'arrive à le tirer de l'impasse dans laquelle il se
trouve, je doute fort, sans fausse modestie, que quelqu'un d'autre puisse
réussir à le faire.
Nos puissants amis communs tant à New York, Washington, Miami et ailleurs ont
tous manifesté un désir sérieux de lui venir en aide dans les limites de leurs
possibilités respectives.
Dopuis mon retour d'Haiti je me suis mis en action à cette fin et ai personelle-
mont vu plusieurs personnalités du monde financier qui n'ont pas hésité à
consacrer une grande partie de leur temps précieux à la concrétisation des plans
que j'ai eu à envisager avec Clémard en vue de lo tirer d'embarras le plus
rapidement possible...

Xes espoirs de réussite ainsi que ceux de tous les amis contactés se sont
heurtés aux effets négatifs inévitables provenant tant de la nouvelle arres-
tation de Clémard que des derniers événements survenus en Haiti depuis le
20 mai écoulé. Je t'envoie, pour preuve, copie d'une lettre d'un de ces
grands azis, Mr. Howard Barris de Washington, D.C. Je te demande de garder
cette lettre strictement confidentielle car je n'aurais pas aimé que le nom
de Mr. Barris soit mentionné à quiconque en Haiti. Si cela arrivait, nous
pourrions perdre un très bon ani.
Pour ton information, je te dirai que Mr. Durris est un colonel retraité du
Corps de Génie de l'armée américaine, ani personnel et conseiller du Président
Johnson et extrêmement influent à Washington tant dans le monde politique que
financier. J'ai eu à faire deux voyages à Washington entre le 8 et 11 mai au
coura desquels lui et moi envisagions les moyens d'aider Clémard selon le "modus"
envisagt. La copie de sa lettre du 7 juin en cours saura te confirmer ce qui
préodde.
J'ai aussi vu personnellement et lui ai causé maintes fois au téléphone,
Joseph Dryer, qui devait se rendre en Haiti le 24 mai pour te vois mais qui a
dû renvoyer son voyage, après les nouvelles de la dernière tentative d'invasion.
Je lui al encore causé récemment au téléphone et il a cu à me faire part des
résultats négatifs de ses efforts, toujours en fonction des mêmes
