1. Due to operational requirements a meeting was not
held with Edward C. TICHBORN by an Adain representative, how
ever, the items noted below were briefly discussed with him
by telephone on 26 October.
2. TICHBORN was advised information would be forwarded
to the Station and, upon his return to the Station, he should
ask his contact about the items--both as a reminder and for
fuller explanation. As will be noted, there is a time element
concerned with c. below.
a. Reference A (Transmittal of hospitalization claim).
TICHBORN asked about the claim and was advised the dia-
patch was received 5 October and the separate cover was
received by the insurance Branch on 25 October. The ine
surance section has agreed to expedite the claim and it
is expected Pinence will advise the Station of the amount
of reimbursement to TICHBOR!! within the next two-threo
weeks.
b. Reference B (Concerned signing the contract anend-
sent forwarded by Book Dispatch 5178). The provisions of
the BD regarding signing the amendment still pertain. The
subject was very briefly but, by no meatis thoroughly, ex-
plained. In this connection, it had been planned to have
him read the two attached pamphlets "Your Social Security"
and Social Security Amendments--1965". If cover or oper
ational considerations do not preclude, the pamphlets may
de given to TICHSORN to either read and return to the
Station or to retain.
