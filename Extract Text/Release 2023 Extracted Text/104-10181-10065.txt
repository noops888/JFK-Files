1. Paragraph one of reference C should be modified to show that
SLOBODA knew John T. Ossenbrink by trwname as early as March 1960,
at which time Ossenbrink dealt with SLOBODA officially in the procuring
of East German city pians and other materiale for CATHINK. Since
occupying the CATHINK offices in late Kay of 1960, Ossendrink sav
SLOBODA about three times in the latter's office, each of which visita
concerned the acquisition of basic Intelligence materials (9.g., East
Geraan telephone books, city plans, etc.). Ossendrink did not indicate
to SLOBODA the reason for Ossendrink's request for these materiale, but
SLOBODA did know Ossendrink's phone extension at Casy King, since
Ossenbrink occasionally left word with SLOBODA for SLOBODA's superior,
Mr. Len Heller, Chief of Publications Procurement Section, to phone
Ossenbrink for official purposes.

2. Ossendrink has questioned all KUBARK (CACHINX staff members on
their knowledge of SLOBODA, making use of a photograph of SLOBODA for
this purpове. Hone had any personal contact with him; however, all
folt that they had seen his at the Caap King coffee bar. It should
be noted that many US Army military personnel et Camp King hayg
official knowledge of the official and unofficial name of CATHTEX (...
attachment under separate cover), and that the KUBARK CAPHINK staff
members are employees of DAD/Germany] Kobigned to Cauf king for work in
02 CATHINK. The aane and mission of CATRINK is classified presently
CONFIDENTIAL - NOPORE, which means that the official name and mission
of [CATHINK is widely known among other US Army offices at Caap King,
which also had frequent occasion to deal with SLOBODA's former office.
Moreover, in convereing with US Army personnel at the Camp King coffee
bar, it is conceivable that SLOBODA learned the true nanes of all
KUBARK CATHINK personnel without their knowledge.

3. In summary, it appears that SLOBODA could have learned the
02 ..

following about CAPINK during the period Marsh-August 1960 -
Official and unofficial name and mission of
CAPHINX. (Official and unofficial name of CATHINK
