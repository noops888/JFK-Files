ABSTRACT
MICROFILM
1. Following are the results of the debriefing of AMFAUNA-14 in
the JMWAVE area from 22 November to 2 December 1963.
2. AMFAUNA-14 did not leave her apartment all day Sunday, 6 Oct.
On Monday, 7 October, she went to work as usual. When she arrived, she
found a letter waiting for her which had been forwarded to her office
from her accommodation address; it was in AMPAUNA-1's handwriting and
contained nothing of any interest, so she was sure there was a secret
writing message on it.
3. At 1255 hours two men arrived at the office, one about 45 years
old and short, who from his appearance might have been a bus driver,
and the other a very young dark-skinned man. They walked into the
office vestibule and told the guard that they wanted to see AMFAUNA-14.
The guard came into the office to give AMFAUNA-14 the message, and the
two men followed right behind. They told AMFAUNA-14 that she had to
come with them to identify an arrested person. AMFAUNA-14 said that
she would have to ask her supervisor for permission to leave, because
it was not yet closing time. She turned to go back into the office,
and the two men followed her in. The supervisor told her that it
would be all right for her to go, but said that she should check in by
phone if there were any difficulty. AMFAUNA-14's father and uncle,
both of whom work in the same office, asked whether they could come
with her. The men said no, because she would be coming right back;
they said they were taking her to "G-2" headquarters in La Vibora.

AMFAUNA-14 tried to dispose of the letter she had just re-
ceived from AMFAUNA-1 by leaving it on the desk of a fellow employee
together with some potatoes and a carrot for cover, but the men would
not let her. She did, however, manage to destroy a page from her note-
book containing telephone numbers.
5. At the DSE headquarters in Villa Maristas, AMFAUNA-14 was
turned over to a militiawoman who had her strip and performed a body
search on her. She was fingerprinted and photographed and her biographic
data were taken down, after which she was locked in a cell which had
an adjoining private bath. Nothing else of importance happened for
the rest of the day.
6. During her four-day detention period, AMFAUNA-14 was handled
by the following DSE officers:
C.11. LBH NCB 11915 ELISAGENT
SUD INTERACEATE
SHAVANA, CUBA
ァスタのノーマル) Francisco ABAD: AMFAUNA-14 believes that this is his
real name. He did not introduce himself, but she saw the name on her
release papers which he signed. He was born about 1918 and is about
5'4" tall, weighs about 160 pounds, and has a fat build, aquiline nose,
greenish eyes, dark skin, grey-brown wavy hair, rough laborer's hands,
and two teeth missing from the lower jaw. He smokes both cigars and
cigarettes, his manner was soft and kindly, and AMFAUNA-14 believes
he is probably poorly educated. He is married, but AMFAUNA-14 did not
learn whether he has children or what his address is. He wears civilias
Clothes

and drives a black 1956 Pontiac with a grey roof. Discussing
this man later in the AMCOG household, AMFAUNA-14 was told by Pedro
CARRILLO (who is a brother of Justo CARRILLO) that Pedro knows ABAD.
According to Pedro, ABAD is part Jewish and an old Communist who worked
in the Havana Underground on behalf of Fidel CASTRO during the Batista
period. Pedro CARRILLO thinks that ABAD may now have some regrets
about the course he has taken.
(b) "Carlos" aka "Samuel": AMFAUNA-14 does not know his true
name. He was born about 1942 or perhaps a little earlier. He is
about 5'6" tall, weighs about 150 pounds, and has a muscular build,
drooping eyelids, light olive skin, wavy chestnut hair with a widows
peak. He is a nervous pacer, and walks with his head bent forward and
tilted slightly to one side. An expression which he frequently used
was "O.K." pronounced "OKAH" with the accent on the first syllable.
He told AMFAUNA-14 that he had been a student in the Commercial School
of Havana, that he had worked clandestinely under the Batista regime,
had been arrested by Col. Esteban VENTURA Novo, had been released due
to the influence of his father, and had gotten out of the country with
the aid of the Mexican Ambassador to Cuba, coming then to the United
States. He drives a 1959 black and white Chevrolet Corvair, wears
civilian clothes, and carries a pistol, sometimes a .45 and sometimes
a.38. AMFAUNA-14 believes him to be a 100% Communist. She thinks he
may have been somewhat better trained than Francisco ABAD and may have
boon somewhat superior in rank, although this was never clearly evident
There seemed to be a little professional jealousy between the two men.
If she told one man something which she had been unable to remember
for the other, the second would show signs of jealousy or resentment.
"Carlos" subsequently told AMFAUNA-14 to phone 61-4319 and ask for
"Samuel" when she wanted to reach him. She phoned him at this number
about ten times in all. The phone was always answered by the same
waan, except for once when a boy answered and then called for his
ncther to come and take the phone. AMFAUNA-14 would ask for "Samuel"
and the woman would invariably reply that he was not there. AMFAUNA-
14 would then ask the woman to take a message for him to please call
"Dolores." The woman would always reply "Yes, Comrade." Discussing
this person later within the AMCOG household, AMFAUNA-14 was told by
Israel PADILLA that he thought "Carlos" was Samuel RODILES.

name include HCSA-09896 of 23 April 1963 showing that one Maria CARCANO
Arujo (born 7 December 1935) travelled to Chile in March and April 1963
on a diplomatic passport. An AMOT report of 27 September 1962 mentions
one Antonia CARCANO Araujo as a communist in charge of vigilance, and
living at 47 Artes St., Casablanca. There also appears to be a Maria
ARAUJO (born about 1902) who is an old-time Communist living at Artes
47. AMPAUNA-1 has been given the names of several former residents of
this neighborhood in hopes of finding a relative of the CARCANO or
ARAUJO families whose physical description matches that of "Carlos,"
AMPAUNA-1 has also interviewed Col. VENTURA in the WAVE area. VENTURA
remsabers case similar to that of "Carlos" but does not remember the
boy's name. He says that he seems to remoaber that the boy's father
was connected with one Jose LOPEZ Villaboy (on whom WAVE has numerous
traces) and that he was assisted in getting to Mexico by a Mexican
diplomat named "Benjamin." CIT: CUBA BCLFS AGENT DOD. 1939

(c) Fnu Inu: This man appeared a few times during AMFAUNA-
14's interrogation. The never heard his name at this time, but later
saw him on television interrogating AMBIG-2 and he was identified
then as Jose Antonio FERNANDEZ Menert. She does not believe that this
is his true name, because it is her understanding that DSE officers use
aliases in their public appearances. He is about 5'11" tall, slender,
with darkish skin and black hair combed straight back. He has very
large green cold eyes. He was born about 1939 and appears to be un-
educated, with a cynical and vulgar manner. He wears civilian clothes

7. At about 1600 or 1700 hours on Tuesday, 8 October, AMFAUNA-14
was brought into ABAD's office for her first interview. ABAD began
by asking if she knew why she was there. AMFAUNA-14 replied that she
had no idea. ABAD observed that that was strange, because he had
judged her to bo an able and intelligent woman.

said that this was strange, because VILLAR Negret knew her. He asked
if she knew one Angel BRINGAS. AMFAUNA-14 said that she did. ABAD
asked why, if she knew BRINGAS, she would deny knowing his cousin NEGRET.

ANTAUHA-14's connection with NEGRET had been.
NEGRET had been in her house once, and once in her mother's.
18. At this point in the interrogation, ABAD was called away and
ANFAUNA-14 was returned to her cell. Two hours later the interrogation
vas resumed.
13. ABAD picked up where he had left off, and asked AMFAUNA-14
what connection she had had with Angel BRINGAS. AMFAUNA-14 said that
she had known BRINGAS no better than she had known NEGRET. ABAD said
that she was lying and urged that she cooperate. AMFAUNA-14 promised
that she would cooperate. ABAD said that NEGRET had told the DSE that
AMFAUNA-14 had had sexual relations with BRINGAS, and AMFAUNA-14 denied
the allegation.
14 The interrogation was again interrupted, and AMFAUNA-14 was
returned to her cell. When she returned to the interrogation room,
she saw that ABAD had an envelope containing what she recognized to be
papers taken from her apartment, including airline passenger manifests,
deciphering material, instructions for using the deciphering material,
and insurance policies and personal papers belonging to AMFAUNA-1.
AMPAUNA-14 now realized that it was time for her to pretend to

cooperate with the DSE, as AMFAUNA-1 had briefed her to do in such a
situation.
15. ABAD began by telling her that she was in a very serious
situation, because he knew that she had had very close connections
with a KUBARK agent. ABAD asked whether AMFAUNA-1 was identical with
"Julio." AMFAUNA-14 said that AMFAUNA-1 had been known as "Julio."
ARAD then wanted to know whether NEGRET had been working with "Julio."
AMPAUNA-14 denied this. ABAD asked whether NEGRET had known "Julio."
AMPAUKA-14 denied this too, but volunteered the information that "Julio
had provided NEGRET with mail facilities, and that AMFAUNA-14 had been
the cutout between them. Did NEGRET know of "Julio's" existance, ABAD
wanted to know. AMFAUNA-14 said that he and not, that she had brought
NEGRET mail and money which she had gotten from "Julio," and had picked
mail up from him and delivered it to "Julio," but that NEGRET had
never known "Julio's" identity.
16. The truth about AMFAUNA-14's relations with NEGRET and BRINGAS
according to her statements to her KUBARK case officer in November 1963
in the JMWAVE area, is as follows:
(a) In about mid-1963, AMCOG-2 asked AMFAUNA-14 to serve as
cutout between herself and an unidentified agent, and AMFAUNA-14
agrood. AMFAUNA-14 was driven to the meeting site, which was on the
sidewalk in front of a textile factory near Calle 100 in Marianao, by
ANCOG-2's chauffeur, a Spaniard named "Segundo, This agent introduced
himself to AMFAUNA-14 only as "El #NEGRO", and AMFAUNA-14 described
horself to him as an employee of an unidentified embassy. For contact
purposes, "El Negro" gave her the telephone number 29-4900 or 20-4900.
(b) Later, when AMFAUNA-14 began to trust "El Negro" more,
she gave him the telephone number of her mother. She learned that
"R1 Regro's" true name was als Braulio VILLAR Negret, and that he
lived in a small room in the rear of the textile factory. The telephone
number which he had given her was always answered by a woman whose
name she learned to be "Maximina."
(c) VILLAR Negret was born about 1928, and was about 5'11"
tall with broad shoulders and a strong build. He had black wavy hair
brown eyes, an olive skin, and a face marked by acne. AMFAUNA-14
never learned anything about his family directly from him, but DSE
officers told her that he was married with one child, and that hie
parents lived on a farm in Pinar del Rio Province. SUBS. IS INDOLUCO

(d) VILLAR Negret was a member of the Acción Revolucionaria
Democratica, which AMFAUNA-14 understands to be a successor organization
to the AAA of Aureliano SANCHEZ Arango. He had formerly belonged to
an action component of this organization, but more recently had de-
pvoted himself to intelligence collection. AMFAUNA-14 brought him in-
structions and money from AMCOG-2, and picked up his intelligenceнхаус
roports which she delivered to ANCOG-2. She understands that AMCOG-2
sent these reports via diplomatic channels to Frank PAEZ inMiami FLA, USA
wag. 19 tyre delivered them to an individual identified only as El

1 Negro was in mid September 1963 when he passed her a report which
he said concerned missile base, and a book on Communist infiltration
in Colombia.

(e) Once when "El Negro" was sick the sent his cousin to

(f) According to what the DSE officers told her, "El Negro"
vas arrested about 1 October and was to be shot. AMFAUNA-14 asked her
DSE interrogators whether it would not be possible to reindoctrinate
"El Negro" instead of shoot him, but they told her that it was not
worth the trouble because "El Negro" was a person of low morals who

be shown to Angel BRINGAS when and if he is caught.
(g) On 12 or 13 October 1963, after AMFAUNA-14 had been re-
leased, she was telephoned at her place of employment by Angel BRINGAS
who told her guardedly that "El Negro" had been arrested and said that
he would like to send a female cousin of his to talk to AMFAUNA-14. А
meeting was arranged in the home of AMFAUHA-14's mother. The female
cousin, whose name was "Gladys", told AMFAUNA-14 that BRINGAS had gone
into hiding and wondered whether "the family with which she worked"
(the ABCOGS) could help him get into asylum. AMFAUNA-14 said that she
doubted this. "Gladys" told AMFAUNA-14 that, in case it were possible
to do anything for BRINGAS, she should telephone "Gladys" with an
innocent message. It was understood that a meeting would take place at
1000 hours on the same day of the telephone call at the Ten Cent Store
83rd between 10th and 12th in Vedado. AMFAUNA-14 does not remember
Gladys telephone number which was left with her mother.
(h) In spite of what AMFAUNA-14 told the DSE, AMFAUNA-1 had
had nothing to do with NEGRET. AMFAUNA-14 had told this story to pro-
tect ANCOG-2. NEGRET had known that AMCOG-2 was involved, and had once
had a meeting with her in her home. Nevertheless, AMFAUNA-14 briefed
ANCOG-2 on the cover story which she had told the DSE and told her that,
in case she were ever arrested and questioned, she should admit having
talked to NEGRET in her home, but deny having been involved in the
communications channel or knowing anything about it.
Station Comment: Luis Braulio VILLAR Negret appears to be
identical with Luis NEGRE Villar (born 4 November 1930 in Consolacion
del Sur, Pinar del Rio), who is carded as ACSI source No. 492 and
appears in AMBUD correspondence as National Coordinator of the Accion

17. ABAD appeared to be particularly interested in how NEGRET and
"Julio" obtained their funds, and kept returning to this subject during
the interrogation.
16. ABAD then addressed himself to the contents of the envelope
and a suitcase found in AMFAUNA-14's apartment. He commented that all
these things appeared to belong to AMFAUNA-1 and his son, and asked how
they happened to be there. AMFAUNA-14 replied that AMFAUNA-1 and his
son, together with AMFAUNA-3, had been hiding for a few days in her
apartment because their usual hiding place had become unavailable.
19. ABAD wanted to know how and when AMFAUNA-14 had first met
AMPAUNA-1. ANFAUNA-14 replied that she had met AMFAUNA-1 in about
February 1962, that AMFAUNA-1 had regularly parked his car in a lot near
her office and that they had seen each other on the street frequently,
that ANFAUNA-1 had finally spoken to her, and that a friendship had
developed which finally turned into a love affair. (Comment: This was
a lie told to conceal the fact that it had been AMCUTLER-2 who had in-
troduced them.) She said that AMFAUNA-1 had been her lover until about.
July 1962 when she broke up with him because he was too busy with
clandestine work to pay the proper amount of attention to her.
20. ABAD asked what part AMFAUNA-14 had played in AMFAUNA-1's
clandestine activities. AMFAUNA-14 replied that AMFAUNA-1would some-
times telephone her late at night to invite her to go out for a ride,
and she would then find that AMFAUNA-1 was going out to have agent
meetings and wanted her along for cover. ABAD asked whom AMFAUNA-1 had
boan meeting. AMFAUNA-14 mentioned a person known as "Gustavo" and

gave the physical description of AMFAUNA-24, whom she knew to be safely
out of Cuba. (She never knew AMFAUNA-24's true name.) She also mentioned
Manolo VILLAMANAN, the true name of AMFAUNA-13 (whom she had known
only as AMFAUNA-1's business partner but when she thought she could
safoly mention now that he was out of Cuba,) For good measure she added
a notional name and physical description.
21. Referring back to AMFAUNA-1's automobile, ABAD asked what
kind of a car he had driven. AMFAUNA-14 replied that it was a gray
Chevrolet Impala. She repeated that AMFAUNA 1 had formerly parked it
near her office, but said that she had not seen it recently. ABAD
asked where AMFAUNA-l's red car was, and she said she did not know. He
asked what the license number on this car was, and she said she did not
know. He never asked anything about the third car which AMFAUNA-1 had
obtained.
22. ABAD commented that the DSE had observed AMFAUNA-1 in his
automobile in the Havana dock area on 1 January 1963, having a meeting
with another person. (AMFAUNA-14 recalls that this other person was
AMPAUNA-24, and that he and AMFUANA-1 had rendezvoused in the dock area
after an attempt to pick up AMFAUNA-1's radio.
23. With reference to the KUBARK agent known as "Julio", whom
they had recently identified with AMFAUNA-1, ABAD said that he knew
that "Julio" had left Cuba in October 1962 and believed that he had
gone to Europe, but he said he did not know whether "Julio" had gone
clandestinely or legally.
24. AMFAUNA-14 was asked about AMFAUNA-l's subsources in other
provinces, but she said she knew nothing about them.
ABAD said he was
sure that ANPAUNA-1 had a good source on the Tale of Pines. Whose war
name night be "Raul". ABAD also mentioned the name of a person who had
been shot about two weeks previously and who he believed had been work-
ing with AMFAUNA-1. (AMFAUNA-14 does not remember the name of this
person.)
25. ABAD asked if AMFAUNA-1's son had helped him in this clandes
tine work. AMFAUNA-14 replied that the son had been with AMFAUNA-1
frequently, but that she thought it was only because he was helping
AMPAUNA-1 with his business and that the son probably had had nothing
to do with clandestine work.

could tell him spontaneously, and he intimated that there might be a
chance for her to rehabilitate herself.
37. ABAD asked her where the passenger lists came from. AMFAUNA-14
replied that they had been left in her apartment by AMFAUNA-1, who
intended to instruct her later by SW what to do with them. She said
that AMFAUNA-1 had trained her in this system, and had left her his
materials, so that he could use her as a stop-gap communications link
while he was trying to reorganize his net.

28. ABAD told her that this was plainly not true, because some of
the lists were dated later than AMFAUNA-1's departure date. He said he
supposed they had been brought to AMFAUNA-14's apartment by AMCUTLER-2,
who had been observed coming there on 5 October with Lolip CORREOSO.
(This was true, according to AMFAUNA-14. AMCUTLER-2 and Lolin CORREOSO
had brought the passenger manifests to AMFAUNA-14's house at about 1630
or 1700 hours on 5 October, and had stayed about fifteen minutes. AT
1400 hours that same day, AMFAUNA-14 had had a meeting with AMFAUNA-39,
the first in two weeks, initiated by AMFAUNA-39 by means of a telephone
call to AMFAUNA-1's mother who was serving as cutout between them.
ΑΚΡΑΙΝΑ-39 had called the meeting to ask whether she had received any
instructions from AMFAUNA-1 as to how to act in case of an internal
uprising, which a number of people in Cuba seemed to be expecting about
that time as a result of the dost caused by Hurricane Flor NO.

28. ABAD told her that this was plainly not true, because some of
the lists were dated later than AMFAUNA-1's departure date. He said he
supposed they had been brought to AMFAUNA-14's apartment by AMCUTLER-2,
who had been observed coming there on 5 October with Lolip CORREOSO.
(This was true, according to AMFAUNA-14. AMCUTLER-2 and Lolin CORREOSO
had brought the passenger manifests to AMFAUNA-14's house at about 1630
or 1700 hours on 5 October, and had stayed about fifteen minutes. AT
1400 hours that same day, AMFAUNA-14 had had a meeting with AMFAUNA-39,
the first in two weeks, initiated by AMFAUNA-39 by means of a telephone
call to AMFAUNA-1's mother who was serving as cutout between them.
ΑΚΡΑΙΝΑ-39 had called the meeting to ask whether she had received any
instructions from AMFAUNA-1 as to how to act in case of an internal
uprising, which a number of people in Cuba seemed to be expecting about
that time as a result of the dost caused by Hurricane Flor NO.

(The DSE interrogators never at any time mentioned AMFAUNA-39, or asked
her about this earlier meeting, BO AMPAUNA-14 concludes that she had not
been under intensive surveillance that day; either AMCUTLER-2 had been
under surveillance on 5 October, or she herself had been under some kind
of periodic spot check.)
29. ABAD asked AMFAUNA-14 how she had become acquainted with
AMCUTLER-3, and AMFAUNA-14 replied that she had met AMCUTLER-2 through
AMFAUNA-15, the wife of a cousin of AMFAUNA-14 who is a prisoner on the
Isle of Pines.
30. ABAD then asked AMFAUNA-14 where her SW materials were, which
surprised AMFAUNA-14 because she had thought they had been found during
her house search and were part of the incriminating envelope which ABAD
was holding. AMFAUNA-14 told ABAD where to look for the materials, and
he sent somebody to get them.
31. ABAD wanted to know how AMFAUNA-1 and AMFAUNA-3 had gotten out
of Cuba. AMFAUNA-14 said she did not know. She said she understood they
were to get their instruction on the street
