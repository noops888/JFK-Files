17. January 1975
1. In 1960 the writer developed ami recruited Jose Raul Martinez
Hurez (201-281382), a Cuban national and a ranking Cubana Airline pilot.
2. Mr. Martinez requested an emergere meeting on 18 July 1960 to
advise thet he was the likely choice to pilot a chartered Cubana Airline
flight fron Havana, Cuba to Prague to pick up Raul Castro Ruz and his
official party. On 20 July Mr. Martinez reported that the flight to Prague
was scheduled for 21 July and that he would definitely pilot the aircraft.
Headquarters and appropriate field stations along the flight route were
advised of the flight schedule; requirements were requested.
3. On the morning of 21 July Headquarters sent a TOP SECRET RYBAT
OPERATIONAL INMEDIATE cable (DIRECTOR 40923 OUT 98941, 21 July 1960) to
the Havana Station advising that "possible removal of top three leaders
is receiving serious consideration at Headquarters" and requested the
Station at its option to contactor. Martinez and determine his willingness
to cooperate in arranging an accident during the return trip from Prague.
The cable said that Headquarters would be willing to offer a payment after
successful completion of $10,000.00 or a reasonable amount in excess of that.
4. Fr. Javes Ho Noel COS Havana, instructed the writer to meet with Mr.
Fortines and make known our interests. The writer contactei Cr. Martinez)
and arranged a cmergency meeting which took place in Mr. Martines personal
vehicle while driving to the airport. Mr. Martines said he would take a
calculated risk but limited the possibilities which could pass as an accident.
At one point Mr. Martinez askel for assurance that in event of his death
the U.S. Cov-riment would see that his to sons were given a College education.
This assurance was given orelly. On returning to the Station the writer
wes udvised that an OPM cable (DIECTOR 40965 OUT 99096, 21 July 1960) had
beon received at the Station directing the Station to disregard the earlier
instructions.
5. Cr. Ertive was debriefed by the writer after his return from
Prague, He recorte that he had to opportunity to arrange an accident, such
ve ve had discussed prior to his departure. I do not recall telling
Contipor tart the original instructions hui been changed and I an inclined

6. Mr. Jartica defected in early December 1960. I saw hir once
in early 1961 in Mami, Florida where he had taken up residence. I do
not know if any other Station officers were knowledgeable of this incident
although it is probable that bir, Arthur Avignon, DCOS (now retired and
living in the Washington area) may have read the pertinent cables.
