(ARRB) Reviewers
Attached is Scott Nann's note on INFOSEC procedures.
It appears that the ARRB reviewers will be able to take lap-
tops in and out of the building as long as security
requirement for handling classified diskettes and Classified
PCs are met. HRG will have to maintain the proper logs and
forms.
I propose we implement Situation #33 (board reviewers
can carry their own SECRET Laptops daily in & out of the
building). Establishing procedures for a LOG and the Form
4261 should not be a problem. We will need 2 or 3 HRG
staffers with media badges to fill out the form 4261 or to
escort the Board reviewers out of the building.

Dear Mr. Pereira: Joh
As we previously discussed, please initiate the necessary action to grant the appropriate
SCI clearances for Carolyn Carpenter, SSN
Ms. Carpenter's file was
reviewed by the Department of Justice Personnel Security Office. The DoJ
recommended granting a Top Secret clearance and postponing a decision on SCI
pending a CIA review for special exception to DCI Directive 114, paragraph 5C, due to
foreign in-laws.
As you may recall from our conversation, Ms. Carpenter is a former CIA employee. I
would like to request that the investigation for her SCI clearance be given careful
consideration. It is extremely important to the Review Board that our clearances meet
the highest standards of the agencies with which we have dealings.
The Review Board has informed Ms. Carpenter that her employment is contingent upon
receiving the appropriate clearances. Therefore, I respectfully request that her case be
given top priority. If you need further information, please contact either me or Tracy
Shycoff, our Deputy Security Officer. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

SUBJECT:
Secrecy Agreements with Commission Members
1. At your request, PRD searched its files to find information on how secrecy
agreements have been handled vis a vis members of commissions dealing with
intelligence-related matters. There have been three instances of PRD interface with such
commissions. The first was in 1994 when the Joint Security Commission requested a
PRB review on its report on Counterintelligence and Security Policies, Procedures and
Practices in the CIA in the aftermath of the Ames affair. There is no mention of
Commission membership or secrecy agreements in our files, and, in fact, the Commission
report was finally and properly re-reviewed by a different entity for official
declassification.
2. PRB was also asked to review the final report of the Commission on the Roles
and Capabilities of the U.S. Intelligence Commission (Brown Commission) in 1996.
Again there is no record of secrecy agreements with Board members in our files.
3. Finally and most recently, the Rumsfeld Commission to Assess the Ballistic
Missile Threat to the United States was established in 1998, and its members signed
secrecy agreements. John Hedley, PRB Chair, spoke with the members in March,
explained pre-publication requirements and emphasized the Board's and staff's
willingness to provide guidance and prompt responses to Board members. Since that
time, four of the nine Commission members have submitted a total of 12 manuscripts for
review.

Ramona,
ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATIONS
The following represents a summary of where we currently stand regarding the issue of
whether secrecy agreements were ever signed by the Assassination Records Review Board ("the
Board"), and offers options to address that issue. Thus far, CIA security officials have conducted
diligent searches, both internally and externally (FBI, White House), to locate any secrecy
agreements that members of the Board may have signed. Those searches have been unsuccessful
to date, no secrecy agreements have been found. We now intend to search selected Agency
records systems to see if there exists any reference to, or indication of, particular secrecy
agreements that the Board members may have signed. We also will attempt to locate any secrecy
agreements the Board staff signed to see if that leads us to any secrecy agreements the members
may have signed. At this point, however, the likelihood that these actions will bear fruit are not
good.
Our primary goal in this situation is to preserve our prepublication review rights with respect
to future writings of the Board members, in order to prevent the inadvertent release of classified
information (since it is unlikely that any member of the Board would knowingly reveal classified
information). Before considering the options set forth below, it is worth noting that whatever >
approach we take with the Board, we may encounter some hostility and resistance due to the
Board's unhappiness with our position concerning the final statement of compliance that we
submitted to the Board. With that in mind, our options are:
>
1. Do and say nothing, and hope that the Board members will voluntarily submit any future
writings for prepublication review.
2. Provide a generic security exit briefing for the Board which mentions their continuing
obligation not to reveal classified information in any way, without specifically mentioning
prepublication review, and again hope that they will voluntarily submit any future writings for
prepublication review.
3. Provide a specific security exit briefing for the Board which expressly mentions that they
have an obligation to submit for prepublication review any future writings they plan to publish
(related to their work as Board members) as part of their obligation to protect classified information,
ADMINISTRATIVE - INTERNAL USE ONLY
13-00000
ADMINISTRATIVE - INTERNAL USE ONLY
and hope the Board members do not ask for the source of this obligation (since we cannot provide
them with any signed secrecy agreements). In essence we bluff the Board. (**A variation of this
approach would be to have the Board execute an SCI debriefing statement, which includes a
prepublication clause, although it is limited to SCI material**)
4. Have the Board members sign secrecy agreements on the way out. This option would
be difficult to implement as there would be no incentive for a Board member to sign it (there exist
no sanctions for not signing), and it would be legally unenforceable (since the agreement would
provide a benefit to the Agency, but not to the Board members, and therefore would not contain the
legal consideration necessary to establish a binding contract). We would have to hope that the
question of enforceability issue is not raised - essentially, amounting to another bluff.
5. We can rely on language in the Snepp case, as interpreted by the Department of Justice
in the mid-1980's, that appears to permit the Agency to write a regulation that requires
prepublication review of the possibly classified writings of non-CIA personnel given access to CIA
information, to allow the DCI to protect intelligence sources and methods. The regulation would be
signed by the DCI, and then the Board would be briefed on their responsibilities and obligations
under the regulation.

to, or indication of, particular secrecy agreements that the Board members may have signed. In addition,
we are attempting to locate any secrecy agreements the Board staff signed to see if that leads us to any
secrecy agreements the members may have signed. At this point, however, the likelihood that these
actions will bear fruit are not good. Moreover, this effort has been complicated by the fact that, at the
outset, the FBI was given responsibility for the security clearance process relating to the Board.
Our primary goal in this situation is to preserve our prepublication review rights with respect to
future writings of the Board members and staffers, in order to prevent the inadvertent release of classified
information (since it is unlikely that any member of the Board or its staff would knowingly reveal classified
information). The last meeting of the Board will take place on 23 September, and the Board will be out of
business as of 1 October. If we wish to address the Board on this issue as a group, the 23 September
meeting will be our last opportunity to do so. Otherwise we will have to deal with each Board member and
staffer individually, if at all. Before considering the options set forth below, it is worth noting that whatever
approach we take with the Board, we may encounter some hostility and resistance due to the Board's
unhappiness with our position concerning the final statement of compliance that we submitted to the
Board. With that in mind, our options are:
1. Do and say nothing, and hope that Board members and staffers will voluntarily submit any
future writings for prepublication review.
2. Provide a generic security exit briefing for the Board which mentions their continuing obligation
not to reveal classified information in any way, without specifically mentioning prepublication review, and
again hope that they will voluntarily submit any future writings for prepublication review. Board members
and staffers sign nothing.
3. Provide a generic security exit briefing for the Board which mentions their continuing obligation
not to reveal classified information in any way, and also makes available our prepublication review services
to assist them in this regard, if requested, with respect to any future writings (related to their work as Board
members or staffers). Board members and staffers sign nothing. The success of this option depends
upon the willingness of Board members and staffers to voluntarily submit any future writings for
prepublication review.
4. Provide a specific security exit briefing for the Board which expressly mentions that they have
an obligation to submit for prepublication review any future writings they plan to publish (related to their
work as Board members or staffers) as part of their obligation to protect classified information, and hope
the Board does not ask for the source of this obligation (since we cannot provide them with any signed
secrecy agreements). In essence, we bluff the Board. Board members and staffers sign nothing.

5. In lieu of a security exit briefing, send each Board member and staffer a letter which expressly
mentions that they have an obligation to submit for prepublication review any future writings they plan to
publish (related to their work as Board members or staffers) as part of their obligation to protect classified
information. This approach would make it more inconvenient for the Board to probe for the source of this
obligation (which we would be unable to produce since we have not found any signed secrecy
agreements). Again, we bluff the Board. Board members and staffers sign nothing.
6. Ask Board members and staffers to sign secrecy agreements on their way out. This option
could be difficult to implement as there would be no incentive for a Board member to sign it (there exist no
sanctions for not signing), although Board staffers have indicated they would support this approach.
Generally speaking, a secrecy agreement signed on the eve of separation from government service would
be legally unenforceable (since the agreement would provide a benefit to the Agency, but not to Board
members or staffers, and therefore would not contain the legal consideration necessary to establish a
binding contract). However, in this case, if the agreement was modified to indicate that it merely reduced
to writing understandings which had been previously agreed to by the Board, we would have a strong
argument the agreement was legally binding. Of course, this option would alert the Board to the fact that
