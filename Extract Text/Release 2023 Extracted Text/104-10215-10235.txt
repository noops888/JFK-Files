Cardenas y Aranguren, a pathologist at University of Havana, and
interrogated him with regard to Cubela and Juan Pedro Carbo Servia,
in connection with the slaying of Lt. Col. Antonio Blanco Rico of
Servicio de Inteligencia lilitos.
SIM (Batista's Security Force). Cardenas admitted that Carbo Servia
had arrived carrying a machine gun and that he hid both for 4 days.

Cubela was his intimate friend. Source: Ours, from Cuban govern-
ment official. Also reported that Carlos Prio Socarras, former
President of Cuba, had helped Carbo and Cubelz to escape from Cuba.
This was reported by Avance (newspaper) on 30 November 1956.
1959: "Raul CASTRO Ruz is a known homosexual, and in 1959 in Raul's
home in the Camp Columbia Hqs, Raul and Cubela were surprised while
making obvious homosexual advances toward one another. Cubela later
fell into disgrace with the regime. It is not kuown whether this was
due to his unsatisfactory performance as a student leader or whether
he had had a "Lover's Quarrel" with Raul. Source: Latin American
revolutionary who lived in Cuba until August 1962 and personally met
high Cuban officials. (Ed Note: Perhaps his performance as one-half
of the homosexual tean was unsatisfactory!!?)

This report called him an individual without principles or scruples,
greedy, ambitious, and one who would betray the regime without qualms
should it suit his own interests. OPS #1139. (Ed Note: We must have
put this report out, for another card said the following: Among his
victims were Miguel Angel QUEVEDO y Lastra, the former editor of the
weekly magazine BOHEMIA (now in exile in the US and working for us;
however, it is true that QUEVEDO is and was openly known to be a
homosexual, and one Dr. Cardenas, fnu, Chief Surgeon of the University
Hospital. However, it appears to the editor that source is speaking
of Dr. Armando de Cardenas Aranguren, a pathologist who admitted
homosexual relations with Cubela during an interrogation by SIM after
the killing of Lt. Col. Antonio BLANCO Rico. However, there is no
doubt that Cardenas still considered himself a friend to Cubela and
as late as 1961 was trying to help get Cubela out of Cuba; this would
hardly be true if Cubela had been blackmailing him for years. There
are other indications that they appear to be good friends. In any case,
this type of blackmail could work both ways the individuals con-
cerned could put the same charge against the blackmailer, no?;
December 1960: Following derog info subject: Gained prominence FEU
(Federacion Estudiantil Univrstario) through Raul Castro. Common
knowledge that he sold out morally and poltically to Raul. Subject
actually shared quarters with Raul and much talk of homo relationships.
Subject became sort of mediator between Connie and anti-Commie groups
in University of Havana after January 1959. But soon his lack of
character and political force became known and Raul forced him upon
FEU as President in November 1950. Traditionally subject should not

1961: Ris girl friend, Sonia CALERO Sansana, suspected G-2 agent
attended marijuana and cocaine parties at home of Police Chief
Efigenio Almeijeras in 1961. Whether Cubela also went is not a matter
of record, although Almeijeras was friendly enough with Cubela to be
one of the witnesses at Cubeia's wedding in August 1959.
Cubela went to Mexico to represent Fidel Castro at the exercises of
the graduating class of the School of Political and Social Sciences
at the Autonomous University of Mexico. Although he arrived too late
for this, due to missing a plane connection from South America, he
represented Fidel at the National Agricultural School in Chapingo.

identical twins, Roberto and
Guillermo VERDAGUER Boan, via interrogation center, 319th Military
Intelligence Battalion, Fort Hood, Texas.
January 1962: An eminent physician who arrived from Cuba as an exile
told FBI that Cubela probably changed his mind about defecting be-
cause he was afraid that he would be incarcerated in an immigration
detention camp. Source told FBI that Dr. Armando de Cardonas y Aranguran
entered the USA in August 1961 and was held for two months in the
I&NS detention facilities at McAllen Texas. Source said considerable
commor gossip to effect that Cubela was Cardenas' "boy friend".

President of the FEU and was made to resign in favor of Ricardo

meetings in 1962 in Europe, one cannot say whether Cubela has a hidien
bent in this direction (homosexuality) but if so, he is not solely
