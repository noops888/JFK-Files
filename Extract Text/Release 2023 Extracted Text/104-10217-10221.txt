CONTACT AND DEVELOPMENT
1. INDICATE HOW, WHEN, WHERE, AND BY WHOM SUBJECT WAS FIRST CONTACTED OR DEVELOPED.
In response to Headquarters requests, London Station officer George H. Katzenbach
contacted Subject in London in mid-January 1965 for the purpose of debriefing him on
his experiences in the pro-ChiCom milieu in Africa and Western Europe up to the time
of his departure from the staff of Revolution in Spring 1964. This was followed up by
in-depth debriefing sessions carried out by Katzenbach in a PBSWING conference room
on 17,18,19 and 23 February. On the basis of these talks it was decided to recruit
Subject for a test assignment in Algiers during the summer of 1965 during which time
he would attempt to build long-term access and cover for reporting on activities and
personalities in the Afro-Asian community. KUDESK/ICG staffer Joseph S. Tiffany
was dispatched to London TDY 1-7 June for this purpose. After recruitment and
agreement to LCFLUTTER examination, Subject was introduced to his Paris-based Case
Officer, Rufus F. PODIGAST, on 3 June.
2. INDICATE WHETHER SUBJECT COULD BE TURNED OVER QUICKLY AND IN A SECURE MANNER TO ANY RESPONSIBLE CASE OFFICER FOR
HANDLING. IF SO, INDICATE TO WHOM.
Yes. To any Case Officer introduced to him by RODIGAST, TIFFANY or
KATZENBACH.
3. LIST OTHER CASE OFFICERS WHO HAVE HANDLED SUBJECT OR WHOM HE KNOWS OR HAS KNOWN. GIVE NAMES BY WHICH THEY HAVE
BEEN KNOWN.
KATZENBACH - known to Subject as "Earl Wilson"
TIFFANY - "Robert 'Bob' Gustke"
RODIGAST - "Paul Weller"
SECTION VI
MOTIVATION AND CONTROL
1. ESTIMATE SUBJECT'S MOTIVATION. (Be detailed; preferably cite evidence. Do not use stock comment such as "an
opportunist".)
Subject's lack of funds and a job are of primary importance. His need for
cash (evidenced to some extent by his attempt to peddle articles to China Quarterly,
Encounter and Atlantic Monthly in the fall of '64) was critical. But of even
greater significance is his desire to effect his long-range rehabilitation in order
not to be stuck in the morass of the impecunious and "morally fraudulent" extreme left.
2. INDICATE WHAT CONTROL, IF ANY, EXISTS OVER THE SUBJECT. (If no control, or if there is a lack of real control,
explain.)
For the rest of his life. Also important in Subject's motivation is the sense of
adventure connected with "The Game", which is enhanced by his desire to deceive
(to put one over on) those persons, such as Verges, who exploited and deceived him.
Subj. evinces deep contempt for these professional revolutionaries and what he
refers to, with feeling, as their "moral fraud".
Control exists quite strongly in the area of Subject's material welfare and
need for rehabilitation.
SECTION VII
COVER
1. COVER USED BY SUBJECT AND CASE OFFICER IN THEIR MEETINGS.
Subj. explained to his wife that "Wilson" (Katzenbach), who telephoned his home,
was an American publisher's representative. Subj. and Rodigast will use a journalist/
literary agent cover in the unlikely event their clandestine meetings are compromised.
2. COVER USED BY SUBJECT IN OBTAINING HIS INFORMATION AND IN CONTACTING HIS INFORMANTS.
Freelance journalist, author. sympathetic list
3. INDICATE SERVICE FOR WHICH SUBJECT THINKS HE (Will work) (Is working).
KUBARK
SECTION VIII
INTELLIGENCE CONNECTIONS AND TRAINING
1. EXPLAIN SUBJECT'S KNOWN PAST OR PRESENT CONNECTION WITH ANY OTHER INTELLIGENCE SERVICE. INDICATE THE EXTENT
SUCH CONNECTION IS KNOWN OVERTLY.
Subj. applied for association with KUBARK in 1950 and again in 1960; his enemies
have tried to discredit him by calling him a KUBARK agent, but there is good evidence
that this rumor campaign has not hurt him among his friends, even his friends on the
extreme left of the political spectrum. No known I. S. connection.
2. LIST OTHER INDIVIDUALS (Agents, relatives, friends) WHO KNOW OF SUBJECT'S PRESENT INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES.
None.
3. EXPLAIN ANY TRAINING SUBJECT HAS HAD IN CLANDESTINE OPERATIONS.
Basic security tradecraft briefings in London, 1-7 June 1965;
SW training in Paris, 14 June 1965.
SECTION IX
COLLABORATION POTENTIAL
1. INDICATE OTHER FOREIGN POWER SUBJECT COULD BE MOST LIKELY TO COLLABORATE WITH BECAUSE OF HIS IDEOLOGY OR PAST
ASSOCIATIONS. EXPLAIN.
British. Subj. resided in London from June '64 to June '65. His wife is
a British subject.

SECRET
SECTION X
OPERATIONAL USE CONTACT
1. IF SUBJECT HAS BEEN USED OR CONTACTED BEFORE, INDICATE ACTIVITY IN WHICH HE HAS ENGAGED AND THE TYPE OF INFOR-
MATION HE HAS FURNISHED.
In December 1963 Subj. was interviewed by a consulate officer in Paris for
information on Lee Harvey Oswald, who reportedly had some contact with the Fair
Play for Cuba Committee. Subj. was completely co-operative and the interviewer
suggested follow-up, but the contact was dropped.
2. INDICATE HOW AND FROM WHOM SUBJECT OBTAINS INFORMATION.
Subj. elicits information from his broad circle of friends and acquaintances
in the Afro-Asian/liberation movement areas.
3. INDICATE WHAT HAS BEEN TOLD SUBJECT AS TO THE DISPOSITION OF INFORMATION HE FURNISHES.
Nothing.
4. DETAIL SUBJECT'S PROPOSED FOR CI TYPE USE OR DUTIES.
Subject will operate under free lance journalist cover to develop contacts
in the target milieu of Afro-Asian "Anti-imperialist" activity and solicit informa-
tion from them on their activity, plans and views. It is possible that such
contacts may lead to a possibility of employment or association with some organ-
ization in this field, but whether or not he will be instructed to accept will
depend on the specific nature of the job and similar factors which cannot be
anticipated now.
5. DETAIL SUBJECT'S PROPOSED PP-PM TYPE USE OR DUTIES.
No PM duties or use is anticipated.
situation: Selective CA exploitation within his cover
i.e., as a provocateur or means to surface anti-Soviet material
from a "National Liberation" standpoint will be continually possible.

1. DETAIL SUBJECT'S PROPOSED LIAISON TYPE CONTACT OR OPERATIONAL USE:
None.
2. WHERE SUBJECT IS AN OFFICIAL MEMBER OF A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT:
None.
3. WHERE SUBJECT IS AN OFFICIAL MEMBER OF ANY OTHER AGENCY:

FOR COMMODITIES, SUBSIDY OR OTHER METHOD, SPECIFY AND GIVE DETAILS.
See Section VIII. In addition it is set forth in the Letter of Agreement
with Subject, that KUBARK will compensate Subject for any relocation of his family
required by virtue of an approved change in place of employment.
2. EXPLAIN ANY PROMISES, OTHERWISE NOT COVERED HEREIN, MADE TO SUBJECT. (Example: Commitments regarding evacuation
of subject and family.)

Subject is a rather cynical intellectual. He has a keen sense of what is in his
best interest, however, and there is every reason to believe that he considers a
reliable and secure performance for KUBARK to be in his best interest. He showed
a good sense of security in communications during his recruitment period. LCFLUTTER
examination 13 June 1965 revealed no deception by Subject.
6. EXPLAIN ANY SITUATION OR INDISCRETION IN WHICH SUBJECT MAY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WHICH MUST BE EVALUATED FROM A
CI/OPERATIONAL SECURITY VIEWPOINT.

On 18 June 1965 STEBONY/1 met KUBARK Career Agent Rufus F. RODIGAST
in Paris in accordance with instructions and for the next three days underwent
debriefings, briefings, an LCFLUTTER examination, and training in preparation
for his summer 1965 assignment to Algiers. At the conclusion of this period
LCPIPET felt that S/1: had absorbed sufficiently the guidance given him,
had responded satisfactorily to Case Officer control, was apparently clear of
and was motivated to perform creditably throughout his three-
month trial employment.

Personally, S/1 appeared to understand and to follow good security
practices by and large, but he was concerned that his wife now suspected him
of being "up to something" of which she did not approve. In short, his overall
long-term security appeared nearest to loose. Nevertheless, he appeared
highly confident that previous denunciations to which he had been subjected
would not "stick" and that he could rapidly reestablish himself among revolutionary
circles.
His relationship to KUBANK over the longer period has apparently
been of considerable interest to him, to the extent that he stated he would be
interested in some sort of career status with KUBARK (with retirement benefits)
and perhaps one day a "less covert" position. At this time in our relationship
with S/1, however, LCPIPIT is concerned primarily with what to do with his
on 1 September 1965. In fact, in view of the 19-20 June developments in Algiers
and the possible postponement of most of the activities S/1 was to cover in
efforts to reestablish himself as a legitimate propagandist for national liber-
ation movements, KUBARK may find it not only feasible, but necessary, to revise
S/1's initial KUBARK mission.
In the days and weeks to come we will be reporting S/1's progress as
he relates his accomplishments and problems through S/D communications and in
meetings with RODIGAST. We shall be submitting recommendations on S/1's longer-
term utility to KUBARK as we have more information upon which to make some
judgments. We know that Headquarters will be subjecting the STEBONY operation
to constant evaluation and analysis throughout the summer, and we will appreciate
continued and coordinated guidance on how best to exploit the unique potential
represented by this asset.
1. LCPIPET SUPPORT FOR THE STEBONY OPERATION
1. On 3 June 1965 STEBONY/1 signed a letter of agreement with
ODFONE in London, in effect a contract with KUBARK. Upon signing the letter
of agreement and agreeing to undergo an LCFLUTTER examination, S/1 was introduced
to Rufus P. RODIGAST, a KUWOLF Career Agent based in Paris who had been designated
S/1's outside case officer. RODIGAST is known to S/1 under the alias "Paul
Weller." RODIGAST met at length with S/1 on 3, 5, and 6 June and made arrangements
for S/1 to meet him in Paris 12 June and undergo further training, briefing,
and security processing prior to embarking on a trial assignment of some 10 weeks.
2. On 12 June 1965 S/1 made contact with RODIGAST in Paris in
accordance with instructions and was taken immediately to
for
debriefing on his 8-11 June trip in
and for training in the use of
RODIGAST's Contact Report on this meeting and his report of
the debriefing are included in Attachment 3 (USC). S/1 was passed $200.00
for travel arrangements for his trip to North Africa. (See also PALP 4057).
3. On 13 June S/1 again met RODIGAST in accordance with instructions
and was taken to his LCFLUTTER examination at an LCPIPIT safehouse. The results
of this examination were forwarded in PALP 4056. In short, the outcome of the
examination was considered satisfactory for the proposed operational use of S/1.
4. On 14 and 15 June RODIGAST again met with S/1 for further
debriefings on the latter's contacts in Paris. RODIGAST then briefed him on
KUBARK requirements for SW and passed on the requirements for SW training
forwarded in DIR 18107 and DIR 18675. RODIGAST's reports on these meetings
are also included in Attachment 8 (USC). On 14 June S/1 was passed $500.00
as an advance on his per diem and travel expenses for his next meeting with
RODIGAST. RODIGAST considers S/1 an apt student who learned the SW system
well in some two hours of instruction. Paris KUBARK Officer DONARY noted
some carelessness on S/1's part in the test messages, and this was subsequently
brought to S/1's attention in the overall security briefing he received from
RODIGAST.
5. The next RODIGAST contact with S/1 is scheduled for 15 July in
Rome. (See OPLA 2538 for LCPIPIT's request for Rome Station support.) In
view of the events that have just taken place in Algiers the meeting may well
be concerned as much with rethinking S/1's operational objectives for the
period following 16 July as with debriefings, briefings, and passage of funds.
Even though latest indications are that
will proceed as scheduled,
it is questionable whether the
or the
will be
held in Algiers this summer. Moreover, there is no assurance at this writing
that MEMINCE will not be either postponed, canceled, or moved elsewhere. Add
to this the possibility that IDEN A might be on the scene profiting from the
sudden rise in the political fortunes of his friends, and Algiers suddenly
loses some of its appeal as an area in which to carry out a meaningful test
of S/1's operational capabilities. The next three weeks will tell us much
and perhaps allay many of our apprehensions.
6. Nevertheless, RODIGAST must be prepared to handle a number of
eventualities in his 15 July meeting, not the least of these being a possible
revision of S/1's mission. The following possible alternatives present themselves:
we ask Headquarters to address its attention to these and to other
developmental targets and to cable recommendations and guidance prior to 13
July:
7. The second RODIGAST meeting of the summer with S/1 is tentatively
scheduled for the second week in August, site to be determined. Headquarters will
know that S/1's wife is expecting their third child o/a 11 August and that S/1
intends to be in London at that time if at all possible. Although he told
RODIGAST he would forego a visit to London at that time if it were operationally
necessary, he would find it difficult to justify his absence to his wife unless
he were to have a truly plausible and urgent cover assignment. We must therefore
anticipate in all likelihood that S/1 will be out of action for most of the
second week of August. In any event, RODIGAST will probably be able to meet
S/1 somewhere in Europe when S/1 returns to be with his wife and will at that
time hope to be in a position to discuss with S/1 the best employment of his
talents for the balance of the three-month contract period and to pursue with
him his longer range utilization as well. Headquarters' views, then, are needed
both with respect to the weeks immediately following the 15 July meeting
referred to in the previous paragraph as well as with respect to the post-
August period.
8. Administratively, LCPIPIT has so far funded S/1 to the extent
of $700.00 and has initiated action to have his salary and nonaccountable
operational advance deposited to his
These payments are
being made in advance because of S/1's initially pressing financial needs.
It is our understanding that the 1 July and 1 August 1965 deposits of $600.00
will be effected securely and on time through
to S/1's
(see DIR 20944 and DIA 21703). Action was also taken to clarify the
question of S/1's per diem. We have received his initial accountings for travel,
per diem, and operational expenses for the period 8 - 12 June.
9. On the basis of information available to LCPIPIT, S/1 has received
the following payments from KUBARK since he was first contacted in London by
George H. KATZENBACH in January of this year (we have no record at hand of the

In addition to his present
salary of $500.00 per month and his $100.00 monthly nonaccountable advance for
operational expenses, S/1 is entitled to the following under the letter of
agreement he signed 3 June 1965:
a) necessary expenses incurred in connection with such operational
travel as may be directed or authorized by ODYOKE.
b) operational expenses in excess of $100.00 monthly nonaccountable
advance as are specifically authorized by ODYOKE.
c) compensation in an amount mutually agreed upon for the relocation
of S/1 and his family to a new residence if such relocation is considered
desirable by S/1 and ODYOKE.
d) per diem at the rate of $20.00 per day during periods of
authorized travel (i.e., during absence from London).
11. PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT
12. At this stage in KUBARK's relationship with STEBONY/1 it is
well to note certain factors that must be taken into consideration as
we devise a longer-term operation centered on his capabilities and potential.
For the sake of brevity, if not precision, we will discuss these factors under
the following heads: Motivation and Handling, Avoidance, Security, Termination, and KUBARK
Operational Requirements.
PERSONAL ASSETS:
13. STEBONY/1, as has been noted in OPLA 42,750, really astonishes
with the breadth of his personal information and understanding... For
African affairs (especially in left-wing fields), European Trotskyists and
Communists and their general milieu, and Chinese-oriented international front
organizations. Similarly, he appears to be informed on certain ChiCom efforts at
subversion and propaganda in Latin America. Combined with this knowledge and
understanding is a long list of personal contacts in left-wing revolutionary
circles and a reputation as an articulate and committed agitator for national
liberation movements.
14. The Agent exudes an air of self-confidence and presents himself
well and dynamically in interpersonal relationships. He has demonstrated talent
as a working journalist, especially as a reporter. While we have limited infor-
mation here upon which to base an evaluation of the accuracy and thoroughness of
his reports, they have tended to be consistent on the whole and reveal the workings
of a mind capable of storing many vast amounts of information and recalling it
with minimal stimulation. S/1 seems to have good command of the French language
and can get by in Italian and Spanish. He has had considerable experience
in international travel, apparently accommodating well to various degrees
of discomfort and hardship as the case may require. He is able to use cameras
and tape recorders operationally, and he quickly learned S/W techniques.
15. Because of his coloring and facial characteristics S/1 can
pass relatively unnoticed as a North African, Near Easterner, South Asian,
or American Negro, inter alia. He gives the impression of being able to
strike up casual friendships readily and easily.
MOTIVATION:
16. This is a sticky area open to considerable speculation at
this point, though there are specific actions and statements on the part of
S/1 indicating he has sought some professional relationship with KUBARK for
several years. He understands, for example, that he tried to establish contact
with KUBARK while a student in Italy in 1951-52, that he appeared to be more
cooperative when questioned by PBS in Paris in relation to the assassination
of President Kennedy, and that he took a calculated (?) risk by writing indirectly
to KUBARK in the summer of 1962 offering his services. In his contacts
with KUBARKers since January of this year he has given every indication of
being forthcoming and, apparently, sincerely interested in cooperating with us.
One has the impression he was hoping to be recruited, and he certainly didn't
play hard to get.
17. Now that he has signed a letter of agreement, undergone an
LCFLUTTER, and been passed a considerable amount of KUBARK money he may
consider himself already "on the team," though in effect he was told specifically
at the outset that he had to prove himself over the next three months. He
has intimated to RODIGAST that he would like to parlay his present association
with KUBARK into a long-term career relationship including retirement,
insurance, etc. He has even alluded to an interest in working for RODIGAST's
"service" in a "less covert" capacity sometime in the future.
18. One hard question rests with all of us concerned: Why?
In his early talks with the London Station and again in his talks with RODIGAST
and TIFFANY the Agent has indicated some degrees of disenchantment with the
organizations and personalities, if not the ideology, of the left-wing faction
with which he had been so intimately involved. He has never gone so far as
to renounce his birthright and citizenship, nor does he consider himself
disloyal after several years of professional anti-KGB activity. He
intimates that he would someday like to return home, though he doubts he
would be allowed to live down his past and start a new career in KGB.
19. On the basis of information available to us we could not
say that S/1 is or ever was an ideologically committed Marxist-Leninist.
We might say that he has nurtured over the years a smoldering prejudice
against the "in" group, both domestically and internationally. He has been
an "out" most all of his life, and he has shown a strong attachment to the
causes of the downtrodden Cubans, the colonially oppressed Africans, the
organizationally subdued "young Turks" of orthodox communist and other leftist
movements, etc. There is no question that in his sympathy for such causes he
overstepped the bounds of reason and good sense, but it is doubtful that he
actually committed any treasonable offense. One has the feeling that S/1
really sought to hedge his bets on the revolutionaries by putting out feelers
to KUBARK.
20. There is a strong case for the argument that hard cash plays
a significant role in motivating S/1 to cooperate with KUBARK at this point
in time. All reports emphasize that he was not just broke, but deeply in
debt, when he began talking to London Station. Subsequently he has been
receiving what amounts to a salary at a rate somewhat in excess of average
for a European journalist, let alone a professional full-time revolutionary.
Since he has had no valid cover story for anything other than the first
advance(s) from KUBARK, we cannot be sure that he has let his wife, his in-
laws, or his immediate circle of associates know the extent of his newly-
acquired affluence. He is quite capable of thinking big operationally and
has implicitly stated that it takes money to move in Algiers and that "poverty
is no virtue in the "Third World"".
21. But S/1 does not appear to be an out and out mercenary.
There must be other factors than money alone that would lead him to cooperate
with KUBARK. It could well be that he is reacting philosophically to an
outlook on life that let him down despite years of devoted cultivation. In
the long debriefings he rarely, if ever, mentioned anyone who he felt had
really accomplished anything as a professional left-wing revolutionary. There
are indications that he regards his
