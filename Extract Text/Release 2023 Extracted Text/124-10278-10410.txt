The Movimiento Insurrecional de Recuperacion
Revolucionario (MIRR) is an anti-Castro action group headed
by Orlando Bosch Avila of Miami, Florida, which claimed
credit for several bombing raids over Cuba in August and
September, 1963.
On December 11, 1963, a source who has furnished
reliable information in the past advised that Bosch is making
plans for a bombing raid of an oil refinery at Nuevitas,
Camaguey Province, Cuba. A twin-engine Beechcraft reportedly
will be used and the raid is tentatively scheduled for the
night of December 14 or 15, 1963, from Bimini in the
Bahama Islands.
Bosch reportedly has made arrangements through an
American businessman, who was a prisoner of the Castro regime
in 1959, to buy or rent a Beechcraft twin-engine plane which
is located at Orlando, Florida. Bosch stated he is paying
an American pilot to transport the plane from Orlando to
Bimini on an ostensible pleasure flight. The American pilot
will be accompanied by his wife or girl friend. After landing
at the airfield, which is located on an island adjacent to
Bimini, the pilot and his wife will register at a hotel in
Bimini. The time of the departure of these individuals from
Orlando is unknown to the source but he presumes it will be
the same day on which the bombing raid is scheduled or
possibly a day or two earlier.
(JFK)
Bosch has indicated that the pilot, the copilot and
the two crewmen who will participate int the bombing raid will
be transported by a fast boat from the Miami area to an airstrip
near Bimini and are scheduled to arrive there under cover of
wes/w
darkness on the night of the bombing maip. Bosch has disclosed wes

that seven or eight fifty-pound demolition bombs will be carried
on the raid. The source in this matter presumes that the bombs
will be carried in the boat together with the participants.
Information previously received has indicated that
the airport near Bimini is usually not manned by airport officials
after sundown and it is possible for planes to take off and land
there under cover of darkness without being cleared or observed.
The source further advised that Bosch has issued
instructions for the plane to depart Bimini at 1 ạ.m.; bomb the
target at about 3:30 a.m.; and return to Bimini at 6 a.m.
British authorities have been advised of this
information. (U)
