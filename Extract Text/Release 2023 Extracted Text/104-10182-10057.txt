Rostedt immediately recognized him, approached the taxi which Sübject had left and
re-entered, looked hard at Subject who caught the significance of Rostedt's extra-
ordinary attentions, ordered the taxi around the corner, paid him his due fare, and
re-Joined Rostedt. It was at this moment that Friganza returned on intuition.
The trio then went to lunch, taking a circuitous route by foot and taxi. Cver
lunch from about 13-15 hours Rostedt had an opportunity to acquaint himself with
Subject and to put to Subject several questions concerning willingness and the job.

After lunch Friganza and Rostedt decided that under the circumstances it would
be advisable to keep Subject in Faris rather than risk his arrest travelling between
Paris and Ambert or returning to Gap to have his carte d'identite, revalidated.
Accordingly while Rostedt spent the next is hrs. or so with Subject, Friganza
returned to the Paris Station where he asked for the use of 15 rue Weber safehouse.
Paris Station had committed the safehouse for the night of 6 and 7 April as well
as the morning of 8 April but beginning late afternoon 8 April the house was
assigned for the use of AEASPIC. Arrangements were made to have Platipodis who
knows Subject to be at the safehouse at 1650 hours (alternate 2530 hrs.) on 8 April.
Subject was Instructed to go to the safehouse, ring 3 longs, 2 short, whereupon
he would be admitted by Platipodis. He was likewise given the name John Sandor and
told that in the event of unavoidable nquiry he should claim that he had been lent
the apartment by Tom Brown, a friend of John Sandor. He was instructed not to
answer the phone and not immediately to answer the door. If after persistent ringing
he felt obliged to answer the door, he should pretend he had drunk too much wine,
was cleeping heavily, and should come to the door appearing groggy. Subject was
further instructed to stay in the sarehouse during daylight hours and to venture out
at night only if necessary to buy food, eat, etc. He was told that Friganza would
return for him sometime between land 16. April.
Between 6 and 8 April Subject will stay with Annick.During the day he will
avoid the house, going to movies, etc., appearing only at night to sleep.
Subject was paid Francs 49.874 (exactly 8700).

Report
Date 25 March 1959
The undersigned arrived in Paris on the morning of the 25th of March and went to
the safehouse where the LEFLUTTER operater had spent the night and was shortly
to meet Subject at the Cafe Les Sport near the Port Maillot. Subject passed by
as we were having coffee and according to instructions waited elsewhere. We
left while the operator collected Subs and tock him to the house, enabling
to return at about 11 hours.
returned
Subject was dismissed for lunch at about 1145, whereupon the operator and
the undersigned returned to the Embassy office where after a quick lunch the
questions for the examination were written. The operator met Subject, ret
to the house, and began the examination at about 1430, it having been agreed
we would appear at the safehouse promptly at 1630. be did this to find that the
operator had not concluded the examination but there was sufficient time to
continue which he did. The examination was completed about 1845 hours, whereupon
we were informed by the operator that in his opinion Subject was not attempting
to deceive on any important points, even though some of the more prosaic aspects
of his biography continue to defy logical acceptance.
We then discussed future meeting arrangements with Subject: Subject will
appear in front of the Cafe Georges V on the Champs Elysees at 1214 and 16 hours
on 6 April. He will wait for five minutes in front of the cafe but will hot:
enter. If we are not there he will return for the alternate. In any event
alternate contact will be made through Annick. Subject was instructed to clear
up his affairs in Ambert and be prepared to depart for Germany; however, it was.
also explained to Subject that we were not authorized to make a final commitment
to Subject and that much as we regretted this, this would be left until 6 April.
Subject was paid Francs 15,500 for which no receipt was obtained since we were
in a hurry to catch a plane for the Hague. If Subject has any difficulties he
will write Annick. He will not return to Gap. He expects to stay with Josef
Dassaud in Ambert until the night of 5 April when he will travel to Paris by
train. It was further agreed that on or about 4 or 5 April Subject will have
sent a letter to Annickfor "Mike" in which he will conform his arrival and in
double talk inform us if he has had any trouble.
We discüssed with Platipodis of the Paris station the need to send "Maurice"
to Annick on 4 or 5 April to see if Subject had written.

20 March 1959: Upon the receipt of DIR
the undersigned borrowed a car
from om the Paris station on
on 19 March and drove that night to Moulins, s; arriving about
9 o'clock. From the principal hotel in this town a call was made to Subject who
was informed that we would arrive at Ambert at about 12 o'clock, and we we agreed to
set at the railroad station at 1200 hours. We proceeded to Vichey where we changed
clothes and bathed and arrived at Ambert about 1220 -- Subject was waiting. He re
urned the car lent by Dassaud, one of his business partners, to the residence cum
work shop at 14 rue St. Josef. We waited outside for Subject who came out, got
into the car and we drove to a restaurant which we left immediately as it was too
crowded and returned on foot to 14 rue St. Josef house where our conversati
held. Incidentally, Subject showed the undersigned around the work shop and
demonstrated how the machine and the
was
for it are made. One cannot
help but marvel at Subject's ingenuity and ability as a tinkerer and pseudo-sort
of engineer. He said they are producing about 300 a month, sell a few more than
this at 48,000 francs a piece (nearly $100). However, Subject gets no Income other
than pocket money, free room and board where he now lives, and will not receive
any until the capital outlay of his other two partners has been amortized. Taking
the bull by the horns we explained to Subject the delay: A telegram had been sent
to "certain colleagues" in Paris who were supposed to write a letter to be for-
warded to Subject. The man to whom the telegram was sent was on leave and upon
return he was not notified of the telegram we sent; consequently, Subject was not
informed as he should have been. We are terribly sorry and hope that Subject would
appreciate, such a minor matter. In any event we reminded Subject that he had not
een promised a letter on or about 1 February but rather told that he could expect
hear from us then. Subject agreed this was .so.
Subject was far less interested in explanation than a decision. He rhetorically
asked whether he was acceptable, adding he was obliged to assume he was not, and
commenting that although there are "many two legged people in America also" he
thought he was probably a unique persom from the point of view of language ability,
experience as an operator in dangerous situations, etc. We replied thus: One man
(the psychologist) has already come all the way from the States just to see Subject
and another was on his way. From this subject could fairly conclude the importance
"Headquarters" attaches to Subject's candidature and that far from being a dead
issue, Subject's prospects were good, although all depended on him.
We then turned to the matter of Subject coming to Paris. Subject explained
that Paul (
) had been sent by the Paris station
to Annick and had not done very well. He had failed to convince Annick that he was
sent by Mike (Friganza) and apparently although we did not go into the details of
this, he did not get the message straight. In any case Subject immediately said
that he could come to Paris anytime although he would be obliged to travel
illegally. This because he had permitted his identity document to expire as of 14
February 1959. However, Subject felt he could make the Journey by train without
being caught because the police are not checking most trains. He did not want to
travel by car because he had heard there are occasional road blocks (this may be
true for the undersigned ran into one on the drive from Paris to Ambert). Subject
also said he could stay as long as need by but it was absolutely essential "that he
not be obliged to stay at a hotel
he could either stay with Annick or at a place
put at his disposal by us.

event that it is needed for the 6 April meeting in Paris with Subject. Per
cables from Headquarters Rostedt is empowered to decide whether Subject should
be brought to Germany and if so, it would save one extra trip to Paris if this
document were carried by the undersigned to the 6 April meeting so that he
could be brought directly to Germany.

Report
Date 25 March 1959
The undersigned arrived in Paris on the morning of the 25th of March and went to
the safehouse where the LEFLUTTER operater had spent the night and was shortly
to meet Subject at the Cafe Les Sport near the Port Maillot. Subject passed by
as we were having coffee and according to instructions waited elsewhere. We
left while the operator collected Subs and tock him to the house, enabling
to return at about 11 hours.

Subject was dismissed for lunch at about 1145, whereupon the operator and
the undersigned returned to the Embassy office where after a quick lunch the
questions for the examination were written. The operator met Subject, ret
to the house, and began the examination at about 1430, it having been agreed
we would appear at the safehouse promptly at 1630. be did this to find that the
operator had not concluded the examination but there was sufficient time to
continue which he did. The examination was completed about 1845 hours, whereupon
we were informed by the operator that in his opinion Subject was not attempting
to deceive on any important points, even though some of the more prosaic aspects
of his biography continue to defy logical acceptance.
We then discussed future meeting arrangements with Subject: Subject will
appear in front of the Cafe Georges V on the Champs Elysees at 1214 and 16 hours
on 6 April. He will wait for five minutes in front of the cafe but will hot:
enter. If we are not there he will return for the alternate. In any event
alternate contact will be made through Annick. Subject was instructed to clear
up his affairs in Ambert and be prepared to depart for Germany; however, it was.
also explained to Subject that we were not authorized to make a final commitment
to Subject and that much as we regretted this, this would be left until 6 April.
Subject was paid Francs 15,500 for which no receipt was obtained since we were
in a hurry to catch a plane for the Hague. If Subject has any difficulties he
will write Annick. He will not return to Gap. He expects to stay with Josef
Dassaud in Ambert until the night of 5 April when he will travel to Paris by
train. It was further agreed that on or about 4 or 5 April Subject will have
sent a letter to Annickfor "Mike" in which he will conform his arrival and in
double talk inform us if he has had any trouble.
We discüssed with Platipodis of the Paris station the need to send "Maurice"
to Annick on 4 or 5 April to see if
