1. It is requested that the Operational Approval for
LINUFF-2 be cancelled.
i
2. While the Station continues to receive copies of
LIHUFF-2 publications and reports through LIHUFF-1, the Station
no longer gives financial support nor direction to LIHUFF-2's
efforts. The Station receives all information from LIHUFF-2
indirectly through LIHUFF-1; there is no direct contact. The
Station gives no direction or requirements to LINUFF-2, and
merely accepts what LIHUFF-1 passes on.
3. In view of the above, the Station feels there is no
need to retain LIHUFF-2's OA. Subject is recommended for
recontact, but anyone contacting LIHUFF-2 should be aware
that this asset is extremely biased and right-wing, and is in
dire need of financial backing for his pro-U.S. and pro-
private capital investment magazine, Espejo.

1. Attached is a book on revolutionary theory, "La Iglesia,
el Subdesarrollo y la Revolucion," recently published by
"Editorial Nuestro Tiempo" (which often publishes pro-Communist
material), which was brought to the Station's attention by
LIHUFF-1 on 22 October 1968.
2. With the exception of one of the ten authors who
contributed to this book (Karl LENKERSDORF) all others subscribe,
in one way or another, to the developing thesis that Christian
(both Catholic and Protestant) theology justifies the use of
violence (i.e., killing if necessary) to bring about basic
structural changes in the "Third World." An undercurrent of
sympathy for revolutionary "martyrs" "Che" Guevara and Camilo
Torres permeates Dost of the writings, as does the old favorite
shibboleth of Latin American "intellectuals" that the United
States has purposely kept Latin America underdeveloped (to
maintain a source of cheap raw materials and a market for
expensive manufactured goods).

:
3. In a strange marriage of "progressive" Catholic philosophy
with the old positivistic liberal tradition (which, by the way, was
quite anti-Catholic up to the days of the Mexican Revolution), this
book addresses itself to well-documented statistical studies (mostly
produced under United Nations auspices) to state the case of Latin
American underdevelopment, and then proceeds to justify violent
revolution with Christian principles on the grounds that basic
needs for human subsistence have been denied to the Latin American
masses. The Thomistic principle, that he who is starving may kill
to get food is frequently quoted; but no effort is made to define
"basic needs" in the modern world (obviously, millions of Latin
Americans are not starving to death; and there is little agreement
on what constitutes "subsistence level"). Therefore, without
defining what are "indispensable needs," most of the authors agree
that basic structural changes are required to satisfy these
(undefined) needs, and proceed to the next step: this justifies
violent revolution.
4. The problem is that most of the authors depart from a
basically Marxist-positivist point of view: the assumption that
private enterprise is incompatible with social justice, and that
only a fundamentally socialistic economy can provide the infra-
structure for an equitable distribution of wealth.
:
5. Despite the verbosity of the writers, their message is
simple: (A) statistical analyses show two-thirds of the world is
starving and lacks "basic needs of human existence;" (B) history
shows that "The Establishment" will not give in to reason;
(C) divine natural law stipulates that man has an overriding right
to satisfy his basic needs; (D) since "The Establishment" will not
give in to reason, divine natural law authorizes violent revolution
to establish an "equitable distribution of wealth." But what
system would follow violent revolution to insure equitable distri-
bution? The Marxist bias of the authors comes forth. Tomas G.
ALLAZ, French Dominican priest who teaches at the Seminario de
Leon, Gto., Mexico, frankly quotes with approval a famous passage
from "L'Osservatore Romano" of 8 May 1949: "Communism as such,
that is, as an economic system, leaving aside its philosophy, is
not against the very nature of Christianism as much as is
capitalism." In another passage, Father ALLAZ also exemplifies
the authors' anti-U.S. bias: "Children in Vietnam are cut to
pieces by the bombs of the Good Samaritans of the world."
Communist terror is nowhere mentioned. The book, therefore,
appears to be essentially an effort to justify with Christian
theology Fidel CASTRO's call to arms against the status quo in
Latin America.

Attached hereto is a full-page spread which appeared in
"Excelsior" of Mexico City on 6 August 1968. It is a paid ad
signed by Vicente Lombardo Toledano and the Partido Popular
Socialista (PPS) attacking the FBI and CIA (especially the
latter) for their alleged conspiratorial interference in Mexican
affairs. This is one more rather feeble leftist attempt to
involve U.S. agencies in the recent student disturbances. Note
that among other charges, the CIA is alleged to be supporting
the right-wing student organization, MURO.

To imagine that the Central Intelligence Agency of the northamerican govt.
would quit its activity in Mexico would be to ignore reality. The inter-
vention of CIA as a provocation and espionage agency has been uncovered
in many countries, and recently in Bolivia. Through foreign or national
assets, it has claimed to promoted anticommunist and antinationalistic
action. (etc. etc.)
Integrated with the activity of the CIA there is the continuing activity of
groups of the far right, such as HIRO, which has committed violent aggressions
and even dinamite attacks against persons, grapps and institutions of the
democratic camp. These groups have acted and continue to act with impunity.

1. During the past year the main activities of this project
(which consists of only LIHUFF/1, a WOLADY citizen contract agent)
have been aimed at:
a) Procuring reports on right wing political groups and
right-wing student organizations. These data are obtained by
LIHUFF/1 from LICHANT/1 and LIHUFF/2, both of whom are non-
paid contacts of LIHUFF/1.
b) The use of M.U.R.O. extreme right wing Catholic
student organization, principally at the Universidad Nacional
Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), with branches in several provincial
univerisities.
c) The use of LIHUFF/1 to make (business) organization
traces through Dun and Bradstreet and similar groups. LIHUFF/1
and his organization (through LIHUFF/1) are also used to
procure background, operational and investigative data needed
by the Station.
2. EFFECTIVENESS:
Some examples of the work done by LIHUFF/1 are cited below:
a) Some forty (40) Dun and Bradstreet reports were
obtained during the period on individuals and/or organizations;
of interest to this Station.
b) During this period LIHUFF/1 provided the Station
with details of Mexican Government plans to impose legisla-
tive restrictions on foreign investments and of Mexican
Government orders to Mexican Banks to limit loans to private
corporations with an appreciable amount of foreign capital.
(Note: This proved of particular interest to the Embassy).

WILL NOT BE IDENTIFIED AS A MURO OPERATION. CAN ALSO ENSURE THAT
