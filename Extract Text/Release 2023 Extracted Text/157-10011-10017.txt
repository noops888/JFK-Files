Answer, from Mr. Halpern. "Mr. Bissell said that he had
recently, and he didn't specify the date or the time, he had
recently been chewed out in the Cabinet Room in the White House
by both the President and the Attorney General for, as he put it,
sitting on his ass and not doing anything about getting rid of
Castro and the Castro regime. His orders to both Mr. Zogby, and
to me were to plan for an operation to accomplish that end."
Then at page 36 and 37, Mr. Smothers returned to the same
meeting. Mr. Smothers, at page 37, asked the question of Mr.
Halpern as follows:
Question, "Let me ask you it another way. What was your
understanding of what Mr. Bissell had been told to do by the
President and the Attorney General?"
Answer, "To get rid of Castro and the Castro regime on the
island of Cuba."

SUBJECT:
Question 3 of 4 Questions Developed during SSC
Hearing of Mr. Richard Bissell on 12 June 1975:
"A CIA cable (OUT 51708, dated 1 May 1961)
contains a paragraph that certain informa-
tion from another cable or report was to
be withheld from the Department of State.
The Committee question is, What is it that
was to be withheld? Why? Was it actually
withheld and for how long?"
RESPONSE TO QUESTION 3:
This answer is based on our assumption that the
Committee's query concerns paragraph two, OUT 51708. The
background is this. Consul General Dearborn had instructed
the Chief of Station to determine from CIA whether or not
detailed information on plans of the dissidents to undertake
the assassination of Trujillo which the Consul General had
acquired and reported to CIA (IN 44067, 30 April 1961) had
been given to the Department of State. CIA Headquarters
replied (OUT 51708) that the substantive intelligence con-
cerning the plans and identities of those who, according
to the report, would participate had been passed to the
Department of State on 1 May 1961.
In its reply (OUT 51708), CIA Headquarters appended
as paragraph two a query of its own.
With parenthetical

clarifications ded to permit easier understanding, it was:
"(Mr. John Barfield, a Foreign Service Officer
who was then assigned to the Consulate) IS NOW
HQS AREA (meaning in Washington, D.C.).PLEASE
ADVISE PRIORITY IF HE WITTING (that M 3 sub-
machine guns) POUCHED TO STATION AND IF HE AWARE
THIS MATTER NOT TO BE DISCUSSED WITH THE DEPART-
MENT OF STATE."
The Chief of Station replied (IN 44957, 2 May 1961).
that Consul General Dearborn had informed him that Mr. Barfield
was aware of the presence in the Consulate of the submachine
guns but that the Consul General, in a note sent via another
Consulate employee who was traveling to Washington at the
same time, had asked Mr. Barfield not to talk about them to
Department of State personnel unless queried (presumably by
authorized officials). The cable included the suggestion
that CIA Headquarters ask Mr. Barfield to plead ignorance if
asked about the presence of the submachine guns and to refer
any inquiries in the Department of State to CIA,
The exchange evidently reflected the intent of Consul
General Dearborn and CIA Headquarters to limit knowledge-
ability of sensitive details to those officials of the Depart-
ment of State who were already aware. It is noted that Mr.
Barfield was in 1961 the target of tendentious regime-inspired
radio 'commentary in the Dominican Republic. -Further allega-
tions could have impaired his ability to serve in that
country.

Mr. Schwarz.
There's one case officer I think we need for
2 about twenty minutss on the Cubella thing, and I think his name
is Nestor Sanchez!
Senator Schweiker. I don't think that was the name.
The Chairman. Well, let's see if we can get Sanchez, and
then there was Pedro San Juan who can be deposed. It is a very
small item, but we should track it down.
If there are any other loose ends, let's tie them up just
as quickly as we can.
10
Mr. Smothers.
Senator, we are now trying to track down
11

13
the other addressees on the 13 August memorandum. We have
heard from three of them, and one of them is the Ambassador to
Santo Domingo, and we are sending written interrogatories.

Another one, Mr. Wilson, is in today, and we have still another
one who is in South Carolina, and we will be talking with him.

After some further inquiry, it may be necessary, we will
probably have to make a decision whether we will need to talk
to General Lansdale again. I believe we are already planning
for Mr. Maheu and if we are, we should certainly have that
picture clear in about another week.

The Chairman. Last night, Senator Tower and I met with
the leadership relative to the problem that the Committee faces
with finishing up its work on the assassination issue. It was
the strong feeling of the leadeership that the Committee should
issue a united report and that we should make every effort to

"Whether or not the zealots received direct orders from the
President or the Attorney General, they did receive orders to
eliminate Castro from power in Cuba. The secret war was a
result of that policy, and Castro's assassination, if not
specified, was a logical objective of that war. Acting on the
President's authority, JMWAVE trained several thousand Cubans
in geurrilla tactics, armed then with weapons and explosives

further that it was not the Director of Central Intelligence
which approved it, but his Deputy, at the time General Cabell.

And then it goes on to talk about the powerful

question whatsoever that based upon this memorandum for the

Chief of the Western Hemisphere Division-3 participated, that
assassination was being discussed, that it was being discussed

in a very specific sense, and that it was made perfectly clear,

as the first sentence in Paragraph 4 indicates, that the purpose
to which the exotic materials sought by the dissidents would be

put was the assassination of Mr. Trujillo?

Mr. Bissell. I do.

Mr. Dennin. Would you feel that this memorandum would have

come to your attention, either directly from Mr Holman, or
from his immediate superior, Colonel King?

Mr. Kirbow. Mr. Chairman, if Counsel will yield? Since
I was originally asked to join Counsel to do work up on the
Trujillo program, and I think he knows this too, it appears in
the record before the Committee out of the '67 Inspector
General's report and all of the cable traffic which was directed
from the Consul General to the State Department through the
CIA channels that this plan of the high explosive device was
transmitted to Consul General Dearborn, the Station Chief, who
promptly classified it as an insane idea, which, if they try
to do this, because of the heavy guard, they're going to all
get themselves killed.
And it would appear to me that if that transpired before
the memorandum, the memorandum standing on its own looks very

bad, but with this other information having been tranzmitted
back to the Dominican Republic that it was a foolish plan, it

would appear that there was no plan that they thought was
workable in the United States government.

felt that a limited member of small arms and other satorials

introduction of the materials into the Dominican Republic
would be the responsibility of the Dominican dissidents
thenselves.
The decision of the Special Group was commmmicated
to Consul Dearborn In Ciudad Trujillo, and in a letter datod

ORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Mooting with and his Cousin
1. On 15 February I went to the Biltmore Plaza Hotel in New York
registering under the name of
Cousin
and met with
and his
for approximatoly 5 hours during which we
Uscussed activities and support of the opposition in the Dominican Republic.
12. I might mention that we have recently been informed by U.S.
Consul that in his opinion30-4 is the king pin of the plot in
the Dominican Republic. I would like to say that after this and previous
moetings win ENDOCR-A I am strongly inclined to concur in the U.S. Consul's:
Opinion.
3. First off, I explained the authorization for the delivery of arms
and other materiels under cortain conditions and suggested that wo co
I said that
into the details of now such delivery might be effected.
it had boon suggested that an island cache near the Dominican Republic
could bo picked up by the internal acton groups, but the cousin and
wwlod out this possibility saying that all these islands, although
:
ply populated, are regularly patrolled by Dominican guards. They did
er agree that a boat-to-bcat delivery could be made off the coast
tho Dominican Republic from vessels under our control to fishing vessels
ned by younger members of the internal front. They said however that
lie delivery would have to be made near the mouth of a river since the
Jotters would not be able to unload on patrolled beaches out would beve to
ail up some river for some itance before the materiel could be securely
loaded.DECK played down somewhat the necessity for delivery of
rms although he did say that it is desireable and should be a part of
ho planning. Ho said that members of the opposition could, if they
anted to, obtain small quantities of arms from Army contacts from
ominican Army munitions depots but that any arms so obtained would have
o be used very quickly before their loss is discovered. For this reason,
o said it would be cosireable to have arms delivered by us that could
Do stored for use at any moment desired.
4. DECK said that terobject of obtaining this kind of holp
way is the elimination of Trujillo and instead of using ruas or
renades he began to speak of more exotic mater
