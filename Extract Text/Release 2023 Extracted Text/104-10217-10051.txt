SUBJECT: GUTIERREZ Menoyo, Kloy
1. Reference is made to the request dated 13 July 1961,
subject as above, whose name you desired checked against the
files of this office. The files contain the following inform-
ation concerning Subject.
2. A report dated 3 March 1961 from an official Spanish
service indicated that Subject's flight to Florida with funds
belonging to the Army of Spanish Liberation (ELE) was announced
on 28 January 1961 at the Second Latin American Conference for
Amnesty for Spanish and Portuguese Political Prisoners. Fidel
CASTRO had mentioned him in a speech as an "adventurer and a
gunman". However, the report added that anti-CASTRO elements
were commenting that Subject's flight with the KLE funds might
have been simply a ruse to introduce GUTIERREZ into anti-
revolutionary circles in Florida.
3. Information received in a report dated 7 March 1961
from a new and untested source indicated that Subject was
considered an agent provocateur by the anti-CASTRO groups.
These groups also believed that two of Subject's companions,
named Angel BANOS and "Kiko" PRENAS, were actually Cuban
intelligence agents.
4. From another new and untested source information dated
14 April 1961 indicated that Subject transported six tons of
weapons and explosives to Spain some time in 1960. This equip-
ment was cached in caves and tombs in the mountains of Asturias
in Northern Spain. In addition, Source charged that Subject had
also transported and hidden weapons and explosives to various
Latin American countries.
5. A report dated 27 July 1961 from an unevaluated source
revealed that in 1953 Subject and his father were denied exit
permits by the Cuban Government on the grounds that they were

Communists. Later investigation confirmed that Dr. GUTIERREZ
Zabalata, Subject's father, was a member of the Communist Third
International. Although Subject was not then of legal age, he
was considered an active participant in Communist activities.
After the assumption of power by the CASTRO Government in
January 1959, the papers regarding this matter were removed
from the files of the Department of State (Cuban) on orders
from a high government official.

are referred to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
