Three pages of penciled notes and jottings in Russian made
by NOSENKO during an early debriefing session were submitted on
25 March 1964 to CIA handwriting analysts, together with a nwater

graphologists were told only that the writer was a Russian male
aged 36, that he had a university-level education, and that he was
an intelligence officer by profession. Their report, which was
qualified due to limitations on the amount of NOSENKO's handwriting
specimens submitted to them, is quoted below.

Psychological Interrogation:
For fourteen days between 3 and 21 May 1965, the same CIA
psychologist interviewed NOSENKO on his entire early history,
from birth until about 1953, when he said he entered the KGB.
The main purposes were to collect additional information on this
period, to gain further psychological insights into NOSENKO'S
personality, and to find possible ways of obtaining a truthful
account. Although conducted under the physical conditions of
interrogation, the questioning was relaxed and followed no rigid
outline. There were relatively few changes of story from pre-
vious versions; at the same time, however, NOSENKO described in
detail some incidents which he has subsequently admitted to be
untrue. An extract from the psychologist's report of these
interrogations is given below.

3. Report by Psychiatrist
During the year April 1964-April 1965 NOSENKO was under the
medical care of a CIA psychiatrist who visited NOSENKO at regular
intervals, usually weekly, to examine him physically ard to listen
to any comments NOSENKO might have about himself and his situation.
The psychiatrist familiarized himself with available materials on
NOSENKO, particularly with reports of his behavior in the months
immediately following the defection.
A report which he submitted
on 20 December 1964 is given below.

B. Views of Intelligence Personnel
1. Statement by DERYABIN
a.
Introduction
Former KGB officer Peter Sergeyevich DERYABIN has followed
closely the entire course of CIA's investigation of NOSENKO and
his information. He took part in the interrogations of NOSENKO
in April 1964, January-February 1965, and October 1966 as an ob-
server and consultant, and he personally questioned NOSENKO during
July and August 1965 concerning certain aspects of his personal
past and early KGB career. On the basis of his direct, personal
knowledge of conditions within the Soviet Union and of KGB organi-
zation and procedures prior to his defection in February 1954,
supplemented by continuing study of later information from a
variety of sources, DERYABIN is of the opinion that much of what
NOSENKO has said about himself and the KGB is purposefully false
or distorted. Although DERYABIN has been able to offer authorita-
tive comment on many aspects of NOSENKO's story, the following
section of this paper is limited to his remarks concerning HOSEN-
KO's entry into the KGB (then. MVD) and his Communist Party affili-
ation, both of which fall into the period when DERYABIN was active
as a KGB (then MVD) staff officer. DERYABIN personally interro-
Since DER-
gated NOSENKO on these topics in the summer of 1965.
YABIN was a personnel officer of the KGB (then MGB and MVD) in
Moscow, with long experience in Communist Party activities, at
the time NOSENKO claims to have entered the American Department
of the KGB Second Chief Directorate, he is particularly qualified
to comment on these aspects of NOSENKO's story.
DERYABIN, as a Soviet Army officer, das graduated in 1945
from the higher counterintelligence school of Smersh (counter-
intelligence with the Soviet Armed Forces). Following this he
worked in Naval Smersh in Moscow and in March 1947 began to work
in the MGB as a case officer in the Central Personnel Directorate.
Shortly afterwards, when his superior was appointed Deputy Chief
of the Chief Guards Directorate for Personnel, DERYABIN trans-
ferred with him to the Guards Directorate. He served as a Guards
Directorate personnel officer until May 1952, rising through the
ranks from case officer to the position of Chief of Section.
of his responsibilities was the approval of personnel for service
in various units of the Guards Directorate, and he was also in
charge of supervising personnel and security matters concerning
one of the Directorate's surveillance sub-sections.

After requesting a change from personnel to operational
duties, DERYABIN was transferred in May 1952 to the Austro-German
Until
Department of the MGB Foreign Intelligence Directorate.
December 1952 he served as the Deputy Chief of a sub-section in
the Counterintelligence Sektor (desk) of the Austro-German Depart-
ment. He was then appointed Deputy Chief of the intelligence
Sektor of the same department, a position he held until March
1953. From March until September 1953, DERYABIN was the Deputy
Chief of the section in MGB Headquarters which was responsible
for the security of Soviets stationed in Austria and Germany.
In September 1953 he was transferred to Vienna, where he became
Deputy Chief of the section in the MVD Legal Residency respons-
ible for the security of Soviets in Austria.

DERYASIN joined the Komsomol in 1936 and remained a member
until 1940, when he became a candidate member of the Communist
Party of the Soviet Union, he became a full Party member in
August 1941. During his Party career he held a number of responsi-
ble posts. Before the war, when DERYABIN was a teacher in Altay
Kray, he was the secretary of a local Komsomol unit and simultan-
eously served as a member of the Komsomol Plenum in the rayon
where he lived. From October 1940 until November 1941 he was
Secretary of the Komsomol Committee of the 107th Engineer Battalion
of the Red Army and from June 1945 until April 1946 held the same
position in the Komsomol Committee of the Naval Smersh.
the unit which had particular responsibility for counterintelli-
gence work within the Naval GRU, which NOSENKO said he joined in
1951. In the MGB DERYABIN was a member of the Party Committee of
the Personnel Section of the Guards Directorate and, after his
transfer, was elected Secretary of the Party Bureau of the Austro-
German Department of the Foreign. Intelligence Directorate. He held
this post from January 1953 until his transfer to Austria in Sep-
tember 1953.
b. DERYABIN's Comments
This was
The following statements by DERYABIN are based on his question-
ing of NOSENKO between 26 July and 13 August 1965. The questions
asked and the statements attributed to NOSENKO (referred to as
Subject) dere during this period. Although the Soviet State Secu-
rity Service did not become known as the KGB until March 1954,
this term is used for convenience sake, except where the specific
organization of the MGB or MVD is under discussion. DERYABIN's
comments follow:
"NOSENKO'S Acceptance into State Security*
"Taking NOSENKO's own statements at face value, it is highly
improbable that a person such as he has described himself to be
would be acceptable for a position as a staff officer in State
Security. The following factors are important in this regard:
a. It was the policy of State Security to avoid hiring
the children of high government officials.
From
b. Until STALIN's death in March 1953, KOBULOV, the
man who supposedly helped NOSENKO gain entrance into the
service, had no influence inside the MGB apparatus.
about 1948 until 9 or 10 March 1953, KOBULOV had no office
inside the MGB or the MVD buildings. I know personally that
in these years KOBULOV worked in Germany as Deputy Chief of
the GUSIMZ (Chief Directorate of Soviet Properties Abroad)**
which was once directly under the Council of Ministers and
later under the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The office was
located on Chkaiova Street, near the Kurskiy Railroad
Station (three blocks from my former apartment)..
See also Part V.B.
** WISMUT A.G. in Germany was subordinate to GUSIMZ; for a
further discussion of KOBULOV's role in helping NOSENKO
join the KG3, see Part V.B.

c. It was physically impossible at the time for NOSENKO
to be recommended for and accepted into State Security, as he
has told us, all in one month, March 1953. (If one accepts
his earlier version that he had his talk with KOBULOV in Jan-
uary or February, his account is similarly impossible because
KOBULOV was not then in State security.) It would normally
have taken a much longer time, but in addition to this it was
a period of reorganization and the personnel staff was not
actively conducting their work at that time, and permanent
staff officers were not sure that they would retain their
positions.
d. In March 1953 NOSENKO was already twenty-five and a
half years old and only a member of the Komsomol. He had no
recommendation for Party membership and could not become a
member for a full year because of his transfer from one ser-
vice (GRU) to another. It is impossible that State Security
would accept him knowing in advance that on his birthday ne
would be twenty-six years old and without either Komsomol or
Party membership. Even for the son of a Minister, the Secre-
tary of the Komsomol Committee of the KGB would have to talk
with the Personnel Office and would not give a recommendation
for his acceptance, especially for the Internal Counterintel-
ligence (Second Chief) Directorate. In the case of a son of
a Minister and one who is recommended by KOBULOV, the secre-
tary would request from NOSENKO a recommendation for Party
membership from the members of the Communist Party where
NOSENKO used to work, in this case the GRU. In this way the
secretary of the Komsomol would be sure himself that NOSENKO
would become a candidate member of the Communist Party during
the next year.
"However, even accepting that despite these obstacles and
contradictions the KGB would have accepted him, one must also
remember (according to NOSENKO's own statements) that NOSENKO'S
file contained the following negative points. They are serious
factors and certain of them alone would be enough to cause the
rejection; the totality makes it difficult to believe that at a
time of crisis in the State Security organs anyone would take the
responsibility of accepting him:
a. Subject was already married and divorced before entry
into State Security.
b. He had been married to General TELEGIN's daughter
and TELIGIN had been arrested by State Security and was in
jail the day that Subject entered State Security.
c. NOSENKO said that there was a file on NOSENKO'S
father in which compromising material was collected on
Subject's family. NOSENKO agreed that one piece of infor-
mation that would have been in this file was the fact that
his maternal grandfather died in a Soviet prison while under
sentence as a counter-revolutionary.
d. The social status background in the life of Subject's
mother was nobility.

e. The shooting incident in Leningrad during World
War II and his desertion from the Naval School in Baku
would have played a very negative role in any consideration
of his acceptance into State Security.
f. Subject never completed high school in the normal
fashion.
g. Subject was a poor student at the Institute of Inter-
national Relations.
h. It should be added that the KGB would definitely
krod that NOSEIKO was involved in an automobile accident
in 1947 and was interrogated by the Militia (traffic court),
found guilty, and fined. This would definitely play a
negative role in NOSENKO's admission to the KGB.
1. NOSENKO Would never be allowed to enter the KGB having
just recovered from tuberculosis. In fact, there was a rule
at that time that no person who ever had tuberculosis (even
twenty years earlier) would be permitted to work in the KGB.
"In addition, after acceptance, the fact that KOBULOV was a
personal friend of Subject's father, as he has told us, would
have been noted in the file and would have played a negative role
in permitting Subject to continue to work in State Security after
KOBULOV'S arrest in June 1953.
I
"I asked Subject how he answered some of the questions in the
anketa (entry questionnaire), particularly the questions on his
former wife, her relatives, and on his mother's ancestry.**
then asked Subject how it was, taking into account his mother's
aristocratic ancestry, the fact that her father died in jail, the
Trotskyite allegations against Subject's father, the fact that
Subject's former father-in-law (TELEGIN) was still in jail, and
the fact that Subject was present when TELEGIN's apartment was
searched--that he had been accepted into the KGB, particularly
in 1953 during the confusion and changes after the death of STALIN.
Subject admitted that the question was logical, and said that he
could only assume that the influence of KOBULOV and the important
and influential position of his own father outweighed these nega-
tive factors. He also cited his GRU experience in this connection.
"I then asked Subject how he had reported his second marriage
to the KGB. He replied that before the marriage he had mentioned
* NOSENKO first mentioned having had tuberculosis during the June
1962 meetings, when he described it as a minor case but said he
was under out-patient treatment until 1958. He next mentioned
his illness in 1966, describing how he sometimes coughed up a
"glass of blood" at a time. Although DERYABIN's questioning
covered this part of NOSENKO's life in detail, there was no
mention of tuberculosis in July and August 1965. DERYABIN's
comment is based on the 1966 information but is included here
for purposes of context.

cussed further below.

it briefly to GORBATENKO, and that he had unofficially run a name
check on his prospective bride (which was 'clean'), and that after
the marriage he had filled out another arketa in which he included
all the required data on his wife and her relatives. After con-
siderable prompting, Subject said that he had indicated that she
and her parents had been in France, but that he had concealed the
fact that her grandmother had been in German-occupied territory
during the war. (He admitted that the KGB would have learned this

negative security factors mentioned above, adding the arrest of
KOBULOV, the fact that his new wife and her parents had been
abroad, the fact that her grandmother was in German-occupied
territory, the fact that Subject was now over-age for the Komsomol
but not yet a Party member or candidate, and the fact that Subject
received a 15-day sentence for misuse of cover documents and in-
curring venereal disease, and asked if he didn't think that his
personnel file had been reviewed in 1954, and if so, what grounds
there could have been for retaining him in the KGB. Subject said
that he thought that his file probably was reviewed but that
Subject added
again the influence of his father had saved him.
that another important factor was probably his language qualifi-
cation and particularly his higher education. I pointed out to
Subject that if his second wife and her parents had been abroad
it was impossible that her name check could have been negative.
He admitted it was illogical, but insisted that this was so.
"NOSENKO's Knowledge of KGB, 1953-54
"Entry Date into KGB: NOSENKO was reminded that he had pre-
viously given varying dates for his entry on duty in the KGB. He
replied that he did not remember the exact date, but he was sure
that it was in the middle of March 1953
perhaps 13 or 15 March
(15 March 1953 was a Sunday). He would give no explanation for
why he previously claimed to have entered the KGB in
1952. In fact it would be very unusual for a KGB officer to
forget his exact entry-on-duty date to the very day because it
is used to compute length of service and must be entered on vari-
ous forms from time to time.
"Numerical Designation of the Intelligence and Counterintelli-
gence Directorates in 1953: Asked to describe what directorates
existed in the MVD while BERIYA was Minister (March-June 1953),
NOSENKO named the First Chief Directorate (FCD) and the Second
Chief Directorate (SCD) which he said were the intelligence and
counterintelligence directorates respectively. Asked if he were
sure, NOSENKO said he was positive, and that the only change that
took place was that later, under KRUGLOV, for a few months only,
the FCD became the SCD, and vice versa.
NOSENKO stuck to this
even when told he was wrong; he did not say he did not know or
did not remember, perhaps realizing that he could not claim not
to remember what directorate he served in.
(Actually, the change
-
in numerical designations was instituted by BERIYA right after
STALIN's death in March 1953 and persisted until the KGB was
organized in March 1954. Thus, NOSENKO does not know what the
correct designation of his own directorate was at the time that
he allegedly entered on duty with Soviet State Security and for
the entire first year of his alleged service there.
NOSENKO on other occasions has given various reasons why he
told CIA that he joined the KCB in 1952. See Part V.B.

620.
"MVD Leadership, 1953-54: Asked to name the chiefs of the
directorates and separate departments of the MVD under BERIYA
and KRUGLOV, NOSENKO named nine out of 28. He was unable to name
the Chief of the Intelligence Directorate, saying that he remem-
bered only SAKHAROVSKIY (PANYUSHKIN was chief until 1955). Asked
to name KRUGLOV's deputies, NOSENKO named only ROMASHKOV ani
SEROV, and was ignorant of such prominent deputies as LUNEV and
SHATALIN. Told that a Secretary of the Central Committee of the
CPSU was one of KRUGLOV's deputies at this time (SHATALIN), NOS-
ENKO flatly denied that this was possible.
"Organization of KGB: NOSENKO did not know when the KGB was
organized (March 1954). He said that it was in early 1955 or
late 1954. Told that he was a year off and asked to think it
over, NOSENKO insisted that he was right.
He

story about how he was processed for employment with the KGB in
1953 is inconsistent with the procedures used at that time.
does not know many of the things that he should know about en-
trance procedures; he is wrong about many of the things that he
claims to remember. The disparities are so great that they can-
not be explained (as NOSENKO attempts to do) by the claim that
KOBULOV's recommendation resulted in a simplified entrance pro-
cedure for NOSENΚΟ.
"The most important document filled out by prospective em-
ployees of Soviet State Security is a detailed personal history
questionnaire, called in Russian Anketa spetsialnoco naznacheniyā
sotrudnika KGB. This exhaustive questionnaire is 16 pages long,
and filling it out is an experience that one is not likely to
forget. A background investigation is run on the basis of this
questionnaire, which itself becomes a permanent and prominent
feature of the employee's personnel file. NOSENKO remembers
filling out a questionnaire, but does not know its designation.
He asserts that it was only 4-6 pages long. He asserts that he
filled it out at home, and submitted it in two copies shortly
before entering on duty. Actually, this questionnaire was re-
quired in ore copy only, and was never permitted to be taken
home since it was a classified document (even when not filled
in).*
"NOSENKO insists that he did not have to take a medical exam-
ination prior to entering the KGB. This is not possible. Such
an examination was a routine and mandatory part of the processing.
I cannot think of any instance in which it would be waived.**
DERYABIN's views are based on NOSENKO's statements in August
1965. In his original biographical statement (1962), NOSENKO
said that no anketa was required. He implied as much in his
most recent statement in April 1966, after being questioned
by DERYABIN. This statement is given in Part V.B.

"NOSENKO's description of the secrecy agreement that he
signed when entering on duty with the KGB is completely unlike
the agreement that was in use at that time for staff employees.
It may be significant that NOSENKO's description of the secrecy
agreement he recalls signing resembles the secrecy agreements
that were taken from agents.

were a number of other routine forms that had to be filled out by
applicants and new employees.
"Location of ROZHENKO's Office: NOSENKO says that all his
entry processing was handled by a personnel officer named ROZHEN-
KO and his staff. He asserts that ROZHENKO'S office, which NOS-
ENKO visited several times in early 1953, was located on the 6th

neither ROZHENKO nor any officers or units of the Personnel De-
partment were located in the 8th entry. They were all (including
ROZHENKO) located on the 6th and 7th floors of the 7th entry of
Building No. 12.*
"Rank Pay: Asked about his salary when he first started to
work in the KGB, NOSENKO said he got a basic salary of 1700 rubles
as a case officer, 500 rubles for his rank of lieutenant, plus
He insisted that this was

correct, even hen told that KGB officers were no longer being
paid for rank in March 1953, and said that although he remembered
that there was one year--1954--when they were not paid for rank,
he was sure that when he first entered on duty he received this
pay. Salary for rank was taken away from State Security officers
in September 1952 and was not restored until April 1954.
"Promotion to Senior Lieutenant: In giving the chronology
of his promotion to various military ranks, NOSENKO claimed to
have been promoted to senior lieutenant in April 1953, shortly
after joining the KGB. Told that this was impossible, and that
no one in the KGB was promoted at this time, NOSENKO replied that
he couldn't say about anyone else but he was sure that he had re-
ceived his promotion at that time. In fact, this is impossible:
all promotions in the KGB were frozen from the time BERIYA took
over as minister (March 1953) until late 1953.
"Visitor's Pass Procedures: In talking about his first visit
to the KGB to process for employment, NOSENKO was unable to re-
call the procedures employed by the KGB Pass Office in issuing
visitor's passes. Specifically, he maintained that the name of
the interviewer was not indicated on the pass. In fact, the
name of the interviewer did appear on the pass and the inter-
viewer had full responsibility for the visitor while he was on
KGB premises. While it is understandable that NOSENKO might
have forgotten the details involved if he had only visited there
a few times more than ten years ago, if he worked at KGB-Head-
quarters for over ten years-as a staff officer and particularly
as a supervisor he would have frequent occasion to admit visitors,
and thus should know visitor's pass procedures quite well.
*NOSENKO has since said that he spoke to no personnel officers
prior to acceptance by the KGB or afterwards, thereby indicating
that his statements to DERYABIN were untrue. See Part V.B.

"Unescorted Entry into KGB Building with Visitor's Pass:
In
describing his first day at work, NOSENKO said that he went from
the Pass Office, where he obtained a visitor's pass, to the 4th
entry of the Building No. 2, where his pass was checked by the
guards, and then went unescorted to KCBULOV's office on the third
floor. Challenged on this point, he said he was sure that it was
possible to enter without an escort. In fact, it was absolutely
impossible to go through any entry of Building No. 2 without
escort if you did not have a properly stamped KGB (MVD) identity
document (see below).
"KGB Identity Document: NOSENKO was asked to describe the
KGB identity document that he received when he first entered the
KGB. He was then asked if there was anything unusual in connec-
tion with this document at that time. He replied that he knew of
nothing unusual. He was then reminded that after STALIN's death
and again after EERIYA's arrest it was necessary to have special
stamps placed in the identity documents to validate them. With-
out the right stamp it was impossible to enter the KGB building.
NOSENKO was ignorant of this and was unable to recall anything
about it despite a number of hints and leading questions.
ally, during the period of upheaval following STALIN's death and
again after BERIYA's arrest, all KGB identity documents were tem-
porarily withdrawn in order to have special validation stamps
placed in them, and it was literally impossible to get in the
KGB buildings if one did not have the right stamp. This was the
subject of numerous anecdotes at the time and is hard to believe
that an officer who served in the KGB at the time could have for-
gotten it completely.
Actu-
"Gastronom: Asked to describe the sign in front of the KGB
Club, NOSENKO said that he did not remember any sign (there was
one in 1953) but mentioned that there was a Gastronom (food store)
next to the KGB Club. Asked when the Gastronom was opened, he
said firmly that it was already there when he started to work
in the KGB. In fact, this Gastronom was definitely not there as
of 1954. It was opened sometime between 1955 and 1957, as Moscow
directories show. The KGB Club is in entry No. 1 of Building
No. 12, Dzerzhinskiy Square, and NOSENKO would have had to pass
it every day he went to work.
"Chief Directorate of Militia: Asked where the Chief Direc-
torate of Militia of the USSR was located in 1953-54, NOSENKO
replied that he did not know, and knew only that later it was
located on Ulitsa Ogareva. Actually, in 1953-54 it was located

officer in the counterintelligence directorate would have fre-
quent occasion to deal with the Chief Directorate of Militia.
"K.I. (Committee of Information): Asked where the Intelli-
gence Directorate of the MVD was located in 1953, NOSENKO replied
that it was scattered between Dzerzhinskiy No. 2, the Agricultural
Exhibition, the K.I. building, and Kiselniy Pereulok. This is
a confused and incorrect answer. Asked for clarification, NCS-
ENKO said that he had never visited either the K.I. or the First
Chief Directorate building at the Agricultural Exhibition. Thus,
NOSENKO seems to be unaware that the K.I. has not existed since
1951, and that the K.I. building and the building at the Agri-
cultural Exhibition were one and the same place.

"NOSENKO claimed to have become a member of the Komsomol
Organization (K/O) of the KGB when he entered on duty in March
1953, to have been elected as Secretary of Komsomol Organization
of the Second Chief Directorate in the fall of 1953, and to have
served in that capacity until the fall of 1954, when he was re-
moved because he used operational-alias documents in obtaining
treatment for a venereal disease he had incurred. He claims to
have been excluded from the Komsomol, without prejudice, when he
attained his 27th birthday in October 1954.
"Asked to describe how he transferred from the Komsomol Organ-
ization of the Naval Intelligence Post in the Baltic to the Kom-
somol Organization of the KGB, NOSENKO gave an entirely incorrect
description of this procedure, both as regards deregistration from
the K/O in the Baltic, and registration with the K/O in the KGB.
He stated that he was issued a new Komsomol registration card by
the KGB K/O, without reference to the previous K/O in the Baltic;
this is impossible.
In
"NOSENKO gave an incorrect account of how a K/O secretary is
elected, stating that he was elected at a meeting of the K/O.
fact, the K/O meeting can only select the K/O committee, which will
convene separately to elect the Secretary.
"NOSENKO could not describe the duties of a K/O secretary in a
specific manrer.
"NOSENKO did not know who was the secretary of the overall KGB
K/O. The secretary of the SCD K/O would be directly subordinate
to him and would deal with him frequently.
"NOSENKO was unable to describe his dealings with the KGB K/0
or the identities or responsibilities of the people with whom he
dealt there.
"NOSENKO insisted that in 1953-54, the maximum age for a Kom-
somol member was 27. In actual fact, the maximum age was 26 (it
was raised later). This point is important, both because NOSENKO
should know exactly if he had served as a K/O secretary, and also
because it refutes his story that he was excluded from the Kom-
somol for over-age in 1954.
"NOSENKO maintained that all the members of his K/O paid dues
in the amount of 2 percent of their monthly salaries. This is
incorrect, as monthly Komsomol dues were calculated on a sliding
scale determined by wage group: at that time, Komsomol members
earning up to 500 rubles monthly paid 0.5 percent: those earning
500 to 1500 rubles paid 1 percent, and those earning over 1500
rubles paid 1.5 percent. The K/O secretary collects the dues,
and must know the right amount.
