Reference is made to memorandum dated 12/9/63, from Mr.
Wannall to Mr. Sullivan. Pursuant to instructions, the Liaison
Agent furnished Austin Horn, CIA, two copies of a memorandum on
12/10/63. At the same time, the CIA representative was asked to
inform us (1) whether CIA has facilities for establishing contact
with the subject at Gander, Newfoundland and (2) whether CIA
desires information concerning possible contact with subject be
passed to him prior to contact Horn furnished the following to
the Liaison Agent on 12/11/63.1)
(U)
collaborations (U)
Under existing agreement with the RCMP, CIA would not
be able to establish contact with subject at Gander without brief-
(U) ing the RCMP concerning the background of this matter. (It would
then be necessary to handle the contact with RCMP collaboration.
CIA is interested in the potential offered in this matter but would
prefer to explore the possibilities of contact with subject in
another country. Since the memorandum disseminated by the Bureau
indicated that subject has occasion to fly to Mexico and Europe,
CIA would like to have additional details concerning subject's
flying schedules to those particular areas. CIA would also like
to know if the subject speaks English.
A search of CIA files by Horn disclosed the following
information. In February, 1962, a "fairly reliable source" described
the subject as a communist. The source did not furnish any other
details.
(4)
In March, 1963, a CIA source of unknown reliability char-
acterized the subject as a "fanatical supporter of Castro." This
same source suggested that subject might try to penetrate Castro
