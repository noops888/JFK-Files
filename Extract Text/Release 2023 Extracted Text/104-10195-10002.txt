1. Action Requested: Your approval is requested to
extend the services of Thomas B. CASASIN (P) under a Memoran-
dum of Oral Commitment for the period 1 July 1975 to 31 December
1977. The only compensation to CASASIN would be money equiva-
lent to shipment costs for a maximum of 1,000 pounds of personal
effects from Paris, France, to the United States. Since CASASIN
is an Independent Contractor, the amount of money given CASASIN

1924, has been employed by the Agency since 1949. Twelve years
of this period were spent as a Staff Employee, seven of which
were at Headquarters and five years, 1955-1960, were spent in
Tokyo. In 1962 CASASIN was assigned to Paris under nonofficial

Headquarters approvals was utilized by Paris Station as an Inde-
pendent Contractor, effective 1 July 1974. His compensation was
