The joint operation for telephone tapping is is effected in cooperation
with the Mexican authorities and has a capacity for about forty lines.
The station provides the equipment, the technical assistance, couriers,
and transcribers, while the Mexicans make the connections in the ex-
24
changes and maintain the listening posts. In addition to monitoring
the lines of the communist diplomatic missions and those of Mexican
revolutionary groups, LIENVOY also covers special cases.
24
The station also has its own unilateral telephone-tapping operation
which is limited to special cases where the involvement of the Mexi- 24
cans is thought to be undesirable. Connections for this operation
are made outside the exchanges by telephone company engineers who 24
work as station agents, as in the case of the bugging of the Cuban
✓ embassy (LISAMPAN).

MICROFILM
The last regularly scheduled LIEMPTY Progress Report covering the period
1 August through 31 October 1964 was forwarded to Headquarters as Reference.
During the period under review, the LIE PTY Project continued to collect
operational information on the LMERICK installation, the LIMERICK personnel and
their visitors, as well as various targets of opportunity, through the daily photo-
graphic coverage provided by the LIMITED, LILYRIC, and LICALLA photo basehouses and
the frequent use of the LIENTRAP mobile photographic unit. In addition, this
project provided other essential operational support to the Station's activities
through the use of the services of long-time contract agents Raymond H. GERENDE
and Oliver G. SCANTLING.
2. AGENT CONTACT AND PROJECT COMMUNICATIONS.
During the reporting period, the primary LIEMPTY principal agent, Raymond н.
GERENDE was seen thirty-nine (39) times in regular operational meetings by the
undersigned, while principal agent Oliver G. SCANTLING was seen separately on
twenty-six (26) occasions. Other than frequent, intentional variations in meeting
times and sites, no changes were made in the LIEMPTY Project communication systems.
All operational contact with the action/sub-agents of the LIEPTY Project, was
maintained through Raymond H. GERENDE.
3. ACCOMPLISHMENTS, PROGRESS, AND ACHIEVEMENTS.
Throughout the reporting period, Project LIEMPTY continued to produce the
majority of the operational photographs uned in Station Mexico City's KUDESK
operations against the LIMERICK target. This coverage. has proved to be a reliable
tool for following the daily activities of LIMERICK personnel; providing identities
of LIMERICK staffers and their visitors; and verifying the relative rank and
positions as well as the intelligence service connection of LIMERICK officers.
Specific examples of the contributions of each LIEMPTY Project component follow:

a) Raymond H. GERENDE Throughout this period, Raymond H. GERENDE
continued as the Station's full-time cutout to the LIMITED,
LICALLA, and LILYRIC basehouses as well as maintaining the cutout
responsibility to the LIENTRAP mobile photo unit and the LIEMPTY
photographic-processing basehouse. GERENDE again made numerous
and essential contributions to the sensitive AMROD operation as
well as servicing numerous postal accommodation addresses.
b) Oliver G. SCANTLING SCANTLING during the reference period,
continued to make his regular contribution to Station activities
as the alternate contact of LICASA-1 in this sensitive LAURICLE
operation. In addition, SCANTLING provided detailed casing reports
on the Indonesian Embassy and the home of AMRIFT-1; performed pre-
text investigations in an effort to determine the residence, of a
key LIMERICK staffer; and successfully recruited the subject of
MEXI-2315 (dated 19 January 1965) which enabled the Station to
achieve a major technical penetration of the PBRUMEN Embassy in
Mexico City (see also MEXI-2235 dated 20 January 1965, for
additional details). SCANTLING's extremely professional performance
in this recruitment and the subsequent ticklish agent-handling of
the subject is to be commended.
c) LIMITED
:
1) As noted in paragraph 2, Section b of Reference, the LIMITED
photographic, surveillance, and radio dispatching activities were
suspended in late September 1964 due to the release of LIMITED
photographs in the Warren Commission's overt report. The Station
subsequently acquired an apartment in the immediate vecinity of
the LIMERICK installation and moved the LIMITED basehouse keepers,
LIEMPTY-6 and LIEMPTY-7, into this temporary location. All LIMITED
operational activities were then re-initiated from the new basehouse
in early January 1965 and during that month LIMITED produced 18 rolls
of 35 mm operational film, provided regular physical surveillance
reports, and served as the fixed radio dispatch base for one
LIEMBRACE surveillance operation.
2) During the interim period and as a result of separate correspondence
with Headquarters, the former LIMITED basehouse and property was sold
to LIMOSINE, who as per formal agreement with the Station, demolished
the old structure and will begin construction of a new edifice in the
immediate future. Included in this formal agreement with LEMOSINE is
the proviso that one floor of the new building will be reserved for
the Station's use. Upon completion of the new structure, the LIMITED
personnel and operational activity will be transferred from the
temporary apartment basehouse to the new, more ideally located
LIMOSINE building.
a) LILYRIC
Throughout the period under review, the LILYRIC installation
continued to provide photographic and fixed visual surveillance of the
front of the LIMERICK installation. LILYRIC provided 63 rolls of
operational photographs during this period which were of definite
value to the Stations KUDESK operations against the LIMERICK target.
LILYRIC made specific contributions to the Station's LIOYSTER-1
operation, as noted in MEXI-1473 of 4 November 1964.
e) LICALLA During the period under review, the LICALLA installation
provided coverage of the back of the LIMERICK installation, the
garden, and patio area where many of the personnel congregate. LICALLA
provided 60 rolls of 35mn still photographs as well as 600 feet of
16mm motion picture test film. Station reinitiated this motion
picture program to obtain further exemplars of LIMERICK personnel
engaged in conversation, for possible lip-reading exploitation. (For
additional details, see HMA-25155, dated 13 January 1965 and DMMA-25275
dated 28 January 1965...
f) LIENTRAP Throughout the reporting period, the LIENTRAP mobile photo-
graphic unit was targeted extensively against members and installations

of the Partido Comunista Mexicano and visiting communist leaders.
Much of this coverage, 25 rolls of 35mm film, was in support of
planned recruitment attempts and the LIENTRAP"take" was of considerable
value in providing identifications, locations, and contacts of various
targets. LIENTRAP "take" provided the positive identification and
location of the subject of HMMA-25183, dated 18 January 1965, and thus
enabled a visiting case officer to make the recruitment attempt of
this individual.
4. SECURITY AND PROBLEMS.
a) During the period under review, there have been no known incidents
which adversely effected the security of Project LIEMPTY. However, as a pre-
cautionary measure, the LIENTRAP photographic unit was repainted (a basic color
change) in January 1965. It is believed that this action will increase the
security of the LIENTRAP unit and allow it to again operate in various areas
where it had been used extensively in the past.
b) There have been no major operational, personnel, or administrative
problems in this Project during the reporting period.
5. PLANS.
a) During the past project year, many of the operational assignments,
levied on Oliver G. SCANTLING, while within the realm of the Station's RMD,
have fallen outside the scope of Project LIEMPTY. Consequently, a new Project
Outline is being prepared at the Station to cover the relationship with, and
the present and anticipated operational activities of SCANTLING..
b) Anticipated changes in the LIMITED installation/activities were out-
lined in paragraph 2, Section c above. Other than noted above, there are no
basic operational
administrative changes contemplated for Project LIEMPTY.
