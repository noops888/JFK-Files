2023 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
Office Mem
TO : MR. BOARDMAN
FROM : A. H. BELMONT
DATE: January 22, 1958
SUBJECT: COVERAGE OF MAIL TO THE U.S.S.R.
On January 10, 1958, Harry Stone of MI-5, Liaison Representative with the Bureau, confidentially advised that his service had determined that Soviet illegal agents all over the world, when they want a meet with their principal, are under instructions to send a proper communication to "K. S. Smirnov, Central Post Office, Vladimir, U.S.S.R." Mr. Stone stated (S) that the aforementioned information was being made available to the Bureau and the RCMP only.
On the basis of this information, we immediately instructed the Washington Field and New York Offices to institute confidential inquiries with appropriate Post Office officials to determine the feasibility of covering outgoing correspondence from the U.S. to the (U.S.S.R.), looking toward picking up a communication dispatched to the aforementioned address.
On January 21, 1958, SAC Powers of the New York Office called advising that his preliminary inquiries at first disclosed that such coverage could possibly be effected at LaGuardia Airfield. Powers stated that he subsequently received a call from the Chief Post Office Inspector who told him that he would not be able to make such arrangements and explained that something had happened in Washington on a similar matter and that Bureau Headquarters should take up the matter with Post Office Headquarters here in Washington. The Post Office Inspector said that it did not involve our agency and because of what was going on in Washington at the present time, he just couldn't do it on his own.
Almost simultaneous with this advice, Mr. James Angleton of CIA approached our Liaison Agent, (Sam Papich) on a personal basis. He indicated that if it were known within CIA that he was volunteering this information to the Bureau, he would lose his job. Mr. Angleton stated it had come to the attention of CIA, through the Post Office, that we were making inquiries concerning the coverage of mail to the U.S.S.R., and as a result CIA was expecting to receive an inquiry in Washington from the FBI. Mr. Angleton then admitted that this coverage was one of the biggest and most secret operations being conducted by CIA. He stated the coverage is actually made through the Post Office in New York

MEMO TO: MR. BOARDMAN
RE: COVERAGE OF MAIL TO THE(U.S.S.R.)
and in view of the volume of material being sent from the U.S., their coverage is an extensive and expensive operation. He indicated that they had to set up an elaborate array of IBM machines to tally and tabulate the results. In addition a complicated indexing procedure was involved, as well as complex scientific examinations of the material.
He further indicated that the coverage has been in existence in excess of a year and he stated that the sole purpose for the coverage was to identify persons behind the Iron Curtain who might have some ties in the U.S. and who could be approached in their countries as contacts and sources for CIA. Angleton indicated that CIA had successfully developed several sources through this means. He stressed the confidential nature of his information and stated that while other officials of CIA more directly concerned with the coverage were expecting a visit from the FBI he was passing this along for our guidance.
It would appear that our inquiries of the Post Office officials in New York have flushed out a most secret operation of CIA. The question immediately arises as to whether CIA in effecting this coverage in New York has invaded our jurisdiction. In this regard, it is believed that they have a legitimate right in the objectives for which the coverage was set up, namely, the development of contacts and sources of information behind the Iron Curtain, and according to Angleton they have had some success in this regard. At the same time, there is an internal security objective here in which, because of our responsibilities, we have a definite interest, namely, the identification of illegal espionage agents who may be in the United States. While recognizing this interest, it is not believed that the Bureau should assume this coverage because of the inherent dangers in the sensitive nature of it, its complexity, size and expense. It is believed that we can capitalize on this coverage by pointing out to CIA our internal security objectives and holding them responsible to share their coverage with us. Of course, we are not interested in the identities of the numerous persons in this country legitimately corresponding abroad. The Post Office has indicated there are approximately four thousand items of correspondence to the U.S.S.R. each day. Angleton said they have not come up with a microdot or secret message communication as yet.
ACTION:
1. On the basis of our inquiries conducted in New York, we are in a position and should, through Liaison, approach CIA, informing them that it has been indicated that their Agency has coverage of mail going to the U.S.S.R. We should get from them the details of their coverage and explain our interest in being furnished with the results of the coverage as it might effect internal security matters
2. It is believed that we can and should furnish CIA with the name and Moscow address furnished us by the British, telling CIA that we want to be advised of any communications going to that address. We will not explain to them our interest in the particular address and, therefore, we will not be violating the confidence of the British.
3. In view of the highly sensitive nature of this coverage, we will have to work out arrangements so that knowledge of it is strictly confined within the Bureau. We will handle this the same as handle communications intelligence data.

Office Memorandum
TO : MR. L. V. BOARDMAN
FROM: MR. A. H. BELMONT
DATE: February 6, 1958
SUBJECT: COVERAGE OF MAIL TO THE(U.S.S.R.)
Reference my memo of 1-27-58 advising of the briefing given our Liaison Agent by CIA representatives on 1-24-58 as to the nature and extent of CIA coverage of mail going to and coming from(Russia). Our Liaison Agent determined that CIA began this coverage approximately a year and a half ago through confidential arrangements made with postal authorities. Initially, this coverage involved photographing of envelopes; these envelopes were not to be opened.
secret writing has been made to a limited extent because the volume of mail has been too numerous for the establishment of a practical system without delaying movement of the mail. CIA has advised that to date it has not discovered any microdots or secret writing or information revealing evidence of Soviet intelligence operations in the United States. CIA has also advised that this program has not reached its full potential, but that its system of opening mail is rapidly increasing. CIA has expressed a willingness to furnish us any information obtained from this coverage which we feel would be of interest to us.
An analysis has been made of CIA capabilities as revealed to the Liaison Agent and it is believed we should request that CIA furnish us information of the following types, both that which has been received in the past and that which they will obtain in the future:
1) All correspondence of a suspicious nature, such as that containing double talk, et cetera.
2) All correspondence indicating that the Soviets may be utilizing a hostage situation, i.e., correspondence indicating pressure being exerted on(Soviet)citizens who have close relatives in the U.S. or pressure being exerted on individuals in U.S.
3) Any information appearing in correspondence indicating weaknesses or dissatisfaction on the part of any Soviet presently in the United States so that the Bureau might give consideration to feasibility of approaching such individuals for defection or double agent purposes.
4) Any information appearing in correspondence indicating Soviet control or direction of the CP, USA.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Attention: Mr. S. J. Papich
SUBJECT: HUNTER Report #1
6 February 1958
1. The intercept project that has been explained orally to(Mr. Papich) will be referred to as Project HUNTER in correspondence between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and this Agency.
2. This explanatory memorandum constitutes HUNTER Report #1. Future disseminations will be numbered consecutively.
3. In submitting possible traces on individuals of interest to you, reports will be submitted in the following form:
a. If the individual named in the intercept appears to be identical with the individual of interest to you, you will be furnished a reproduction of the exterior, and of the contents if the item has been opened.
b. If the individual named in the intercept is only possibly identical with the individual of interest to you, only machine run listing of the items will be submitted. In such cases a reproduction of the exterior and of the contents, if the item has been opened, will be available upon request.
4. In order to facilitate your reading of machine run entries, there follows an explanation of the various types of replies which you will receive in connection with requests. A hypothetical request for any addressee in the U.S. of mail from(P. KROVAN) whose location is believed to be in Moscow, might result in the following reply:
Date Name In Ref Loc Name Out Ref Loc Ban Firms
A 57CO5C3325 KROVAN, Paraskoviya(*) ABB EVOSWA, Wasyl ( ) ) KM
This reply has the following meaning:
"A" has no present meaning. All numbers are now preceeded by "A" only to allow for future additional classifications. None are presently contemplated.
"57C09"is the date of intercept, namely: "57" is the year. "C" indicates the month. The code key for months is set out as Enclosure 1. "05" is the day of the month. Thus, "57C05" is 5 March 1957.
The group "C3325" is our own internal filing number.
The "Name In" entry identifies the correspondent inside the(USSR).
The asterisk in "Ref" column indicates that(KROVAN)sent the letter.
The entry in "Loc"(ation) column indicates the area or city inside the Soviet Union from which the letter was mailed. In this case it was mailed from the western section of Ukrainian SSR. The code key used for this column is set out in Enclosure 2. This code key is to be used for all items prior to 1 January 1958, on which date a 4-place code was instituted in order to designate more precisely the localities within the(USSR). A copy of this new code is enclosed as Enclosure 3.
The "Name Out" entry identifies the correspondent outside the(USSR). In both the "Name In" and "Name Out" columns, the last or family name is listed first.
The absence of an asterisk in the "Ref" column after EVOSWA indicates that she is the recipient of the letter.
The entry in the second "Loc"(ation) column indicates the state of the U.S. (in this case, New Jersey) to which the letter was addressed. The code key used for this column is set out in Enclosure 4. You will note that some 3-digit entries indicate large cities within a state, thus KO indicates New York State and KOA indicates New York City. For your convenience an alphabetical list of the states with their code indicator is set out in Enclosure 5.
The absence of an "X" in the "Ban" column means that the letter was not opened and that only the exterior is recorded in our files.
5. Since the hypothetical request was for mail from(P. KROVAN)who is believed to be located in Moscow) only the listing as set out above would be furnished, since it would not appear that Paraskoviya KROVAN, located in the western section of the(Ukrainian SSR)is identical. If in connection with future investigation or information otherwise available, you may believe that(KROVAN)may be identical with the individual of interest to you, you need reference only the HUNTER report number and request the exterior photographs of item No. A57C05C3325, which will be reproduced from the original film and made available to you.
6. If the hypothetical request is for any mail from the(Soviet Union)to Rose ESTERSON, who resides in Chicago, the reply might be as follows:
Date Name In Ref Loc Name Out Ref Loc Ban Firms
A57D23U 57D18 (AVRUNINA, Vera) (*) AAA (ESTERSON, Rose) KKB X
The difference in this listing from that previously illustrated is as follows:
"U" is our internal identifying designator. The first date is the date of the intercept. The second date is the date of the communication inside the letter. The "X" under the "Ban" column indicates the letter was opened. Again this indicator would indicate only a possible identification since KKB under "Loc" indicates California. In this instance upon request, identifying the HUNTER report number and referencing both A57D23U and 57D18 numbers, the outer envelopes and their contents will be reproduced and furnished to you.
7. Normal service of either of the above requests will be 24 hours. In an emergency we could service the request in a few minutes.
8. If your first request had been for(KROVAN, or P. KROVAN, or Paraskoviya KROVAN)located in the western section of the Ukrainian SSR)you would have initially received the photograph of the envelope. Likewise, in the second instance, if your request had been for(ESTERSON, or R. ESTERSON, or Rose ESTERSON)located in Chicago, or Illinois, you would initially have received photographed copies of the envelope and its contents.
9. In order to insure most efficient servicing of your request, it is suggested that you submit trace requests as follows: List the last name first with any known first and given names or initials, and address including state, city and street, if known. If an exact address is not known, a probable state or section will be helpful but is not required. The same would apply to the(USSR). The above should be listed on duplicate 3 x 5 cards. If only a phonetic name is known, various combinations of spellings would be appreciated, together with any other data such as probable address or area. Where an address is known and there are individuals, other than the subject, at this address to whom the questioned communication might be addressed, their names should also be given. For record purposes and in order to facilitate our answers to your request, would you in turn number each card as HUNTER Request No.
10. On each request will you also indicate whether the request is for a one-time check or whether the name should be put on the Watch List. If the latter, please indicate the duration of the Watch List, i.e., 30, 60, 90 days, or "until cancelled". If a Watch List is requested, you should also indicate the treatment desired when a possible hit is made, i.e., photograph outside only; photograph outside and contents; photograph outside, contents, and examine for S/W or microdots. Specifically indicate any Watch List item which should not be opened. In this connection you may also desire to give us a white list of correspondents of interest to you who are not Watch List subjects but whose mail should not be opened in the course of our normal openings for spot-checking for operational or intelligence information. In some instances you may desire to indicate that you are to be informed immediately when a hit is made and prior to the receipt of the letter by the addressee.
11. It is possible to make a special machine run of the names of all correspondents either addressor, addressee, or both, from any specific area in the(USSR)to the United States or to any specific state or city in the U.S., or vice versa. There are various other combinations that could be run, such as all letters mailed in Florida either on a specific date or for any given period. If the above-listed or any other type of exploratory processing is desired, a presentation of the problem will enable us to tell you immediately what we can do, how long it will take, and the amount of work that is involved. While this type of service is possible, it does involve a great deal of work and should be requested in connection with very important cases only.

Belmont to Boardman (2-6-58)
RE: COVERAGE OF MAIL TO THE(U.S.S.R.)
With regard to the above coverage, it is believed desirable that Liaison make arrangements for us to review at CIA any material of this nature and we will then select that which appears to warrant investigation and then make appropriate checks. This procedure will eliminate having CIA sending us a bunch of worthless material with the possible expectation that we will be running out leads for them. It is believed this arrangement can be worked out with CIA in a proper fashion.
In addition to the above it is believed the following arrangements can be effected with CIA:
1) Place stops against names and addresses of individuals possibly presently engaged in Soviet espionage to determine if they are in correspondence with U.S.S.R. This would include a check of the back traffic on these individuals also. We would, of course, make these stops on a highly selective basis.
2) Request CIA to place stops against addresses in Soviet Russia believed by the Bureau to be mail drops or suspected mail drops. (It should be noted that we already have placed a stop with CIA against the name and address of ), which, according to information received from Mi-5, is a drop utilized by(Soviet)illegal agents all over the world arranging emergency meetings.
We will, of course, continue to analyze this coverage by CIA to see that we obtain maximum benefits.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1) That information received from this source be hereinafter designated as Bureau Informant 200. Records Section has advised that this informant symbol has not been previously used.
2) That this matter and any mail relating thereto be labeled "June" and then filed and maintained in the Soviet Unit, Room 1734 (the regular repository of "June" mail) to afford maximum security to this source.
3) That our Liaison Agent orally advise CIA of the type of data set forth above that would be of interest to us and make arrangements with CIA so that we can review this type of information in order to select that which we feel will warrant further investigation. Liaison should also perfect the arrangement with CIA so that on a continuing basis we can place appropriate stops with them.
4) In view of the extreme sensitivity of this matter, a confirmatory memorandum will not be furnished to CIA.
