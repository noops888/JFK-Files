THE ADOULA GOVERNMENT IN LEOPOLDVILLE VIA THE UNITED NATIONS
CHANNEL THAT A FIFTH MIXED COMMISSION BE IMMEDIATELY SET UP
TO DISCUSS CONGO FEDERATION AND/PREPARE A DRAFT FEDERAL
CONSTITUTION. THIS TSHOMBE DID ON 27 JULY. AS FURTHER PROOF
OF HIS SINCERITY", AT CLEMENS SUGGESTION, TSHOMBE PROPOSED
THAT ALL FIVE COMMISSIONS MUST COMPLETE THEIR DELIBERATIONS
WITHIN THREE MONTHS, REACTING TO CLEMENS EMENS ARGUMENT THAT TSHOMBE

REGIME, TSHOMBE HAS PHRASED HIS PROPOSAL TO LEOPOLDVILLE SO AS
TO MAKE CLEAR THAT HE RECOGNIZES ADOULA AS HEAD OF THE CENTRAL
GOVERNMENT.
