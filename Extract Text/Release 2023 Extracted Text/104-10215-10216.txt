Military Ranks in Cuba
As reported 27 September 1963, ranks of the Cuban Revolutionary
Armed Forces are as follows:
Major in Chief (Comandante en Jefe)
Army Major (Comandante de Ejército)
Corps Major (Comandante de Cuerpo)
Major (Comandante)
First Captain (Primer Capitán)
Captain (Capitán)

Lieutenant (Teniente)
Sub-lieutenant (Sub Teniente)
Sergeant First Class (Sargento de Primera)
Sergeant Second Class (Sargento de Segunda)
Sergeant Third Class (Sargento de Tercera)

Spanish Names
Much of the confusion concerning Spanish names can be eliminated if
one basic fact is clearly understood: Spanish speaking people use their
mother's maiden name (matronymic) after their last name (patronymic).
For example, Fidel Castro's full name is Fidel Castro Ruz--Ruz being
the matronymic (and in this case seldom used). In this dossier the last
name is the one capitalized and will appear as
Juan GOMEZ Díaz, or
GOMEZ Díaz, Juan

CURRENT POLITICAL RELIEFS:
Until 1961-62 Subject showed a pronounced anti-US and pro-
Communist; pro-Castro bias. More recently, however, there has been
information indicating that he does not hold to his former views and
is thinking of leaving Cuba. The progression of his political
thinking is visible in the following extracts.-
:
1959: A US resident of Cuba whose source was a Cuban youth
leader reported that the swing to the left of the University Students
Federation (Federación. Estudiantil Universitaria FEU) was confirmed
by the decision made at the end of November 1959 to become a full
member of the Communist-run International Union of Students (IUS).
(However, the FEU also retained its association with the Coordinating
Secretariat, of the National Union of Students
COSEC.)
Editorial Note: Since this swing to the left of the FEU happened
only a month or so after Subject became president of that organization
it does not seem likely that he could have so quickly influenced the
predominantly Catholic university. On the other hand, one of the FEU
vice presidents, Jose VENEGAS Valdespino, vas by November heading
the Latin American Department of the FEU, an indication that the FEU
was organizing its area departments along the exact lines of the area
departments in the Cuban Ministry of State (Foreign Ministry?).
1959-60: Subject and other FEU leaders entertained a group of
Red Chinese students in Havana.
March 1960: An anti-Communist student-leader said that Subject
was neither pro- nor anti-Communist. The source felt that Subject's
only desire was to prevent discord during his term of office as FEU
president.
March 1960: In late March a Mixed Commission at the University
of Havana met to discuss the establishment of Disciplinary Tribunals.
The president of the commission, Rafael SANTOS Jimenez, and others
objected, saying the old disciplinary councils had been suspended
because more modern and efficient legislation was being studied by
the commission and it was only logical to wait until this legislation
was promulgated before establishing new tribunals. All the arguments
had no effect on Subject and Angel QUEVEDO Valdivia. Subject said he
had never seen so many Catholics and anti-Communists present on campus
"attempting to deny the existence of freedom of speech and written
expression." He added that, "everyone knows that no one is more opposed

than we are to coercion and violence." Subject and Quevedo von when
Santos changed his vote, and the tribunals were immediately established.
May 1960: Subject told a general assembly of university students
that Communist Professor Carlos Rafael RODRIGUEZ Rodriguez was doing
his duty and must be given the same respect as other professors. He
closed the meeting by scoring the counterrevolutionary attitude of
some students and said that the university could not be for "those
traitors who prefer foreign intervention in Cuba."
May 1960: Subject and his followers in the FEU leadership held
the floor at the macabre "burial" of the newspaper Diario de la Marina
and not only turned it into a vicious anti-American display but also
condemned the anti-Communist students at the university as enemies of
the revolution.
May 1960: The paper Información published a letter from Joaquin
PEREZ Rodriguez, vice secretary of the School of Agronomy at the
University of Havana, in which he stated that so-called "terroristic
activities" of anti-Communist students were nothing more than a pre-
fabricated pretext on the part of Subject's clique to justify or
rationalize strong-arm methods against all who opposed the Communist
minority. He asked how, if Subject's leadership deplored violence, it
could remain impassive when the Communist youth from the Instituto de
la Habara entered the university grounds fully armed and perpetrated
acts of violence against him (Perez). He also asked what moral
authority Subject and Quevedo might hope to invoke when they went
across campus carrying arms in direct violation of university
regulations.
June 1960: Subject was in Uruguay as a guest of the pro-
Communist-Federation of Uruguayan Students. He held talks with
Communists and gave press conference statements which included such
Communist-line items as "Fatherland or Death," "Death to Traitors,"
"Anti-Castro students serve bastard interests," War criminals are
being trained at the Yankee base of Guantanamo," etc.
October 1960: After a short trip to New York City with the Cuban
delegation to the United States a responsible US consular official
said that his presence in the United States was prejudicial to the
national interest and recommended that his valid visa be revoked.
October 1960: A State Department despatch noted that Subject's
action regarding the Embassy evacuation notice, his violent
denunciation of that notice, and his denunciation of the Embassy
itself in the local press clearly pointed out his anti-US bias.

CURRENT POLITICAL BELIEFS: (Cont'd)
December 1960: It was stated that Subject had gained prominence
in the FEU through Raúl CASTRO. It was allegedly common knowledge
that Subject had sold out morally and politically to Castro who had
forced him on the FEU as president after his lack of character and
political force became known. Between January 1959 and the time he
became president of the FEU (October 1959) he served as a sort of
mediator between Communist and non-Communist groups in the University
of Havana.
January 1961: Subject was reportedly to go to Spain in the near
future under a fictitious name and without his beard. He was
allegedly going to be chief of an action group penetrating Spain from
Cuba,.
March 1961: Subject was reportedly arrested attempting to flee
Cuba but this was alleged to be a trap for anti-Castroites, with
Subject's participation.
May 1961: Subject was a delegate to the Latin American Conference
on National Sovereignty, Economic Independence, and Peace, in Mexico
City. This conference was sponsored by Mexican Communist Lázaro
CARDENAS del Rio. Subject subscribed to the Charter of México, a
document containing anti-US resolutions.
1962: In May a report from Bern, Switzerland said Subject
wanted to flee Cuba and would try to get permission to visit some
European country and defect. In August his ex-wife was allegedly
telling friends that Subject did not intend to return to Cuba from
Helsinki, which he was then visiting. Also in August Subject
reportedly said that he was thoroughly disgusted at present with the
situation in Cuba and planned to do something about it. He stated
that "foreign-controlled Cubar assets" had tried to contact him but
"he avoided them,"
He did, however, plan to contact someone on his
next trip out of Cuba.
1962: The US Army reported that Subject controlled the students
at the University of Havana. This report said that his loyalty to the
Communist Party was uncertain. It has been said at times that he has
conspired against. Castro. It has also been stated that he speaks
against the United States to please Fidel Castro.

PRIOR POLITICAL BELIEFS:
At the time of the Batista coup on 10 March 1952 Subject was one
of the first to start working against the Batista regime in Havana
University together with Jose Antonio ECHEVERRIA Bianchi (now
deceased), Fructuoso RODRIGUEZ (now deceased), Faure CHOMON Y
Mediavilla, Juan Pedro CARBO Servía (now deceased) and José MACHADO
(now deceased).
At the time of the 1955 border incident between Costa Rican and
Nicaraguan troops, Subject went to Costa Rica together with other
members of the University Students Federation to defend Costa Rica.
When he returned to Cuba he rejoined the fight against the Batista
regime.
:
In 1956 Subject participated in the assassination of Lt. Col.
Antonio BLANCO Rico of Batista's Military Intelligence (SIM). He
defended this in a 1959 press conference, calling Batista a dictator,
assassin, despoiler of the riches of Cuba which left the revolutionary
government a legacy of a Cuban national debt of one billion dollars.
From January 1958 until Batista's overthrow a year later Subject
fought in the Escambray Mountains as one of the leaders of the
Revolutionary Directorate (Directorio Revolucionario DR) which had
made a formal pact with forces of the 26th of July Movement and with
the Second Front of the Escambray to work together until Batista was
overthrown.

1959: During the early spring Subject reportedly frankly
expressed to Fidel CASTRO his dissatisfaction with the regime.
1959: Prior to September Subject reportedly told intimates
that he was so disgusted with Castro that if he, Subject, did not get
out of Cuba soon he would kill Castro himself. Early in October his
feelings reportedly had not changed.
March 1960: Following a near riot among university students when
Communist and Radical elements, despite the efforts of the Catholic
groups, prevented by mass force the entry of anti-Communist, well-
known commentator Luis CONTE Aguero into television station CMQ over
which he was to read an opposition letter to Fidel Castro concerning
Communist infiltration. Subject declared that anti-Government
political demonstrations would not be permitted within the university
and that still less would demonstrations organized by students who
aided the counterrevolution be permitted to ascend the university
steps. If they did so, he said, they would not be able to return to
the university for they would be judged before the Disciplinary
Tribunals and condemned as traitors to the fatherland and the
revolution.
May 1960:. He told a general assembly of university students
that Communist Professor Carlos Rafael RODRIGUEZ Rodriguez was doing
his duty and must be given the same respect as other professors. He
closed the meeting by scoring the counterrevolutionary attitude of

used it to condemn anti-Communist students at the university as
enemies of the revolution.
August 1960: An article in The Reporter stated that Subject had
said: "The university cannot stand aside from the nation. The
revolution must enter the university. Incompetent, immoral and
counterrevolutionary professors must go."

ATTITUDE TOWARD REGIME: (Cont'd)
August 1960: A Cuban businessman reported that a fake anti-
government movement headed by Subject had been initiated by followers
of the regime for the purpose of infiltrating true anti-government
groups. He was reportedly using as agents José ABRAHANTES Fernández
of the 26th of July Movement and Ylilio Jaime FIGUERES y Amas, liaison
officer between G-2 and the Ministry cf State and a member of the
Communist Popular Socialist Party (PSP),
December 1960: It was said that he had gained prominence in the
University Students Federation (Federación Estudiantil Universitaria
FEU) through Raul Castro, to whom he had sold out morally and
politically.
February 1961: A report during this month stated that Subject
had made overtures to various Embassies for asylum. This has not been
confirmed.
March 1961: Subject was reportedly arrested attempting to flee
Cuba. His attempted departure was alleged to be a trap with Subject's
witting participation, and it resulted in the arrest of several
anti-Castro individuals.
April 1961: A Cuban civil engineer in the United States said he
had received a message on 11 April frce Dr. Armando de CARDENAS y
Aranguren (who defected to the United States in August 1961) that
Subject wanted to defect but was under close surveillance and needed
an excuse to leave Cuba by legal means. Dr. Cardenas was called
Subject's "bey friend" in common gossip.
August 1961: Subject told an intimate friend prior to departure
for a tour of the USSR, the Soviet Eloc, India, Japan, Italy, Spain
and France that he knew his usefuiness to the regime was over and
that if he remained in Cuba he would be liquidated in the very near
future. He said that he had had serious arguments with Fidel CASTRO
and with Ernesto "Che" GUEVARA de la Serna over his successor as
president of the FEU. Subject wanted to name his own successor ard
not accept their choice of the Communist Ricardo Alarcon, secretary
general of the FEU when Subject was its president. Subject also said
he was too involved with the actions of the Government of Cuba to
become a defector like José PARDO Llada, but hoped to remain in
France at the completion of the above-mentioned tour to take post-
graduate medical work in a school in France.

ATTITUDE TOWARD REGIME: (Cont'd)
In January 1962 a Cuban exile said that Subject had probably
decided not to defect because of fear that he would be put in an
immigration detention camp (see Unit 23, Weaknesses).
April 1962: Fidel CASTRO sent one fnu CUBELA, possibly identical
with Subject, to the interior to criticize local militia for their
attempts to win public support. He stayed at the home of one
Eugenio HERNANDEZ and publicly reprimanded the chief of the Camajuani
militia. Hernández, who is an employee of the Department of Sanitation
in Camajuani, has a son, a classmate of Subject, who is a counter-
revoluticrary. When Eernández told Subject about his son's activities,
Subject did not seem concerned.
1962: The US Army reported that Subject controlled the students
at the University of Havana. His loyalty to the Communist Party was
uncertain. It had been said at tires that he had conspired against
Castro. It had also been said that he spoke against the United States
to please Castro.
1962: He was reportedly involved in plotting the overthro. of
Fidel Castro with other members of the military and government,
specifically, Felipe GUERRA Matos, Comandante Pedro MIRET Prieto,
Capitan Lester RODRIGUEZ Pérez (as of 23 July 1963 director of
ferrous metallurgy, Metallurgical Branch of Consolidated Enterprises
which is subordinate to the Ministry of Industry), Comandante Faustino
PEREZ Hernández, Gustavo ARCOS y Bergnes (Cuban Ambassaior to Belgium
and leader of this group), José María de la AGUILERA y Fernández del
Nogal (who was in June 1963 secretary general of the Cuban Confeder-
ation of Labor), Capitán Juan NJIRY y Sanchez and Comandante Jorge
SERGUERA Riveri.
1962: During summer meetings with his friend Carlos TEPEDINO
Gonzalez (now in exile in the United States) he reportedly said that
he could not go back to his former wife even if he wanted to because
she had been too outspoken in her dislike for the Castro regime. He
also mentioned her desire to leave Cuba. This comment was based on
the supposition that Subject might be working against the Castro
regime in Cuba on his return to that country.

FEU, and Subject, a former studert leader, had resigned from the rebel
army after difficulties with Raúl CASTRO. The difficulties occurred.
after Subject and QUEVEDO hai completed a senior army training course
and, instead of receiving the rank of comandante which they had held
during the revolution, were told by Raúl Castro that they were being
demoted to capitán. Both then resigned.

REGIME'S ATTITUDE TOWARD SUBJECT:
1959: Subject was recognized as a leader of the Revolutionary
Directorate (Directorio Revolucionario DR) group that fought in the
Sierra del Escambray.
March 1959: On 25 March the Gaceta Oficial announced that
Subject had been promoted from comandante in the rebel army to
comandante in the revolutionary army and that he had been appointed
to the post of Cuban military attache to Spain by Fidel CASTRO. He
left on or about 27 March to take up this position. It was reported
that there had been some friction between the members of the DR and
members of the 26th of July Movement. Members of the DR felt that
Fidel Castro and the 26th of July were not giving the DR enough
recognition for their work in the combat against Batista. There was
also som thought that this appointment of Subject to Spain was the
beginning of an attempt on the part of the Castros to separate the DR
leaders, Subject had been second in command of the DR.
June 1959: An ex-DR leader was reported holding a position in
the Cuban Government. On Subject's return from Spain he had been
appointed to a position of Under Secretary in the Ministry of the
Interior.
September 1959: Armando HART Davalos proposed to Fidel Castro
that the Ministry of Education appoint a commissioner to supervise
university activities. Castro said no on the grounds that it would
be offensive to the students, that it would show direct government
intervention, and that the university had historically been autonomous.
As long as this continued the revolutionary authorities could not carry
out a university reform program. A practical approach was found when
the DR nominated Subject as a candidate for the presidency of the
University Student Federation (Federación Estudiantil Universitaria
FEU). Castro and other revolutionary leaders saw Subject as a
candidate who could be influenced and won over to the 26th of July
Movement. Castro showed no open indication that he supported either
Subject of the 26th of July's candidate, Pedro Luis BOTTEL; however,
it was said that he had made a private deal with Subject to win con-
trol over the student body. US officials commented that this deal
seemed unlikely since Subject had previously told intimates he
would kill Castro if he, Subject, did not get out of Cuba soon. He
said that he was disgusted with the regime. Another source gave the
same account but said that it was Raúl Castro rather than Fidel who
approached Subject. Subject resigned from his post as Under Secretary
in the Interior Ministry to become a candidate for FEU president and
was elected on 17 October 1959.

REGIME'S ATTTTTUOR TOWARD SUBJECT:
December 1959: Subject and Raúl CASTRO were reportedly
surprised in the latter's home in the Camp Colombia headquarters
making obvious homosexual advances toward one another. Subject later
fell into disgrace with regime. It is not known whether this was due
to his unsatisfactory performance as a student leader or whether he
hai a falling out with Raul Castro. It was supposedly common
knowledge that Subject had obtained the FEU presidency through Raúl
Castro to whom he had sold out morally and politically. It was also
said that he was picked for the FEU post because Fidel thought he
could be controlled.
May 1960: As president of the FEU, Subject received the task
(from the government) of inciting and bruiting about the fact that
the powers-that-be disapproved of Aureliano SANCHEZ Arango. The
latter and a thousand-odd well-wishers who had gathered at the air-
port to greet him on his return from Caracas were set upon by a small
but well-organized pro-Communist phalanx. The government also used
Subject and Angel QUEVEDO Valdivia, then secretary general of the FEU,
to attack (Manuel) Antonio de VARONA y Loredo, Aureliano Sánchez
Arango and (Rafael) Mario LLERENA Rodriguez for their participation
in the Second Congress for Liberty and Democracy which was held in
Caracas in early May. Subject and Quevedo issued a statement to the
effect that Varona, Sanchez and Llerena did not represent any element
in Cuba. This was a significant comment because (although it had been
known that the three had tacitly opposed the revolutionary government's
extremist trend) this was the first strong stand the three leaders
made against the regime.
May 1960: Subject denounced the (US?) Embassy "aviso"
(unidentified) as irrefutable proof of US plans to commit eggression
against Cuba. All government-aligned elements in the following days
pointedly expressed their support for the FEU and the "thousand-times
glorious" Comandante Cubela (Subject), its president.
August 1960: Contacts among student circles in Havana stated
that Subject was likely to be removed from the presidency of the FEU
because he had shown reluctance to adhere to Communist orders. It was
thought that he might be charged (presumably as an excuse to discharge
him) with using 1,000 pesos given to the FEU for the election of Miss
Universe, for personal entertainment of friends in Varaderc, Cuba.

REGIME'S ATTITUDE TOWARD SUBJECT:
December 1960: The government-controlled newspaper El Mundo
announced that Subject had been named president of the newly
established Revolutionary Vigilante Committee in the University of
Havana. Similar committees were to be established throughout the
country, US officials called Subject Fidel CASTRO's "sharpshooter
in the University of Havana,"
March 1961: Subject was reportedly arrested in an attempt to
flee Cuba but this was alleged to be a trap with Subject's
participation. It resulted in the arrest of several anti-Castroites.
August 1961: Subject told an intimate friend prior to departure
for a tour of the USSR, Europe and other countries, that he knew his
usefulness to the regime was over and that if he remained in Cuba
he would be liquidated in the very near future. He reportedly said
he had had serious arguments with Fidel Castro and Ernesto "Che"
GUEVARA de la Serna over his successor as president of the FEU. He
wanted to name his own successor and not accept their choice of
Communist Ricardo ALARCON, secretary general of the FEU while
Subject was president.
March 1962: Fidel Castro reportedly called in Subject and
other army commanders (José María de la AGUILERA, Felipe GUERRA Matos,
Juan NUIRY y Sanchez, Jorge SERCUERA Riveri and Pedro MIRET Prietc) to
tell them that the Communists were trying to take over the Government
of Cuba. He asked the group to back him up and they agreed. Never-
theless, the source of this report stated that these leaders were
thought to be planning to assassinate Fidel and Raúl Castro and "Che"
Guevara and take over the government for themselves. They thought
this plan would succeed because they were in charge of regular army
and militia troops. The source attributed the sabotage that was
then current in Havana to the work of this group.
April 1962: Fidel Castro sent ore fnu CUBELA, possibly identical
with Subject, to the interior to criticize the local militia for their
attempts to win public support. He stayed at the home of one Eugenio

June 1962: An official Spanish service reported that one Captain

said that Subject was in charge of a tank unit composed of students
in the University of Havana. This unit was located in the block
between Calles 23 and 25 and J and L. (As early as January 1962 a
high-level Cuban Minister in exile in the United States had reported
that Subject was in charge of the University of Havana defenses to
make the university a major center of resistance to any anti-govern-
ment attack.
Early March 1963: A Cuban Government employee with good contacts
in military services reported on 25 April 1963 that Subject had been
recalled into active service from his post as a doctor in the
Municipal Children's Hospital.
Late 1963: Subject reportedly resigned from the rebel army
after difficulties with Raul Castre. The difficulties occurred
after Subject had completed an army training course and instead of
receiving the rank of comandante which he had held during the
revulution he was told by Raúl Castro that he was being demoted to
capitan. (See Unit 4, Attitude toward Regime.)
