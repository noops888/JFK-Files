Mr. Klein. You told us that after the assassination

.17
you had an opportunity to be present when Oswald's file was
18
brought from Minsk, is that right?
19
Mr. Nosenko. Absolutely right.
20
Mr. Klein. Did you have an opportunity to read the entire
21
file at that time?
22
Mr. Nosenko. No, sir.
23.
Mr. Klein. How much of the file did you read?
24

Mr. Nosenko. It was simply looking, page by page, first
part of the first volume.

Mr. Nosenko. Yes, sir.

Mr. Klein. Did you go through any of the other volumes?
5
Mr. Nosenko. No, sir.
6
Mr. Klein. You told us that an officer named Matveev
7
took the file away to prepare a summary?
8
Mr. Nosenko.
Right.
9
Mr. Klein. Do you know who wrote that summary?
10
Mr. Nosenko. The summary was written by the First
11
Department of the Second Chief Directorate.
12
Mr. Klein. Do you know who, in particular?
13
Mr. Nosenko. No, sir, I do not know.
14
Mr. Klein. And did you ever have an opportunity to read
15
the summary that the First Department prepared?
16
Mr. Nosenko. No, sir; I didn't see it.
17
Mr. Klein. The Russian word "spravka", does that mean
13
Mr. Nosenko. Is summary, right.
19
Mr. Klein.
And why were you not able to read the summary
20
that they wrote?
21
Mr. Nosenko.
Well, the file was taken in the First
22
Department. I was working in the Seventh Department.
13
Mr. Klein. Did you make any attempt to read it?
24
Mr. Nosenko. No.
25
Mr. Klein. Was it at all unusual that with all your

involvement in the case you did not have an opportunity to

read that file?
2
Mr. Nosenko. It was the decision of the Chief of the

Second Chief Directorate, given big importance to this question,
A
that a resume will be prepared by the most prestigious depart-
5
ment, American Department, and that is why we couldn't even ask.
6
Mr. Klein. You didn't even ask to see it?
7
Mr. Nosenko. No.
8
Mr. Klein. So it was not unusual that you were not

allowed to see it?
10
Mr. Nosenko. No, it was not unusual.

Mr. Klein. You have testified before this Committee that

to Lee Harvey Oswald because he was uninteresting; and that you

Do you know what year Lee Harvey Oswald came to the Soviet

13 Union?
19
Mr. Nosenko. 1959.
20
Mr. Klein. In 1959, approximately how many Americans
21 wanted to defect to the Soviet Union or requested permission to
22 defect?
23
Mr. Nosenko. There was a defectionist, I remember, one
24
of the employees, one of the workers, who was helping to or-
25
ganize the American Exhibition in Moscow, Mr. Webster.

Without giving particular names, how many

What would the number be?

Mr. Nosenko. These two were known to me
Oswald and

Webster.
6
Mr. Klein.
From 1955 to 1960, what would be your best

estimate as to how many Americans asked permission to defect
to the Soviet Union?
Mr. Nosenko. As far as I heard, there I think was one
10
only.
il
Mr. Klein. One other, meaning three altogether.
12
Mr. Nosenko. One besides Oswald and Webster, what I
13
know.
14
Mr. Klein. Three?
15
Mr. Nosenko. T hree.
16
Mr. Klein. Of the three, was Oswald the only one turned
17
down because he was uninteresting?
13
Mr. Nosenko.
Right...
19
Mr. Klein. Do you know any other defector who was ever
20
turned down because he was uninteresting?
21
Mr. Nosenko. No.
22
Allow me to tell, as you have seen, and you told yourselves,
23
24
how many Americans are defected. It is a very rare occasion and
KGB prefers defection when they are planning, they want, these
25
types of defectors, they like and invite those people who can

When Seventh Department was

Chief Directorate, not asking them before, is it person will
11
be for them valuable or not.
Mr. Klein.
12
And that KGB officers were getting bonus
13
and promotions when they induced people to recruit?
14
Mr. Nosenko.
Right.
15
Mr. Klein. And despite that, Lee Harvey Oswald, when
16
17
he asked to defect, you turned him down without even speaking to
him, to find out if he had any information; is that right?
18
Mr. Nosenko. Sir, we had quite a few recruitments in 159,
19
20
a very big amount of them in '59 very interesting, much,
much more interesting
professors and teachers -- and
21
even was a Co-op from CIA we had quite a few recruitments
22
and Oswald was nothing on this base, on this foundation.
13
24
25
Mr. Klein. Would the KGB have any interest in an
American student?
Mr. Nosenko. As I told you yesterday, KGB interested in

students, but particularly those students who are studying
the Russian language, Russian history, Russian economy.

5
Mr. Klein. And would they have any interest in an
American who had strong anti-American views and who was a
professed Marxist? Would they have any interest in that
kind of person?
5

9
10
Mr. Nosenko. Here were are coming to a very interesting
and sensitive question. From mid-1950, by the order of
Central Committee Communist Party, Soviet Union, KGB was
prohibited to make any approachment and recruitment of
members of the Communist Party of the West.
11
Mr. Klein. I am not asking about a member of the
12
Communist Party.
13
Mr. Nosenko.
Your question is, and if he is some type
4
15
of Marxist here, the question maybe he is possibly a member
16
of Communist Party, and to check it for KGB very difficult
17
if he is a member of Communist Party or not of his country.
18
Mr. Klein. Would they ask him if he is a member of
19
the Communist Party?
20
Would they check it?
21
Mr. Nosenko. No, they would not ask him.
22
Mr. Klein. They wouldn't ask him?
13
Mr. Nosenko. No.
24
Mr. Klein. Would the Soviet Union be interested in
25
someone who was in the military and worked with radar equipment?

Mr. Nosenko.
It depends. If he was corporal, private,

Mr. Klein. And in 1959 would the Soviet Union have been
interested in someone who served as a radar operator on an air
base where U-2s took off and landed?
Mr. Nosenko. Yes, sir; it would be very interested.
10

12
who was a student, who was a professed Marxist, who had --

student.
Mr. Klein.

16
who had been a radar operator and had
17
worked on a base from which U-2 airplanes took off and
13
landed, that he wasn't even interesting enough for the KGB
19
to speak to him, to find out if he knew any of this information?

And if you, Mr. Klein, are basing on what was written by

taken ideas. Mr. Epstein even telling that how important

We knew every base and in Japan, at this Atsugi Base, and we
knew what kind of airplanes had been. We didn't know about.
U-2, no. Sure, it is very interesting, but when Oswald
applied, requested to stay in the Soviet Union, we didn't know
a word about his knowledge, anything concerning U-2 flights.
7
8
Mr. Klein. And you didn't ask him if he had any kind of
information about that when he wanted to defect, is that
9
correct?
10
:
Mr. Nosenko. No.
11
Mr. Klein. And you told us that one reason that no one
was working on Oswald was because all of your people were

Mr. Nosenko. I can explain you why, because an American
Exhibition in Moscow was by the information which KGB had,
I don't know how much it's right, how much it's wrong, but it
was suspected quite a number of people from American intelli-

it is not one officer, it is a big amount of people involved

Looking at the newspaper article clipping, on

Mr. Nosenko.
The date is September 4.

Mr. Nosenko. Mr. Klein, I would like you to ask when
Americans who were working for this Exhibition left Moscow..
Mr. Klein. I will ask you another question.
Yesterday, when I asked you if things got back to
:
normal once the fair ended, did you say yes?
Mr. Nosenko. No, till they were leave the Soviet
6
Union. No. They are the same targets. Okay, you are right,

a
9
it is closed September 4th, but does it change the importance
of these people against whom KGB was working? They were
still in Moscow.
10
11
12
13
14
Mr. Klein. Do you recall yesterday my asking you, did
things in your department get back to normale once the fair
ended, and do you recall saying yes?
:
Mr. Nosenko. Well, I meaning fair ended when left all
15
the people involved in work on American Exhibition, Americans
16
when they left, and they were staying quite a long time
17
after it was closed.
18
:
It was closed for visits for Soviet
citizens, but it took quite a time for them to leave.
:
Mr. Klein. You also testified yesterday that Lee Harvey
19
20
21
Oswald was allowed to stay in the Soviet Union after he said
that he was going to kill himself if they sent him home.
22
You told us that he slashed his wrists and two psychiatrists
23
examined him and both found him mentally unstable.
24
Mr. Nosenko.
Right.
23
Mr. Klein. What was the point of having the two
भW 50955 DocId: 32277209 Page 14

13
psychiatrists examine him?
Mr. Nosenko. I think simply to be assured that it was
right found decision, concerning this person. Two independent.
After they examined him, the decision was
3
Mr. Klein.
4
made to let him stay; is that correct?
5
6
7
8
9
Mr. Nosenko. It is not because of the examination
:
he was allowed to stay, Mr. Klein. You are a little bit mixing
things. He was allowed to stay because KGB and Soviet Govern+
ment had come to the conclusion if this person will kill
himself it will bereaction in newspapers, which can in any way
10
11
12.
13
14
hurt the starting, the warming of Soviet-American relations.
Mr. Klein. The Soviets were worried he would kill himself
in the Soviet Union?
Mr. Nosenko. Right, if they would not allow him to
15
stay.
16
Mr. Klein. Could the KGB have taken him and put him on
.17
the next plane out of Russia and thereby ended their whole
18
problem with Lee Harvey Oswald?
19
Mr. Nosenko.
1
It is a very sensitive question. He can
20
21
jump out of car. If he decided, if he is mentally unstable,
you don't know what he will do.
22
Mr. Klein. Do you think the KGB didn't do that because
23
24
they were worried he might jump out of the car or do something
like that?
25
Mr. Nosenko. Simply a mentally unstable person, they
NW 50955 DocId:32277209 Page 15

14
didn't want to go it on any such action.
1
Mr. Klein.
They would rather keep him in the Soviet
2
Union?
3
Mr. Nosenko.
No, they would rather prefer they washed

their hands, Mr. Klein; they are not making decision, KGB.

::
In Soviet Union decisions are made by the Central Committee
of the Communist Party, and General Secretary and Politburo,
7
not by KGB. KGB a servant of the Politburo and Central Commit-
8
tee Communist Party.
Mr. Klein..
Going by the facts as you have told them
10
to this Committee
11
Mr. Nosenko. Yes, sir.
12.
Mr. Klein.
13
why wasn't he put on a plane and sent
back to America?
14
:
!
Mr. Nosenko. KGB washed their hands. Then from Intourist
15
16
it was given information Ministry of Foreign Trade; Ministry
17
of Foreign Trade reported to the Soviet Government. As I said,
18
I assumed the Chairman was surely asked; he told his opinion
19
of the KGB, and up to the Soviet Government how they would
20 decide.
21
Mr. Klein. Could he have been brought to the U.S.
22 Embassy and told them he is an American, "You take care of
23
him; we don't want him"?
Mr. Nosenko. It can be done, sure. It can be done, but
it wasn't done.

15
Mr. Klein. Instead they elected to allow him to stay
1
indefinitely in the Soviet Union and they have to worry about
2
him every single day, what an unstable American would do, is
3
that correct?
4
Mr. Nosenko. They didn't allow, KGB didn't allow. Soviet
5
government allowed.
6
Mr. Klein. The facts as you have testified to them are
7
8
that the KGB allowed this mentally unstable person to stay
in Russia, and they sent him to Minsk to live and work in a
9
10
radio factory. Then the KGB allowed this mentally unstable
individual to carry a Soviet woman, and then this mentally
11
12
unstable individual was allowed to join a hunting club where
13
he had access to a gun.
14
Can you think of any other cases in all the time you
15
worked in the KGB where a mentally unstable person was
16
treated in this kind of manner?
17
Mr. Nosenko.
Excluding one code clerk, American, was
13
of mentally unstable, I told you I do not know any other cases.
19
I never have worked with him, I never have seen him. I heard

also mentally ill he was delivered in Soviet Union. I heard
