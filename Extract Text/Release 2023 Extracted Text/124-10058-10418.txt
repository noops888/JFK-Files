There is enclosed for the Bureau a copy of the s
latest article in the series by THOMAS GITTINGS BUCHANAN, JR.,
which appeared in "L'Express" on 3-26-64.
In this article BUCHANAN discusses the people
"in power" in Dallas and states that they used gangsters
as "front men" in assisting and protecting OSWALD in that
city. Without their concurrence, according to BUCHANAN,
OSWALD would never have been able to have obtained employment
in Dallas. BUCHANAN describes the members of the Dallas
Council as being the wealthy and influential people behind
the scenes in that community and states that seven members
of the Council represent the "cream" of the influential
citizens of Dallas. In the latter group he mentions H. L.
HUNT, his son LAMAR HUNT, as well as CLINTON and JOHN MURCHISON.
Thereafter, BUCHANAN discusses the background and business
dealings of HUNT as well as his relations with General EDWIN
WALKER and the John Birch Society. BUCHANAN also goes into

Xon 3-24-64 JAMES JAMES LESTER LESTER of Of the local office of
CIA advised that his office had received information that
BUCHANAN reportedly is presently employed on an installation
tha
of Bull office machines being used by the Prefecture of
Police in Paris. This information has been furnished to the
Prefecture of Police, and while their inquiry is continuing,
preliminary results would indicate that the report is untrue.
In this connection, a copy of the memorandum captioned
THOMAS GITTINGS BUCHANAN, JR., which sets forth background
information concerning him appearing in Bufiles, and which
was transmitted to the Paris Office by Bulet to Baltimore
3-19-64, was made available to the Prefecture of Police.
It appears that the information contained in the memorandum
would be of interest to the Ambassador, RALPH SMITH of the
local office of U.S.I.SK the Direction de la Surveillance
du Territoire (DST), French_domestic counterespionage service,
Kand Kand the local office of CIA. We are therefore furnishing
Copies of that memorandum to them.
A
As mentioned previously, we will continue to
follow this matter closely and promptly transmit to the
Bureau any pertinent information of interest.
