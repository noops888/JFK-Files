Remarks: Our files on Martin Luther King reveal that
after King's killing that an attempt was made to
ct locate James Etal Ray in various countries
where it was suspected he might have fled. There is
no written request from the FBI to do this but Mr
Ober hada number of conversations with Mr Papich of t
the FBI which are referred to in our files. It would
be reasonable to conclude that our effort to locate
Ray was done in close coordination with the FBI and
probably at the FBI specific request. A check of our
fies after the killing krevealed nothing on Ray
prior to the killing of King.
