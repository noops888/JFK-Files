1. Origory Ye. OCLUB came to Finland as a Vice Consul in 1955. In late December
1956 he was promoted to Second Secretary and Chief of the Consular Section, Soviet
Dabaszy. Fron information given by several sources, we have compiled the follonding
description of GOLUB and some background data.
2. Be was born about 1975 in the environs of either Obasa or Kharkov. Be
proudly asserted that he was a Wrainian, Daring World War II he was a colonel in
the Soviet Army, saw action in Leningrad and Moscow and was wounded six times. He
elated to be a child psychologist. Although be looked like a product of peasant
stock, his conversation implied that he was well-educated and knowledgeable on
diplomatic affairs, Marxism and current events which involve the USSR. Contrarily,
kis knowledge of life outside the USSR was meager. He was married to Nina Fedorovna.
Rather sorrowfully he explained that he and his wife would like to have children but
so far have not been so blessed. His main interest in sports vas skiing. He was very
Jovial, congenial and seemed to enjoy playing host. It has been very obvious that he
always picks up the check when he dines with Westerners even if he is not the host.
J. To one source COLUB stated he had served in Vienna, Warsaw, Budapest,
Pucharest and Sophia; while to another he stated that Helsinki was his first foreign
assiement. It is possible that GMUS meant Helsinki was his "first foreign asσίκη-
mant outside the Soviet Bloo (if he had served in Vienna during the occupation), or
ba could have been deliberately attempting to confuse. He has conversed chly in
Resaian and Finnish, however, be stated that he had attended the Language Institate.
Me suspect that be also knows moes English but may feel reluctant to converes in
Boglish.
4. GOLIB's predecessor was a known RIS officer, probably MB. We suspect that
GCLUB is now the top KiB officer in Helsinki. Although we have no cancrete evidence
for this suspicion, we feel that GOLUB's interest in Westerners generally and in
particularly in his opposite numbers in Western installations in Helsinki is more than
would be called for by his position.
5. DS 2074, shan shown a newspaper photo of GCLUB, stated that GOLUB's thoe was
familier. When D3 2074 was told G's name, Source replied that there was a liet-
tenant colonel with this name in the PCB. Source could not remsaber the directorate
bus thought possibly it might have been a technical section. Souros knew that Lt. Col.
GCLUB was a "fairly high boss. DS 2074 could not recall whether be tied ever seen
Lt. Col. GOLUB to know his so he did not know if the GOLUB in the newsphoto wus
identical with the Lt. Col. 00LUB of the MIB.
6. We would appreciate any further information on CLB which sight substantiate
ear smspicions of his intelligence activities.
7. Yo are trying to identify positively the N. MAXEY. Ve have written to
14
and 15-17 stations for more information on the RUCEY who have been
ssessmed to these areas. FOR YOUR INFORMATION ONLY: The description of the N. MALEXY,
how assigned to Finland, more nearly fits that of Mikalay Gerasimovich MARKET who was
forwrly estgoed as a 153 correspondent to London from 1950 to 195) and as Cultural
Attache to the Soviet Enbasty, Boon from February 1956 to stout May 1957. In both
London and Nonn he was suspected of engaging in intelligence activities. We would
asprostate receiving information on the X. MAXEXY, now in Helsinki, which might help
us to identify him.

1. Origory Ye. O0LUB came to Finland as a Vice Consul in 1955. In late December
1956 ha was promoted to Second Secretary and Chief of the Consular Section, Soviet
Embassy. Froa information given by several sources, we have compiled the following
description of GOLUB and some background data.
2. He was born about 1975 in the envirens of either Casa or Kharkov. He
proudly asserted that he was a Wrainian. During World War II he was a colonel in
the Soviet Army, saw action in Leningrad and Moscow and was wounded six times. He
elained to be a child psychologist. Although he looked like a product of peasant
stock, his conversation implied that he was well-educated and knowledgeable on
diplomatic affairs, Karxisa and current events which involve the USSR. Contrarily,
his knowledge of life outside the USSR was neager. He was married to Nina Fedorovna.
Rather sorrowfully he explained that he and his wife would like to have children but
so far have not been so blessed. His main interest in sports was skiing. He was very
jovial, congenial and seemed to enjoy playing host. It has been very obvious that he
always picks up the sheek when he dines with Westerners even if he is not the host.
3. To one source GOLUB stated he had served in Vienna, Warsaw, Budapest,
Bucharest and Sophia; while to another he stated that Helsinki was his first foreign
assianment. It is possible that GFS meant Falsinki was his "first foreign assign-
mant outside the Soviet Bloc (if he had served in Vienna during the occupation), or
bo could have been deliberately attempting to confuse. He has conversed only in
Russian and Finnish, however, he stated that he had attended the Language Institute.
We suspect that he also knows sose English but may feel reluctant to converes in
English.
4. GOLUB's predecessor was a known RIS officer, probably KUB. We suspect that
GOLUB is now the top IB officer in Helsinki. Although we have no cancrete evidence
for this suspicion, we feel that GOLUB's interest in Westeraars generally and in
particularly in his opposite mumbers in Western installations in Helsinki is more than
would be called for by his position.
5. D3 2074, shan shown a neuspaper photo of GOLUB, stated that GOLUB's race was
familiar. When D3 2074 was told GOLD's nava, Source replied that there was a lien-
tensat colonel with this name in the CB. Source could not remsaber the directorate
bus thought possibly it might have been a technical section, Sourca knew that Lt. Col.
GCLUB was a "fairly high boss. DS 2074 could not recall whether be lizd ever seen
Lt. Col. GOLUB to know him so he did not know if the GOLUB in the newsphoto was
identical with the Lt. Col. OCLUB of the MOB.
6. We would appreciate any further information on OCLUB which might substantiate
ear suspicions of his intelligence activities,

17. We are trying to identify positively the H. MAXKY. We have written to
the Belsinki and London stations for more information on the KUCYETs who have been
asatened to these areas. FOR YOUR INFORMATION OY The description of the R. MARTEV,
how assigned to Finland, more nearly fits that of Mikolay Gerasimovich MAKKEV who was
formerly assigned as a TASS correspondent to London from 1950 to 1953 and as Cultural
Attaebo to the Soviet Enbasty, Boom from February 1956 to about May 1957. In both
London and Bonn he was suspected of engaging in intelligenes sctivities. We would
asprestate receiving information on the N. MAIZKY, now in Helsinki, which might help
us to identify kia.
