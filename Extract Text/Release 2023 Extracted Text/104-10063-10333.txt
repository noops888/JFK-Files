BOTH RODRIGUEZ AND GELABERT IN GENERAL FIT PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
PROVIDED FOR "QUESADA", BUT NEITHER HAS ANY SCARS. BASED ON
ALL HYSAGE-1 INFO ON "QUESADA", RODRIGUEZ SEEMS MORE LIKELY
TO BE IDENTIFIABLE. THIS ASSUMPTION BASED PRIMARILY ON HIS
1964 ACTIVITIES MEXICO. LATEST INFO ON RODRIGUEZ IS THAT HE
TRAVELED TO CHILE 4 JUN 71 FOR UNDP MEETING AS REPRESENTATIVE
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS DIRECTORATE, MINREX. RETURNED CUBA
ABOUT 16 JUN 71.
