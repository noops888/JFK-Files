SOURCE
THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION
Source maintains close contacts with Haitians in the US and with
prominent business and political figures in Haiti and travels
at irregular intervals to the Caribbeen countries.
1. Clemard Joseph Charles vas rearrested at 1600 hours 11 May 68.
His present whereabouts are not known to me.
2. It became clear, during the period between 3 May 68 and 16 May 68
that Charles would not be able to raise the ransom sum of US$605
thousand. His release from prison, which took place on 25 Apr 68,
vas apparently contingent on his ability to produce that sum.
[Collector's Note: See 00-B-321/14068-68.7. Immediately fol-
"lowing his release, Charles attempted to interest foreign
investors in subscribing to a fund of US$605 thousand. This sum
was to be placed in a reorganized Banque Commerciale d'Haiti,
formerly Charles' private preserve, and used to pay off depositors
and to stimulate investment in Haitian enterprises. Charles
soon learned, however, that the present political and particular-
ly the present economic conditions in Haiti were such as to
discourage foreign investors from risking their money there.
Nobody would invest US dollars. Nobody wants gourds. Nobody
is interested in investing in a bankrupt country. Even Charles'
reported willingness to pledge as collateral his extensive hold-
ings in Haiti (essential oils and various other business enter-
prises, land, buildings and Haitian government bonds) failed to
change the negative opinions of those approached as possible
investors.
3. Charles holds a receipt from the Banque Nationale de la Repub-
lique d'Haiti (BNRH) in the amount of US$300 thousand dated
1966, and claims from the BNRH another personal credit of
US$100 thousand, dated 1965. He does not, however, hold copy
of any receipt for the latter sum. Charles apparently cannot
utilize these sums, or his credit for them, to pay off the
US$605 thousand ransom.
4. Charles' current visible cash assets consist of US$100 thousand,
deposited in the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company and the
First National City Bank, both of New York City. He originally
had US$110 thousand in these two banks. When he was first

imprisoned in 1967, the Haitian authorities (no additional data
available) compelled him to sign a mmber of blank checks of
these two banks. The authorities then cashed a check for
US$10 thousand, which the bank honored. When the Haitian
authorities next presented filled-in checks, however, the bank
refused payment, because it knew of his arrest and refused to
believe that he had signed a check after his arrest. The
Baitian authorities then abandoned their attempts to lay their
hands on the rest of the money.
5. It is possible that President Duvalier might settle with Charles
for the US$100 thousand on deposit in New York, when, as and
if he finally realizes that Charles is not able to raise the orig-
inal. US$605 thousand demanded. On the other hand, it is entirely
possible that Charles has other funds secretly deposited outside
of Haiti. It must be recalled that he acted for some time as
courier for President Duvalier, periodically took money for the
President to Switzerland and deposited it there for him. Charles
may therefore have utilized the opportunity to deposit some of
his own money outside of Haiti.
6. If Charles did in fact deposit money of his own in Switzerland
or some other locality outside of Haiti, President Duvalier may
know or suspect that he has done so. He definitely does know
about Charles' US$100 thousand in New York. Accordingly,
Charles' 11 May 68 rearrest may be the preliminary to reneved
pressure to induce Charles to part with his New York money
and/or the funds which he my have secreted elsewhere outside
of miti.
