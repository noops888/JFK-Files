2023 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
RELEASE IN FULL

24 November, 1998
Memo for the Record
Subject: JFK Records Review Lessons Learned
The CIA's JFK Collection is made up primarily of
records pulled together for the Warren Commission, House
Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) and the
Assassinations Records Review Board (ARRB). It contains a
significant amount of duplication and non-JFK related
material. The current index is flawed and contains gaps.
Release standards were liberal; basically only source
identities and information, names of agents, employees under
cover, Agency locations and foreign liaison activities were
redacted. There is no evidence in the Collection to indicate
that the Warren Commission conclusions were wrong.
I. The JFK Act
Mandated review and declassification projects can be
two-edged swords. The JFK Act forced the Agency to review
records that should have been opened years ago. The legal
requirement to presume release, backed up by an independent
review, resulted in the opening of documents that clearly
would not have been released under other programs. However,
the Act and the Review Board created by the Act imposed un-
realistic deadlines, inflexible standards and procedures
which created a major drain on all Agency review resources
and had an over-all negative effect on the Agency's release
program.
Unrealistic Deadlines: The release dates set by the
Act did not take into account the start-up time and costs
(searches, inventorying and indexing) of a project of this
magnitude, nor the time it would then take for a page-by-
page review and sanitization of classified documents. For
example, initial indexing of the collection was done on a
crash basis using overtime employees and resulted in a
flawed database. The revising, re-indexing and updating of
that database took several thousand man-hours and continues
today."
Mandated Procedures: NARA's and ARRB's interpretation
of the law created a time-consuming, labor-intensive review
process that meant an inordinate amount of time was spent by
both the Agency and Board staff on issues which were
marginal to the story and to processing decisions by the
Board. For example:
a. Under the JFK Act every piece of paper in the
collection was considered a "unique" assassination record.
The result is a staggering amount of chaff and duplication.
For example, one cable was files and processed 58 times in
the collection.
b. The ARRB required that all sanitized documents be
reviewed by the Board and that each postponement (deletion)
be acted on individually. Even after the Board changed
procedures and accepted staff recommendations instead of
reviewing each document, the detailed tracking, recording
and coding of every deletion within each document required
processing resources well beyond what would be considered
reasonable for such a project. A most sanitized documents
contained multiple deletions (one contained more than 1600
deletions and many over 100).
Inflexible Standards: The level of evidence required
by the Board to postpone what was generally considered
protectable information was extremely high and usually
required documentation of â€œcurrent harm". Defenses based on
general principles such as official cover or sources and
methods were not acceptable. This required the Agency to
dedicate significant resources to prepare evidence to
support recommended postponements. Again, much time was
spent on issues that were marginal to the JFK story. For
example, several major evidence packages involving several
offices and presentations by senior agency officers and
officials were needed to secure Board agreement to protect
Agency physical locations and names of employees and other
persons not related to the JFK story.
Three times during the six years of the project, including
most of this past year, the JFK review effectively shut down
all other aspects of the Historical Review Program and had
to borrow additional resources from other offices and review
projects to meet deadlines. The JFK review will continue to
require a significant portion of HRP's resources through
FY99.
II. The Process
There are a number of basic lessons from the JFK review
that are applicable to other historical/systematic review
projects:
We need reviewers with broad Agency experience, which
can be either managerial or substantive.
We need to establish early on what information is
already in the public domain and address the issue of
"official release" in the context of each project.
Develop a strategy/policy with the IROs concerning the
release of information. Be smart about it; do not accept
stonewalling by them on relevant information that can be
released. At the same time, avoid confrontations with them
on marginal or non-relevant information.
On-site Directorate reviewers are the most effective
way to handle the internal coordination requirements of a
large project. Without the DO's JFK team on site it would
have been impossible to complete the JFK project.
Develop guidelines and processes for coordinating Third
Agency documents; include other agencies in discussions; do
not drop documents into the black hole of other agencies'
FOIA offices without this advance discussion.
Maintain written, up-to-date, project-specific
declassification guidelines. This is no small task. A
"declassification guide" must be flexible; no guide can
anticipate all the issues which will arise in a review.
After six years, we were still revising the JFK guidelines
in the last month of the project.
In establishing deadlines, allow sufficient time to do
a thorough, professional job as required by the project
activities (see Unrealistic Deadlines above).
Ensure we have adequate support people for routine
processing tasks; declassification involves both tough
substantive analysis--and a lot of routine processing.
If possible, inventory/index all materials before the
review and processing begins. Experienced indexers are a
must. Identification of duplicate documents should be a key
part of any inventory or index.

Assassinations Records Review Board (ARRB). It contains a
significant amount of duplication and non-JFK related

I. Background (1992-1995)
The setting up of the Historical Review Program by DCI
Gates in early 1992 coincided with growing interest in
Congress to require federal agencies to declassify records
related to the assassination of President Kennedy. DCI Gates
decided to start declassification process before Congress
passed legislation:
testified before Congress on 12 May 1992 about CIA`S
new openness policy and announced the declassification
of the first folder of Oswald's 201 (also known as the
pre-assassination file).
six boxes of the Oswald's 201 were reviewed and
transferred to NARA by Oct. 1992.
The John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection
Act of 1992 (JFK Act) was signed 26 October 1992:
it called for Presidential-appointed Assassination
Records Review Board composed of non-government
individuals;
established "a presumption of immediate disclosure"
for records relating to the assassination.
For first two years of its existence, the Historical
Review Program focused primarily on the review of JFK
assassination records:
there were two major releases of Agency records (August
1993 and August 1994) of approximately 227,000 pages;
joint HRG/DO teams reviewed additional assassination
related collections at National Archives (Warren
Commission), the SSCI (Church Committee and the Ford
Presidential Library (Rockefellow Commission) plus
numerous referrals from other federal agencies (FBI,
State, Army, etc.).
Due to delays in the appointment of its members and the
time required to hire and clear a staff, the ARRB did not
actually begin reviewing documents until May 1995. It became
clear in immediately that the ARRB would require the release
of far more information than the Agency had released in the
1992-94 review. In mid-1995 HRG began a re-review of the
previously released sanitized documents:
approximately 80% of the 227, 000 pages release in
1993-94 contained deletions
resources were taken from other projects and added
to JFK project to meet Board's monthly deadlines.
II. The JFK Act and the ARRB
Mandated review and declassification projects can be
two-edged swords. The JFK Act forced the Agency to review
records that should have been opened years ago. The legal
requirement to presume release, backed up by an independent
review, resulted in the opening of documents that clearly
would not have been released under other programs. However,
the Act and the Review Board created by the Act imposed un-
realistic deadlines, inflexible standards and procedures
which created a major drain on all Agency review resources
and had an over-all negative effect on the Agency's release
program.
Unrealistic Deadlines: The release dates set by the
Act did not take into account the start-up time and costs
(searches, inventorying and indexing) of a project of this
magnitude, nor the time it would then take for a page-by-
page review and sanitization of classified documents. For
example, initial indexing of the collection was done on a

flawed database. The revising, re-indexing and updating of
that database took several thousand man-hours and continues
today.

DRAFT:
Section I, ARRB Requests for Additional
Information and Records
1. Unlike most declassification projects, the Agency's
involvement in the JFK Project was governed by the dictates
of a Federal statute, the JFK Act, and the powers it vested
in the Board it established -- the Assassination Records
Review Board (ARRB). In particular, under Section 7, the
Act armed the ARRB with the authority to dig for records and
information, specifically:
...(1) The Review Board shall have the authority
to act in a manner prescribed under this Act, in-
cluding authority to
(C)(ii) direct a Government office to make
available to the Review Board, and if necessary
investigate the facts surrounding, additional
information, records, or testimony from
individuals, which the Review Board has reason
to believe is required to fulfill its functions
and responsibilities;
(F) hold hearings, administer oaths, and subpoena
witnesses and documents.
This substantial authority provided the "ARRB and its staff
with almost unlimited access to Agency records and
personnel. It also was the basis for a number of specific
requests from the Board to the Agency for additional
information, document searches and explanatory papers. HRP
designated this ARRB activity, "Special Requests." During
its existence the ARRB sent to the Agency fifty-three
special requests, CIA 1-16 and CIA-IR 1-37.
2. Categories of Requests:
Although each request had unique characteristics,
all began as a request by the Board or an ARRB staff member
on behalf of the board for information. The requests fell
generally into five broad categories as follows:
a. Requests for access to basic information which
would help the board understand the CIA, its organizational
structure and how it operated around the time of the
assassination which included: Requests for organizational
charts, briefings, mission statements, etc.; review of over
histories of CIA offices and projects; a review of the
so-called "Breckinridge files;" and, a search for an IG
index of Oswald reports.
b. Requests about methodologies which included: How
cable traffic was handled at HQ during the relevant time
period; the existence and use of the inter-agency source
registry; and, the assignment and use of alias's pseudonyms,
crypts, etc.
c. Requests for subject specific matters which
included: The Mexico City Station annual reports; the
existence of DRE monthly reports; Oswald's pre assassination
files; and, a search for any documents or information
detailing the Agency's involvement in transporting and
processing the Zapruder film.
d. Requests for project specific information and
files, which included: Requests for information and files on
AMWORLD, QKENCHANT, an index to the HTLINGUAL materials, and
the Mexico City electronic surveillance tapes.
e. Requests for individual specific information
and files, which included both CIA and CIA associated
individuals and non-CIA individuals: Information on
individuals with JMWORLD; detailed information on Sylvia
Duran; a determination of the identify of a particular
"George Bush;" and, the files on William Pawley.
3. How a Request was Worked Following receipt of a
request and HRP tasking the responsible Agency component(s)
to conduct a search, the materials found were first reviewed
by HRP staff members before access was provided to the ARRB
staff. ARRB staff then reviewed the documents and materials
and identified those which it believed were relevant to
their inquiry and these materials were placed in the normal
queue to be reviewed and processed for release. However,
the mere identification of materials did not equate to
automatic release. Rather, if particularly sensitive
information was involved, negotiations took place and, on
occasion, a written statement about the materials was
provided for release vice the actual document(s).
The Agency's written responses to each request --
either a letter or memoranda -- included, of course, the fact
the materials designated were to be processed for release
according to then current guidelines. The ARRB staff then
wrote its own version of the request, search, and response.
Both of these are a part of the public record on this
project.
Lessons learned: A number of things surfaced as
HRP worked to complete these requests which required
considerable explanation, negotiation, and resolution.
a. First among these was the fact there existed an
outside Board which asked for information and carefully
monitored the responses (a very powerful external Board with
subpoena authority), without doubt caused documents and
information to be found and made available that would not
have been provided to an internal declassification project.
b. Second, for any large project such as JFK to be
successful, there is an absolute requirement that each
directorate and independent office identify two responsible
persons -- a senior management official who can ensure that
deadlines (particularly deadlines established by an external
authority) are met; and, a senior focal point officer, who
has the substantive knowledge and background to both locate
all relevant material and make decisions on its sensitivity.
c. Third, the individuals identified and appointed
in sub-paragraph "b" next above must be fully versed in the
guidelines which pertain to each specific project. They
cannot rely on FOIA or other guidelines as to the depth of
their searches or the conditions governing release/
redaction/denial of materials.

ATTACHMENT #1
CIA'S JFK ASSASSINATION RECORD COLLECTION
Oswald Files
Pre-assassination "201" file --approximately 40 documents that existed at the time of
the assassination. Released in 1992 with minimal deletions.
DO 201 File (Approximately 26,000 pages): Agency's primary file for documents dealing
with the assassination or mentioning Oswald; the file is still active. Contains pre-
assassination documents; materials collected after the assassination and during the
Warren Commission investigation; Mexico City files, Garrison investigation materials
plus other documents related to the assassination or Oswald received over the years. A
microfilm copy of file, as it existed in 1978, was sequestered by the House Select
Committee on Assassination (HSCA).
The DO's original (record copy) 201 was transferred to HRG in early 1992; a
declassified version was released in August 1993; it was re-released with fewer
deletions in 1996 under the authority of the ARRB. Additional documents, filed into the
201 after the its transfer to HRG, were released in September 1998.
Office of Security File (2041 pages): Contained key Oswald documents, FBI
investigative reports, newspaper clippings. This file, primarily duplicative of the 201,
was reviewed by the HSCA, but a copy was not sequestered with the rest of the
Agency's "JFK" collection. The file surfaced as a result of an ARRB request in 1997. A
declassified version of the file was released in 1998.
DCD "A" File (41 pages): A microfilm copy of this Oswald file was in the sequestered
collection. The ARRB requested that the original file by reviewed for release.
Marina Oswald's 201 file. A copy of this file from the sequestered microfilm collection
was reviewed and released in 1994. The ARRB requested that the original file be
reviewed for release by September 1999.
The ARRB directed that the classified originals of all documents from the Oswald files
be transferred to NARA for secure storage. These documents were transferred to
NARA in October 1998.
The Sequestered Collection
At the end of its investigation, the HSCA directed that all materials (files,
documents, memos, notes, tapes, etc.) collected or prepared in response to its
investigation be sequestered. This included files made available for review, but not
reviewed by the HSCA staff.
JFK boxes 1-63 (hardcopy): These boxes are the core of the Agency's JFK collection.
They are the working files/materials of the HSCA staff and reflects the wide range of
issues pursued by the Committee. In addition to Agency documents, they include
approximately 30,000 pages of notes, letters and memos created by the HSCA or its
staff. The boxes are a combination of files on subjects and persons of interest to HSCA
including documents prepared by the Agency as a result of the investigation, eight
boxes of security files and Mexico City cable chrono files. The boxes contain a
significant amount of duplication (most of the Oswald 201 documents appear multiple
times in this part of the collection). A declassified version was released in August 1993,
then re-released under ARRB in 1997.
JFK Microfilm (72 reels): These reels are copies of Agency files that were made
available to HSCA staff. Although the HSCA interest usually focused on a small portion
of a file, the Committee sequestered the complete file. The microfilm includes
approximately 25 reels of 201 files, 6 reels of Office of Personnel files, 14 reels of
Anti/Castro - Cuban exile material, extensive files on Nosenko and operational and
production files from Mexico City. The microfilm also contains copies of all the Oswald
files except for the security file.
DCI Morning Meeting Minutes
This file contain 442 excerpts from the minutes of the DCI's Morning Meetings
that refer to JFK assassination and related issues and investigations. The initial search
for the minutes was in response to an FOIA. The material was turned over to HRG in
1993 for review and inclusion into the Collection.
Russ Holmes' Working Files (19 boxes)
Russ Holmes was a DO officer initially assigned to work on JFK assassination
records in the mid-70s. He was one of the Agency's liaison officers with the HSCA
during its investigation and subsequently became custodian of HSCA sequestered
collection. He continued in this role until 1992.
As the focal point for JFK related requests, Russ Holmes created a JFK
reference file know as the "Ancillary Collection" (13 boxes). The contents are primarily
duplicative (approximately 80%) of material found in Oswald's 201 and in the
sequestered collection, but organized by subjects and requests. The collection contains
some non-related material reflecting Holmes' involvement in other FOIA, etc. requests.
There were an additional six boxes of unorganized reference material and files from his
office transferred to HRG when he retired. These 19 boxes became know as the "Russ
Holmes Working Files" and were declared assassination records as a collection by the
ARRB. Non-duplicative records from this collection were released in September 1998.
The duplicative material is currently being reviewed and will be transferred to NARA in
early January 1999.
LA Division JFK Task Force Files
The survey undertaken in response to Executive Order ##### located seven
boxes of DO Latin American Division continuing JFK Task Force files and related Cuban
material. The ARRB staff reviewed the boxes; the non-duplicative JFK Task Force
documents and selected documents from the Cuban material were designated as
assassination records. 1637 pages from these boxes were transferred to NARA in
October 1998.
New assassination Records -- "M" [Miscellaneous] Series
The ARRB submitted 53 numbered "Requests for Additional Information and
Records" (CIA-# and CIA-IR-# series) plus many informal requests on individuals and
subjects in their search for additional assassination records. Theses requests
generated several 100 additional assassination records including 185 audio tapes from
the Mexico City telephone taps. Additional material related to the JFK Act including DO
cables to the field and working files of the HRP project officer were declared
assassination records in the final actions of the Board. Over 4500 pages and 17 tapes
have been reviewed and prepared for transfer to NARA. The remaining records and
tapes are scheduled for completion by September 1999,.

CIA SPECIAL COLLECTIONS
RELEASE IN FULL
2000
JFK Assassination Records Collection Act
Five year Effort; Estimated 100 person years expended
Extraordinary Authorities/ Access/ "non Precedent Setting Releases"
Processed over 14,000 CIA documents upon which the Board took
direct action.
Transferred to the National Archives over 100,000 redacted pages for
the JFK Collection.
Prepared a Declaration of Compliance with the Act, with a detailed
accounting of CIA actions in response to the Board's requests.
Negotiated a detailed Memorandum of Agreement among CIA, the
JFK Board and the National Archives regarding the disposition and
processing of all documents resulting from the five year review.
"The Review Board considered the CIA's compliance with the JFK
Act....to be one of [the Board's] highest priorities." It is particularly
significant that the board fully accepted the Agency's Declaration of
Compliance and reported favorably on the Agency's activities in
response to the Board.
During FY 1998, compliance with the legal requirements of the JFK Act
absorbed the preponderant portion of HRP resources. HRP completed necessary
coordination with the JFK Assassination Records Review Board on behalf of the
Agency, an ongoing process since FY 1994. HRP provided a central Agency
focus for a process which:
Coordinated with Board Staff on relevancy and classification on roughly
250,000 pages (many duplicates)
Processed over 14,000 CIA documents upon which the Board took direct action.
Transferred to the National Archives over 100,000 redacted pages for the JFK
Collection.
Prepared CIA's Declaration of Compliance with the Act, a detailed accounting
of CIA actions in response to the Boards requests.
Negotiated a detailed Memorandum of Agreement among CIA, the JFK Board
and the National Archives regarding the disposition and processing of all
documents resulting from the five year review.
The Board's report of 30 September 1998 states that "The Review Board
considered the CIA's compliance with the JFK Act....to be one of [the Board's]
highest priorities." It is particularly significant that the board fully accepted the
Agency's Declaration of Compliance and reported favorably on the Agency's
activities in response to the Board.
JFK Act -- Process
Scope/Deadlines/Decisions defined by law and outside Board.
Focal Point (HRP) Serves Primarily as: (1) Moderator
between Board and Components, (2) Bookkeeper, (3)
Consistency Keeper.
Everything reviewed by Focal Point (HRP) and the appropriate
component (Often many times).
Components often take strong initial position but recede in
face of strong arguments.
Senior Agency Managers unaware of intricacies of the Process
unless problems come up.
Exceptions: Issues Taken to Board by senior management:
Cover, Employee Names, Facilities Stations.
Without making a value judgment on the merits of the JFK Act, it is possible to
characterize the process which the Act dictated for CIA.
The scope/deadlines and decisons were defined in the law and by the
Assassination Records Review Board, an outside body. Over the course of the
history of this effort (5 years), CIA, as did other agencies, developed (and
redeveloped) processes and responses to the Board. For the most part the
detailed work by the Staff was at a level which did not involve senior managers
unless a major problem arose.
When problems did arise, Senior Agency officials were asked to make
presentations to the Board and, in all cases, consensus was achieved. No issues
from CIA had to be appealed to the President, the formal procedure in the Act
for resolving differences between Agencies and the Board.
JFK Lessons Learned
Statutory Mandates are Not Efficient
Requirements to declassify All drives out focus on important
Standards for Declassification are Invariably Different
Projects of equal merit without a statute are orphaned
Structure and Planning
Good Communications with Oversight Body
Expertise in Subject matter and Information Management
Strategy, Concepts and Policy known and Understood:
Guidelines (flexible),
Deadlines (reasonable),
Responsibilities
Understanding of Final Product Desired:
Media, Databases, indexes, etc.
Support of Senior Management
Our experience is that statutory mandates such as the JFK Act are very inefficient. The specific
requirements of the act, including Board administrative decisions, required us to :
Address all possibly related documents, no matter how insignificant.
Engage in lengthy negotiation processes over an almost endless number of documents.
Establish databases for management of the documents and workflow
Treat documents in ways different from all other release programs.
Postpone plans for systematic declassification on other programs for which we had no legal mandate.
Our expectation is that there will be more of such mandates, including the recently enacted Nazi
War Crimes Disclosure Act. Similar proposals are under consideration for human rights violations in
central america. What we have learned from our JFK experience is that:
We need to remain in very close coordination with the Oversight body to assure that we are
not going down the wrong street and will have to repeat efforts.
We have found that annuitants "who know the territory" can be extremely valuable as a
resource for finding and understanding the senstitivity of material.
We know that we have to organize within the Agency and to gain agreement early on with
regard to strategies for managing the effort, including agreement on what the final product is to
be and how we are to get there.
We also need to keep senior management attention on what we are doing so that they are not
surprised at the end, which not only causes delays in an orderly process but can lead to
significant misunderstandings between senior participants.
We are trying to apply these lessons learned to our planning for the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure
Act.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Information Review Group, OIM
FROM: Charles A. Briggs
SUBJECT: JFK Declassification Project, OIM
The JFK Declassification Experience
1. My assumption in preparing the attached is that
I was asked because: a) for seven-plus years I've been
involved in the project; and b) my past Agency assign-
ments, including being the first DO Information Review
Officer, gave me the opportunity to see declassification
from many vantage points: from a legalistic directorate-
oriented, either-or standpoint (taking full advantage of
allowed exemptions), to a "corporate" Agency-wide strategy
to foster credibility while protecting secrets that should
remain secret. My comments and conclusions reflect that
experience and do not necessarily reflect the views of HRP
management.
2. Historically, the Deputy Directors have not
paid much attention to information management unless
there's a problem. Then the approach has been: what went
wrong; who's to blame; how can we ensure that this doesn't
happen again; what lessons have we learned? What this JFK
experience reiterates is the need for a proactive, not just
reactive, flexible strategy, with corporate Agency direction
through the Deputies to their Information Review Officers.
And the IROS, who, in essence, determine credibility and
resource impact, should be supergrades, with experience
in at least two directorates. Because information release
has become a major management issue, the Executive Director
is the obvious officer to ensure consistent and informed
implementation of release policy.

3. Considerable skepticism in the public, the media,
and, unfortunately, the Congress results from the in-house
conclusion that denial is justifiable in the absence of
"official acknowledgment" of Executive Branch information,
even though such information is already in the public
domain, from senior Agency officials' publications,
Congressional investigations, books by former Cabinet-level
NSC members, even Presidents. This inflexible legal
strategy may win the battle and lose the war. Lawsuits are
a lot more expensive than negotiation.
4. The Agency Task Force that in 1992 considered
some of the aspects of DCI Gates' "openness" philosophy
did not have the benefit of the JFK experience. I suggest
that a senior-level panel be established to consider an
objective look at the need for continued classification
of generic versus specific sources and methods information,
particularly that already in the public domain and when
dealing with matters of high public or historic interest.
HR 70-14, referring as it does in paragraph e. (4) to
"Guidelines for Declassification" in Executive Order 12356,
does not promote the tactical approach which is suggested
in the Comments section on page eight of the attached.

SUBJECT: THE JFK DECLASSIFICATION EXPERIENCE
1. (AIUO) BACKGROUND: The impact of the JFK
declassification law on Agency resources and information
release decisions was dramatic and to the DO, traumatic. The
resource trauma stemmed from the unanticipated number of years
required to complete the project. In a memorandum for the DCI
dated 11 June 1993, the then-Director of the Center for the
Study of Intelligence outlined a plan for implementing the
"openness philosophy" espoused by both DCIs Gates and Woolsey
through a series of â€œCold War Declassification" projects. He
noted that priority, by virtue of a Congressionally-mandated
deadline of 22 August 1993, had been given to declassification
of the JFK collection; however, he said, â€œwith the end of the
JFK activity in sight," resources could be applied to the
other projects. Six years later (actually seven since the
project got underway), we are almost finished.
2. (AIUO) The substantive, versus administrative,
trauma stemmed from the fact that the JFK Act superseded
all other existing laws, including FOIA, the Privacy Act,
the DCI's authorities
