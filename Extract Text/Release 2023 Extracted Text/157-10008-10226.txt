His January 17, 1975 Memorandum to Colby
His memorandum was written pursuant to a request from DCI
Colby for any information that related to current allegations con-
cerning questionable CIA activities. He had never told anyone other than
Noel and the Cuban pilot about the matter until then.
According to Murray, the atmosphere in Havana was bombastic.
"We were alert to the Cubans' attitude towards us. We knew that the
Cuban Security Service was interested in identifying CIA agents in
Cuba." Among the people, he said, were those both very friendly and
very hostile to the U.S. The opposition to Castro was, at that
time, very disorganized.
The Pilot
The pilot was introduced to Murray by the pilot's cousin.
General assistance to the CIA by the pilot was offered. The Cuban
was aware he had been identified as pro-Castro and anti-U.S. by
Castro forces in Havana and he wanted to let the U.S. know that that
was an inaccurate characterization. So he requested the rendezvous.
He volunteered to help the agency in any way possible and agreed to
accept stringent reporting requirements.
On July 18, 1960, after the contact had been established, the
Cuban pilot contacted Murray and told Murray that he was to pilot a
chartered plane to Prague to pick up Raul Castro Ruz and his official
party. He sought instructions from the agency as to what intelli-
gence task he could perform. Murray immediately cabled Headquarters
for instructions "I sought assistance from headquarters re
additional requirements." The Cuban Branch (WH 4) would have

recieved his request. He asked for instructions re use of the pilot. FILE:
Neither the pilot nor Murray suggested or intimated the possibility
of assassinating Raul Castro. They were thinking in terms of simple
hard intelligence re flight information concerning a denied country.
He noted that Nabiwas aware of Murray's relationship with the pilot
and that all cables were cleared by (No On July 20, 1960 head-
quarters responded with a cable that made Murray "swallow hard" when
he received it. "It left me rather surprised to say the least."
That cable said that headquarters was seriously considering the "remov
al" of Cuba's top three leaders. (A blow-up of that July 21, 1960
cable (98941) shows that all authorizing signatures on the cable are
those of E. H. Hinkle.)

Murray had never heard such proposals or plans or plots dis-
cussed at the Havana station or elsewhere. Indeed, he had not
spoken to Noelor persons above or below (Nockabout such things.
"Not only was I surprised, but I considered the possibility of this
individual (the pilot) executing this type of mission was negligible."
But he didn't question the order when onband-delivered him the
cable. No he said, was equally surprised by the statement in
the cable. This cable represented "quite a departure from the con-
ventional activities we'd been asked to handle." When the cable was
received there was a minimum of time (approximately fifteen minutes)
to tell the pilot of the request for action by Headquarters.
the pilot at a pre-determined spot and spoke to him. He wanted to
avoid the use of words like "kill" and 'assassinate" and so he "talked
in terms of an accident to neutralize this leader's influence." But
the pilot understood the meaning "loud and clear." The Cuban was
serious, thoughtful and then became imaginative in terms of
possibilities. They spoke for 30 to 35 minutes while the pilot
drove to the airport.
He met
When he returned to the station, Murray discovered a cable
from Headquarters, signed by Tracy Barnes which said to "DROP MATTER."
It was, of course, too late to "drop the matter" so all he and
03 Nousould do was hope that the pilot would not be successful in
"accidentally" crashing the plane and killing Raul Castro et al.
The combined reaction of Murray and to this abrupt turn about or flip-
flop on the part of Headquarters on such a sensitive matter was one
of incredulity. "What's going on in headquarters was our reaction."
"It showed inadequate coordination at headquarters prior to release
of the first cable." Moreover, such a turn-about was unprecedented
in his, Murray's, experience. In his opinion, Hinkle would be the best
person to explain the activities surrounding the "removal" cable.
Murray also noted that he had no personal contact with J.C. King on
this matter and said that Nonwould have done any briefing of King on
Cuban matters. He did not know whether Norokhad ever raised the issue
of the reversal of position in the two cables with King or any other
higher official of the agency.
