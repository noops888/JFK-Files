2023 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
SECRET
26 OCT 1959
MEMORANDUM FOR: The Director
Federal Bureau of Investigation
ATTENTION: Mr. Sam J. Papich
SUBJECT: ROBERT EDWARD WEBSTER
Reference is made to the verbal request of Mr. Sam Papich for
advice as to whether this Agency has any interest in Robert Webster
who, according to recent news, has renounced his
United States citizenship and become a Soviet citizen.
A check of Agency records has not revealed that Webster has
ever been used in any capacity by this Agency or ever been given
any type of clearance. Consideration was given in late May
1959 and early June 1959 for a briefing of Webster in regard to
his overseas travel in the Soviet area. However, Webster was not contacted
prior to his departure for the Soviet area.
Recent news or articles relate that Webster was employed by
the and development corporation, Cleveland, Ohio, as a plastics
technician. For your information only, this
Agency does have a limited contractual relationship with the Cleveland
24
corporation in the development of technical
material of interest to this Agency. In view of the indicated employ-
ment of Webster with the Cleveland Corporation it would be
appreciated if your Bureau would furnish this Agency any information
obtained during the course of any investigation of Robert Webster
after his departure.
