BACKGROUND FOR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AMBASSADOR
2.
WE RESEARCHED THE GYVAPOROUS PROMISE TO DELIVER FILES ON
*<LEE HARVEY OSWALD.> WHILE NOT MUCH ON THIS SUBJECT IS REFLECTED IN
THE FILES, WE DID COME UP WITH INFORMATION WHICH INDICATES THAT
THAT MATTER WAS TURNED OVER TO THE FBI FOR ACTION!
OFFER WAS MADE BY JYVAPOROUS/1 (V/1) TO FORMER
OCTOBER 1992,
THE ORIGINAL
IN MAY 92. IN
FOR FOLLOW-UP DISCUSSIONS
CWITH V/1 RE THIS AND OTHER SUBJECTS THE FOLLOWING IS TAKEN
DIRECTLY FROM THE TRIP REPORT:
★
"WE OPENED THE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE TOPIC OF THE LEE HARVEY>
*<OSWALD>FILES; TELLING THE FBI IS PREPARING A LETTER TO PRIME
MINISTER KEBICH, ASKING PERMISSION TO SEE THE FILE. /1 BECAME
CIRRITABLE_AND DEFENSIVE, SAYING THAT SINCE THE USG DID NOT DEIGN
TO MAKE PUBLIC ALL MATERIAL PERTAINING TO ITS OWN INVESTIGATION OF
*THE<KENNEDY ASSASSINATION>(THE WARREN REPORT), WHY SHOULD НЕ ВЕ
PRESSURED INTO SURRENDERING HIS FILE. WE SAID NO PRESSURE IS
INVOLVED WE ARE ONLY FOLLOWING UP ON HIS OFFER. (STILL DEFENSIVE
HE STATED HE WOULD NOT ALLOW ACCESS TO THE RAW FILE, WHICH WOULD
EXPOSE SOURCES AND METHODS USED TO SURVEIL AND INVESTIGATE OSWALD
IN MINSK HE OFFERED INSTEAD SUMMARIES CONTAINING THE RESULTS OF
THE INVESTIGATION AND SURVEILLANCE, WHICH OSTENSIBLY WERE PREPARED
AT THE TIME OF OSWALD'S STAY IN MINSK
"EXPERTS" (PRESUMABLY USG) TO EXAMINE THE DOCUMENTS CLOSELY AND TO
HE HINTED THAT WE
CONFIRM THEIR AUTHENTICITY AND COMPLETENESS.
(NWBOLTAN REPRESENTATIVES) MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO LOOK A BIT INTO THE
RAW FILE. WE_SAID WE WOULD RELAY THIS TO OUR SUPERIORS, BUT
EXPLAINED AGAIN THAT, DUE TO THE SENSITIVITY AMONG SOME AMERICANS
*STEMMING FROM THEIR DISTRUST OF NWBOLTAN VIS A VIS THE<KENNEDY>
HE WOULD ALLOW OUR

<ASSASSINATION, WE COULD NOT UNILATERALLY HANDLE THE FILES
THOUGH WE COULD HELP FACILITATE THEIR PASSAGE TO THE PROPER USG
AUTHORITIES (THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT)
11
V/1 THEN TOLD OUR C/O THAT THE FBI'S LETTER SHOULD BE
SENT TO THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SUPREME SOVIET VICE THE PRIME MINISTER
AND WE AGREED TO SO INFORM THE FBI. THAT MEMO IS THE LAST
INFORMATION WE HAVE ON THE MATTER. THERE IS NOTHING TO INDICATE
THAT THE FBI DID INDEED SEND THE LETTER OR, IF IT WAS SENT, THAT
THEY RECEIVED A REPLY TO IT. BECAUSE IT WAS PREVIOUSLY DETERMINED
THAT THE FBI HAD PRIMACY IN THIS MATTER, IT IS OUR DETERMINATION
THAT WE SHOULD NOT REQUERY JYVAPOROUS. WE HAVE ASKED OUR REP AT
THE FBI TO CHECK (INFORMALLY) AS TO THE STATUS OF THEIR DIALOGUE
WITH THE JYVAPOROUS AND WILL LET YOU KNOW AS SOON AS WE RECEIVE
THE ANSWER. PLEASE ASSURE THE AMBASSADOR THAT HE WOULD LIKE US TO
PURSUE THIS MATTER WITH THE FBI THROUGH OUR CHANNELS, WE WILL BE
GLAD TO DO SO. REGARDS.
