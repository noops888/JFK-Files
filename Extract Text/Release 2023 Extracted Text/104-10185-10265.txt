Memorandum for the Record
Subject: LITAM IL-9.

•
On the night of 7 Nov 62, LITAXL-9 called
and a mig was held at 220v at the corner of Melchor Ocampo and
Gutenberg. NO SECURITY PROBLEMS NOTED.
X
:
L-9 repored as follows:
1. L-9 had just left the Soviet Embassy celebration of the Anniv-
eraary of the Bolchevik Revolution. L-y attended the affair with
X
AXBLANCO
Eusebio AZCUE Lopez, AZCUE's wife, Ana Maria BLANCO T.,/Maricarzen
X
X OLABARRL.
Other Cubans who attended were: Ramon SINOPAS C.و
X
Andres ARMONA Ramon, Teresa PROENZA Proenza. L-9 said that he
immediately noted a cool atmosphere as faras the Cubans were con-
cerned. He said that compared with previous affairs as the Sov
Embassy this cool attitude on the part of the Soviets, in his
opinion, was very noticeable. Le cited XXXXX Yuri ALEXANDROV, who
is usually very friendly with him as an example of the XaXXXXX
change in attitude. L-9 said that ALEXANDROV merely said good
evening to him. L-y said that this attitude might have been dur
to the art fact that there was no Cuban Ambassador but at any rate
emphasized the fact that in his opinion there was a de-
X
cided change in attitude. L-9 pointed outthat Oleg KECHIPORENIKΩ
was the exception to the rule. NECHIPORENKO was very friendly with
Eusebio AZCUE Lopez, Cuban Consul, and they had a long talk. 1-3
said that Vaclav KUBATA approabhed him and introduced him to the
new Czech Amo. After greeting the Amb, KUPATA took L-y aside and
asked him what he thought of the Cupan situation. L-9 tola KUBATA
that it was difficult to get a clear picture because the people
arriving from Cuba all have different opinións, each one in accord-
ance with the way he is thinking (politically). KUBATA tola Ly
つつつつう
14-00000
that he was pessimistic about the situation because in his opinion, the
United States "sigue mantado a caballo" (1.e. continue to be agressive).
L-9 believes that KUBATA is well informed and intelligent, in fact, iy
respects KUBATA's opinion highly. L-9 also mentioned that the Amb from
India avodded him last night and he usually greets him. L-y talked with
MONTES y Bradley at the affair and MONTES complained to him about the wai
way he is being treated at the Cuban Embassy. When L-y left, MONTES was
talking with Ramon SINOBAS.
2. On the afternoon XXXXXXXXXX 7 Nov 82, SINOBAS gave L-9 a note with
a request to ascertain the political position of Mexico re"International
waters and air space". On 7 Nov 62, L-9 went to the Marina and to Comin
caciones, where he received pamplets, flysheets etc re Mexican legiclation
etc. L-9 took this material to SINOBAS but SINOBAS complained saying that
Cuban Cov't it interested in that type of material, what they want to know
is what is Mexico's political position in regard to the jurisdiccion of Σκλ
waters and air space. L-9 tola SINOBAS that this type of ting was not
on paper. He said that the men at the Marina told him that the position of
Mexico can be found in the discourses of Pres. LOPEZ Mateos and ZENO.
L-9 reported that Angel MARTINEZ Ovando's visa arrived and that SAR
TINEZ is anxious to leave for Cuba. MARTINEZ 18 scheduled to be at the
Cuban Embassy on the morning of 8 Κον 62.

4.
1-9 haa lunch with Eusebio AZCBB and Fulgencio Ruz Foret on 7 Nov 62
AZCUE said that there was a great deal of activity at the Kirill icreen
Office because the Mexican Gov't is working out some program wherein they
wil mediate between the ০.১. and Cuba. L-9 said that AZCUs also mentionea
that CASTELLS had painted one of the pictures that he has at his house.
(COMMENT: I believe that AZCUE very much aware Cuban intel net composea
Roberto ROMERO Adams, CASTELLS, XKEMAX Manued (possibly Manuel SOUSA H.)
and possible CRUZ Bonet)
LITAN IL-9

At lunch AZCUE also mentioned that Cuban ov't will probably send
a charge rather than an "mbassador to Mexico. AZCUE tola And LECKUSA
before he left for Havana that he would like LECHUGA to "recruit" h=
and tale him with him to next post, 1.e. New York. AZUUE said he would
also like to go to Japan.
5. L-9 said that BALBUENA, fnu (previously mentioned in L-9 mezo)
was at the Sov Emb last night and that AZCUE drove him home, along
with Ana Maria BLANCO, OLABARRI etc.
6.
