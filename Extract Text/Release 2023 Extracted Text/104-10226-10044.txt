WH/4/CI
: Robert M. GEDDES and the Unidad Revolucionaria
: WAVE 6678 (IN 3091), 12 June 1961
1. Attached for your information is a thermo of the briefing of
Mr. Maurice OLDFIELD, M-6 by Clark SIMONS, C/WH/4/CI on some of the
aspects of the GEDDES Case. This sets forth the background and arrest
of GEDDES, as well as a carenology of the events leading up to it.
2. It is the opinion of this Desk that a portion of the UR has
been blown by the events in this case, but it cannot be determined to
what extent. In reference to this, we list below some of the individ-
uals with whom GEDDES has had contact, and who have been either
arrested, or possibly exposed. It is also believed that some of them
may be under G-2 control.
a.
Antonio CEELLAR - (probably identical with Pedro CUELLAR
Alonso, feruer G-2 agent) - H/T operator for UR.
b. Hector FESLES Barreto - WAVE contact
c.
Ralph DIAZ Escom - ANGLED/1 - arrested 18 March
d. Humberto SORI Marin - arrested 18 March

h. Capt. Aciviliates BERMUDEZ ("Peralta") - traitor to UR
1. Capt. CASTRO Ocevarra - leader of Navy defection plot
J.: (om) SUARTS Lowa - UR - arrested and betrayed associates
k. Henry SANS - UR - arrested; released; asylee in Swiss Embassy

m. Arturo VILLAR ("Navier") - long-time friend of GEDDES;
asylee in Venesuelan Embassy
n. "Jorge" - replaced ANGLAD/1 in UR
o. Dr. (fnu) GALAN - married to a Canadian
p. Bonifacio HERRERA - UR rep in Miami
q. Georgina CHIRINO - UR rep in Havana
3. After the abortive payment of $6,000 on 7 June, a Mre. TORRES
and her daughter, Chirino (possibly identical with Georgina CHIRINO)
appeared at the British Embassy and reported that GEDDES, Villaneuva
(wife of the Manager of the Pepsi Cola Bottling Plant) who had made
several calls to Mrs. GEDDES re "purchase of the house for 6,000",
"Elena" and (mi) GONZALEZ, and "everyone" vero arrested on the
evening of 6 June.
4. It is the opinion of this Desk, that before any commitments
are made regarding the support of the UR, a more detailed plan of
their proposed activities together with a list of individuals they
intend to use be submitted. An attempt can then be made to determine
whether any of the proposed assets are under suspicion or control.
We do not know at this stage of the game whether, or how much,
GEDDES has talked, but every precaution should be taken to avoid
picking up an already-blown group.
