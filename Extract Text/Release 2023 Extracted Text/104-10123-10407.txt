Jr., Alan F. Petit, and William M. Marcy, of the Technical Division,
Office of Security, spent many off-duty hours in experimentation with
various items of equipment in an effort to improve and strengthen the
Agency's Audio-C termeasures Program.24 They conceived and developed
a unique techr

intelligence community and the Technical Security Countermeasures

technique. Through their further efforts in package design they
contributed significantly to the future clandestine use of this
technique on a world-wide basis. This technique provides the
Agency for the first time a procedure through which large in-
terior wall surfaces, room furnishings, and objects can be
rapidly scanned in "real time" in the search for hostile tech-
nical penetrations. This capability will significantly enhance
the security of all Agency installations.
