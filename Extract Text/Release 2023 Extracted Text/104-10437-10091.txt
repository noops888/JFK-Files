2. The LIEMBRACES have surveilled quite often, and only one
unusual contact was noted That was a three hour luncheon with an
<Argentine leftist, Maximo SIMPSON Grinberg, a foreign correspondent
in Mexico for the magazine Medico Moderno. Generally speaking,

than with another Embassy employee, which is more often the rule with
the other officers.
