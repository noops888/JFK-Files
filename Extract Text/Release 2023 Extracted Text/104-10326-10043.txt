DEMARCHE TO USG REGARDING US LEGISLATION ON
*
1. ACTION REQUIRED: PLEASE FAX BY COB 2 OCTA COPY OF THE
DEMARCHE TO THE USG REGARDING LEGISLATION ON THE
DECLASSIFICATION OF DOCUMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE WOULD APPRECIATE
RECOLLECTION OF
REACTION TO THE US LEGISLATION
AS WELL.)
2: THE<JOHN>F.<KENNEDY>REVIEW BOARD<(JFK>BOARD) ESTABLISHED
*BY THE PRESIDENT TO DECLASSIFY ALL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE<JOHN>
*F.<KENNEDY ASSASSINATION>HAS COME ACROSS TWO
DOCUMENTS
(AND FOUR CIA DOCUMENTS)WHICH THEY WOULD LIKE TO DECLASSIFY WHICH
REVEAL THE EXISTENCE OF AN AGENCY
RELATIONSHIP
THE REVIEW BOARD HAS BROAD AUTHORITY TO DECLASSIFY DOCUMENTS
*RELATED TO THE<JFK>COLLECTION REGARDLESS OF THEIR COUNTRY OF
ORIGIN OR THE SENSITIVITY OF THE SUBSTANCE. IT HAS COME TO OUR
ATTENTION THAT THE BOARD HAS REVIEWED THE TWO
AND THE FOUR CIA DOCUMENTS AND DEEMED THEM APPROPRIATE FOR
RELEASE. GIVEN THE OBVIOUS SENSITIVITY OF OUR
RELATIONSHIP
DOCUMENTS
*
OGC IN COORDINATION WITH EA/LGL AND
EA/PAMSI, IS PREPARING A MEMO TO THE BOARD REQUESTING THEY NOT
RELEASE THE FIRST TWO DOCUMENTS BECAUSE THE DOCUMENTS ARE THE
PROPERTY OF
GOVERNMENT. INSTEAD WE ARE WILLING TO
PROVIDE SUMMARIES OF THESE DOCUMENTS OMITTING ANY MENTION OF THEIR
OUR
REFERENCES
ORIGIN OR OF THE EXISTENCE OF A RELATIONSHIP
THE AGENCY DOCUMENTS WHICH MAKE REFERENCE TO
RELATIONSHIP WOULD BE REDACTED TO TAKE OUT ALL
3. IN OUR EFFORT TO PRESENT A SOLID CASE TO THE<JFK>BOARD,
THE MEMO INCLUDES A STRONG ARGUMENT THAT EVEN APPROACHING THE
ON THE ISSUE OF DECLASSIFICATION OF A
DOCUMENT WILL STRAIN OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM. OUR ARGUMENT
SECRET
13-00000
MHFNO: 96-5536596
SECRET
SENSIND
*
WILL ENUMERATE THE THE UNFAVORABLE REACTION THE
HAD TO RECENT DISCLOSURES AND AGENCY REQUESTS FOR PERMISSION TO
DISCLOSE INFORMATION PASSED TO US
EXAMPLES WE INTEND TO CITE INCLUDE THE DUTY TO WARN ISSUE WHERE
WERE ADAMANT ABOUT NOT GIVING PERMISSION TO
DISCLOSE THEIR INFORMATION BECAUSE OF SOURCE PROTECTION ISSUES,
ABOUT THE BOOK PUBLISHED BY A FORMER AGENCY
EMPLOYEE THAT ALLUDES TO
THE RECENT (DEMARCHE EXPRESSING CONCERN THAT A FORMER
AGENCY OFFICER ALLEGEDLY DISCLOSED CLASSIFIED
INFORMATION (AN ALLEGATION THE DDCI ASSURED
BE THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED), AND THE DEMARCHE
RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT OUR U.S.
WOULD
DECLASSIFICATION LEGISLATION AND WHETHER THE LEGISLATION PROVIDES
ADEQUATE GUARANTEES ABOUT NOT DISCLOSING INFORMATION PASSED TO US
APPROACH
WITHOUT EXPRESS AUTHORIZATION. FROM SUCH
WE WILL ALSO MAKE REFERENCE TO A RECENT
ASKING FOR OUR OKAY IN THEIR
DECLASSIFYING SOME OF OUR DOCUMENTS, AND OUR STRONGLY-WORDED
RESPONSE DENYING PERMISSION AND ARGUING THAT SUCH DISCLOSURE WOULD
BE A BREACH OF TRUST.
4. IN ORDER TO BOLSTER OUR POSITION WITH THE<JFK>BOARD,
REQUEST STATION OBTAIN A HARD COPY OF THE
DEMARCHE ON
THE DECLASSIFICATION LEGISLATION THAT CAN BE ATTACHED TO THE MEMO.
WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH HARD COPY EVIDENCE
WILL
BOLSTER OUR ARGUMENT SIGNIFICANTLY. WE ARE UNABLE TO LOCATE THE
ACTUAL TEXT OF THIS DEMARCHE IN HOS..
5. THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS THAT WE DO NOT WANT EVEN TO
APPROACH
ABOUT DECLASSIFYING THE AFOREMENTIONED
DOCUMENTS. WE HOPE OUR MEMO CONVINCES THE BOARD THAT, IN LIEU OF
RELEASING THE DOCUMENTS, SUMMARIES THAT OMIT ALL REFERENCE
6.
WILL SUFFICE.
FYI: OUR FALLBACK POSITION IF THE BOARD TURNS DOWN THE
CONCEPT OF SUMMARIES, IS TO MAKE CLEAR THAT WE CANNOT RELEASE THE
DOCUMENT, EVEN IN REDACTED FORM, WITHOUT
PERMISSION; FURTHER, THAT IF WE SEEK AND ARE DENIED PERMISSION AND
THE BOARD NONETHELESS PROCEEDS WITH THE DECLASSIFICATION, IT WILL
HAVE A TREMENDOUS NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE
IN SUM, OUR GOING-IN POSITION IS WE WANT TO
AVOID RAISING THE SPECTER
THAT THE AGENCY MAY
HAVE TROUBLE PROTECTING THEIR SECRETS. IF THE BOARD TURNS DOWN
OUR INITIAL PROPOSAL AND INSISTS WE SEEK
PERMISSION TO
DECLASSIFY, WE WILL DO SO. IN SUCH AN EVENT. OUR LEGAL PEOPLE
BELIEVE A STRONGLY-WORDED DOCUMENT FROM THE
REFUSING
DERMISSION WOULD PROBABLY PERSUADE THE BOARD NOT TO RELEASE THE
DOCUMENT. WE WILL KEEP YOU ADVISED ON HOW THIS IS
PROGRESSING AND WOULD APPRECIATE ANY FURTHER GRIST FOR THE MILL AS
WE CRAFT OUR MEMO TO THE BOARD AS WELL AS THE TEXT OF THE
DEMARCHE ON DECLASSIFICATION LEGISLATION.
