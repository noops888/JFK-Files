EVENTS LEADING TO RECRUITMENT
Charles W. Wiley first came to the official atten-
tion of the Office of Security (OS) on 9 September 1955,
when Carl F. Heney (Executive Officer, OS) forwarded a
letter written by Wiley to Ermal Geiss (Chief, Personnel
Security Division, OS), who in turn directed the letter
to James W. McCord [Security Research Staff of the Office
of Security (SRS)]. How Heney obtained the Wiley letter
is unknown, inasmuch as the name of the addressee was
deleted in the letter. However, the letter was recorded
in the Executive Registry under number 6-9881. The Wiley
letter is dated 27 April 1955, gives Wiley's address and
telephone number, and Wiley advised that he was working
on an index of the Daily Worker for the years 1933-1945
"and thought that perhaps you might be interested in
specific information that I am likely to find."
On 10 September 1955, James W. McCord contacted Wiley
in Flushing, New York. At that time, Wiley explained the
nature of the index of the Daily Worker for the year
1034-
1945, by stating that he was preparing the index under a
grant from the American Legion Americanism Committee,
headed Lee Pennington (a former employee of the FBI).
Wiley started the index in November 1954. Wiley stated
The contacted the major government agencies in Washington
to ascertain what information in the Daily Worker would
be of most interest to them, and in addition, contacted
a couple of Congressional Committees which McCord surmised
were the House Committee on Un-American Activities and the
Senate Internal Security Committee. Wiley estimated it
would take two and a half years to complete the index.
that time, Wiley was receiving part-time clerical assis-
tance from the Women's Auxiliary of the American Legion
Post in Flushing, New York. Wiley also indicated an in-
terest in Agency employment after finishing the index.
At
The results of McCord's interview with Wiley were
brought to the attention of Robert Bannerman, Deputy Direc-
tor of Security, by 21 November 1955, when Bannerman opined
that "this may be valuable."

McCord met next with Wiley in Washington, D. C., for
two days, ending on 1 December 1955.
By that time, Wiley
had indexed 150,000 names of the Daily Worker covering
January 1934 through June 1936. Wiley stated that the
FBI in New York City and the American Legion were already
making "extensive use" of the index cards. Wiley stated
that one of his purposes being in Washington was to secure
financing for the index continuation.
He stated that his
$5000 a year grant from the American Legion Americanism
Committee would expire at the end of December 1955, and
if negotiations with that body were unsuccessful, he would
attempt to secure financing from the Senate and House Inves-
tigating Committees. Wiley stated that the FBI has indi-
cated the strongest desire that he continue the indexing
but that in his discussion with Mr. DeLoach (Cartha DeLoach,
an FBI senior official), no indication of forthcoming finan-
cial support from the Bureau for this work was indicated.
SEP 1975

In recording this contact with Wiley, McCord opined:
"I think it is obvious that the index
which Wiley is working on would be of con-
siderable value to the Security Ottice and
to CIA, particularly since the Communist
Party membership and activities during the
1934-40 period were for the most part very
open and extensively advertised in the Daily
Worker. An example of how open their activi-
ties were is indicated in the fact that
Elizabeth Bentley's name was mentioned in
a 1935 issue of the Daily Worker at a time
prior to her going underground and acquiring
a RIS (Russian Intelligence Service) mission.
If the Daily Worker thus bears a record of
(Communist) Party activities of an indi-
vidual such as Bentley, who later became
so prominent in RIS activities in the
United States, then the possibility always
exists that the names of persons later con-
nected with OSS (Office of Strategic Services)
and other governmental activity may also be
mentioned in the 1934-40 Daily Worker issues,
which have heretofcre never been indexed by
any government agency.

"Because of the obvious value of
having access to such an index, the writer
(McCord) recommends that we encourage the
continuation of Wiley's index project in
any way in which we are able to further
such work."
(There is no objective evidence in the file other than
the above to support Wiley's contention that he was given
encouragement by Mr. DeLoach of the FBI to continue the pro-
ject.)
The above was brought to the attention of Harlan
Westrell (Chief, Counterintelligence Branch, SRS), who
in turn brought the matter to the attention of Colonel
Sheffield Edwards, Director of Security, circa early
December 1955.
Via a memorandum dated 19 December 1955, McCord
informed Westrell of the receipt of additional correspon-
dence from Wiley, and McCord included a rehash of the
metter including statements:
"I hope the Office of Security
can encourage the continuation of the
project, at least until the index is
completed up through 1940, which would
take about another year of work by Wiley.
The index has considerable potential CE
(counter espionage) value to this Office,
for one thing, by virtue of the fact that
there will be numerous heretofore unidenti-
fied Communists' names turn up in the
index, some of whom went underground
during the World War II years. The
index may give us the one clue neces-
sary to detect any such penetration

in protecting the Agency thereby is of
course inestimable. The continuation
of the project would have other merits,
which we have discussed previously."
McCord also recommended that, should the project fail,
the Agency consider employing Wiley.

ACTIVITIES
March 1956 June 1959
In mid-March 1956, through a letter by McCord extended
from his home address, arrangements were made for Wiley to
come to Washington, D. C., for three days to brief Hazel
Mackie, Personnel Pool (Office of Personnel), on certain
administrative matters for the processing and typing of the
index. The Personnel Pool work would result in 8 full copies
of the index: three copies to the Security Office, one copy
to Staff D, one copy to CI Staff, one copy for the FBI, one
copy for the American Legion and one copy for Wiley.
(It is presumed that a copy of the index was given to
the FBI; however, there is no document which could be located
that states a copy was in fact given to the FBI.)
Concurrent with McCord's interest in Wiley, he and
Morse Allen (SRS) were working on Operation Recovery.

Attendant to this operation, by April 1956, Wiley
at the request of McCord had completed:
a. A summary of newspaper items on

Wiley was sent his first check covering the index pro-
ject on 9 April 1956. By 22 May 1956, he had met Morse
Allen.
McCord further reported on 1 May 1956 that during dis-
cussion with Wiley he told Wiley that there are three areas
in which he could work during the coming year (1956-57)
which would be of interest and would enhance his value to
CIA. One would be the continuation of the index project,
another would be the continuation of regular contact with
his sources of information in New York City, keeping CIA
advised of anything that may be pertinent to our areas of
interest. The third would be the building for him a cover
story which would enable him to contact and interview various
ex-Communists and ex-Soviet agents in the New York area.
Wiley told McCord that he, Wiley, was in contact with
Herbert Philbrick during the spring of 1956. and asked
McCord to work on getting him, Wiley, some

On 20 March 1957, McCord informed his supervisor that
Wiley's work on the index project would expire in May 1957.
McCord indicated he would like to use Wiley for another year
on the indexing project.
On 13 April 1957, Wiley tendered additional materials
from the indexing project; a copy of an article by Alfred
Kohlberg, "A Red Dream"; an open letter to the President
of the United States requesting either a new trial or par-
don for Morton Sobell, attaching a list of 200 signers; and
a list of publications and organizations fighting Communism
in the U.S. prepared by Herb Philbrick, given to Wiley.
Wiley was advised that he may be called upon soon to work
on some material on Soviet Espionage (David Dallin material,
a noted author of books on Soviet Intelligence), requiring
about one month's work; that he may be called upon to fol-
low the Albam (Jacob Albam) trial developments in the press;
and that an attempt would be made to renew his grant for
another year.

On 21 June 1957, Harlan A. Westrell, Chief, SRS, re-
quested the Director of Security for authorization to con-
tinue the Daily Worker indexing project for one year which
had yielded approximately 500,000 names in the index.
22 August 1957, Sheffield Edwards, Director of Security,
requested and received, such authorization for circa
$10,000 from the Deputy Director of Support.

During this period (1956-1959), Wiley worked with
Herbert Philbrick on a book which Philbrick was preparing
entitled "The Most Dangerous Group in the World." He also
From 5 to 19 January 1959, Wiley made a fact-finding
trip through the Mid-West and the Southeastern states of
the U.S. contacting newspapers, "conservative" individuals,
police agencies, and information repositories to determine
the extent of their information concerning Communism and
the Communist movement.
During the summer of 1959, SRS initiated and completed
2 study through wijev of the Columbia University newspaper,
"Spectator" and the City College of New York newspaper.
This, unlike the Daily Worker index, was a study of the
various issues for information pertaining to Communists
and radical organizations and individuals. Don Ingles,
Wiley's cousin, conducted the study and was paid for his
time.
Financial records indicate that the indexing project's
gross funding from March 1956 through May 1957 was $10,000.
Out of that amount, Wiley was given $8,600 in salary and the
other $1,400 was for expenses. The same total amount was
approved for the period June 1957 through May 1958 and was
expended as follows: $7,900 for salary payments and $2,100
for expenses. A like amount ($10,000) was set aside for
the period June 1958 through June 1959 and expended at the
rate of $734.17 per month in salary payments and the rest,
$265.83, in expenses.
In connection with the index, Wiley was also given
specific requests to compile reports on several individ-
uals and organizations which were of peripheral interest.

On 1 July 1959, this Agency entered into contract
with Wiley, as an independent contractor, at the salary
rate of $9,100 per annum, with additional compensation
in the amount of 5% of the above sum, to be paid in
quarterly installments, representing the Government's
contribution toward Wiley's choice of programs for insur-
ance, retirement, medical and health. The contract speci-
fied that he would be reimbursed for operational travel
as directed by OS, and for other approved operational
expenses, subject to accounting applicable with Govern-
ment regulations.
The annual compensation was subsequently increased
on 1 July 1960 to $9,900 per annum and on 1 July 1961 to
$10,500 per annum, plus additional 5% as noted above.
Salary has remained at the latter level to the date of
his termination. The contract was to run for an inde-
finite neriod, and could be terminated without notice in
the event of a breach of contract or by Wiley rendering
himself unavailable for acceptable service, and could
otherwise be terminated by either Wiley or the Agency
with 90 days' notice.
From 1955 to 1959, Wiley was paid in cash, and for
several years after the contract was signed, officers of
SRS continued to pay Wiley his salary either in cash or
through bank money orders. In 1964 раyments of salary
were made by the Office of Finance directly into his bank
account in New York City.
From 1959 to the present time, SRS obtained a copy
of each year's Federal Income Tax Return, and on at least
two occasions, Wiley was given a personal briefing on the
management of the Agency funds, vis-a-vis income from his
self-established firm, World News Analysis, by Agency
Finance Officers. In 1964, because of his failure to
comply with the SRS's instructions to furnish complete
details on his claimed expenses, the regular payment of
"operational" expenses was terminated, necessitating that
he reduce expenses which were not reimburseable from the
firm's income.

Regarding his overseas travel, for the early years,

once World News Analysis had become established and had

token contribution was made toward lengthy trips.

ACTIVITIES, July 1959 - January 1974
WORLD YOUTH FESTIVAL, VIENNA 1959
Shortly after Wiley signed his contract with this
Agency, he became involved in the World Youth Festival
(WYF) held in Vienna during July 1959.
A memo dated 19 February 1959 to the Acting Chief,
SRS, from Helene Finan (SRS) reports on a meeting between
Finan and Wiley at which Wiley furnished information rela-
tive to the forthcoming WYF to be held in Europe in mid-
summer 1959. According to this memo and an accompanying
one, Wiley said that

On 18 May 1959, Morse Allen wrote a memo to the
Chief, SRS that Wiley is now a newspaperman and a maga-
zine writer, accredited under the auspices of the North
American Newspaper Alliance, the Spades Syndicate, The
Indianapolis Star, The Richmond Times Dispatch and pro-
bably several several other publications. Wiley is a member of
an anti-Communist group privately sponsored who will attend
the Vienna Youth Festival and will make themselves known
during the Festival. Wiley will probably cover the Festi-
val for the Newhouse Newspaper Chain, National Review and
U.S. News and World Report. He has received $500 in pri-
vate subscriptions to cover the cost of his transportation
to the WYF. The cost of his proposed itinerary amounts to
$1,056.70 for transportation.
Allen recommended the Office
of Security pay the additional cost of $556.70 with the
understanding that any remuneration received from his
writings be offset on an equitable basis.
On 19 May 1959, James McCord noted to Allen, "Ok, see
me,
referring to the request to approve the additional
cost and possible later offset. There is a 16 June report
From jier acknowledging receipt of $556.70.
The New York Times reported on 3 August 1959 that
Charles Wiley, his wife, and Joanne Mellor, a British sub-
ject living in New York City, were "roughed up" when they
attempted to join a parade of Eastern Bloc delegates to
the WYF. Wiley and company waited until the parade had
started and then unfolded their banners with such slogans
as "Remember Hungary," "Remember Tibet," and "What About
Soviet Imperialism?" That incident got much press cover-
age, particularly because Wiley's wife was obviously preg-
nant.
A 14 September 1959 memo for the record from Wiley
reflects that in a meeting with staff members of the HCUA,
Wiley was instrumental in talking HCUA out of holding
hearings which would be intended partially to expose the
alleged inept, but expensive, effort made by CIA to
The Director of Security memo-
randa concerning the foregoing was forwarded to the Legis-
lative Counsel on the 16th and 25th of September 1959 and
the 27th of October 1959. They were also forwarded to the
Office of the DCI.

In February 1960, Wiley did testify before HCUA as
an expert regarding the 7th WYF and covered "violence"
against himself and other anti-Communists and the Commu-
nist dominance of delegations,
On or about 1 April 1960, the House Committee on
Un-American Activities was interested in consultations
with Wiley based on articles by Wiley appearing in the
American Legion Magazine, Elks magazine, National Review,
and the Ukranian Quarterly, apparently based on Wiley's
observations of Iron Curtain countries derived from his
travels to the USSR, the World Youth Festival in Vienna,
and other Iron Curtain countries during the summer of
1959. (In February 1960, Wiley had testified before
HCUA about his experiences at the Vienna Youth Festival.)
The HCUA staff members interested in Wiley were Francis
McNamara and Richard Arens.
During the course of his trip to the WYF, Wiley
apparently drew some official attention to himself in
Israel.
Circa 20 August 1959, a State Department memorandum
was forwarded to McCord regarding conversations William
Anthony, Press Officer, American Embassy, Tel Aviv, Israel,
had with Wiley at the American Embassy on 20 and 21 July
1959. In substance, Anthoney stated Wiley represented
himself as a columnist connected with the "Newhouse Chain"
but in his questioning of Anthony about Israeli politics,
he (Wiley) "tries to give the impression he either is in
or just outside the Washington intelligence community."
Upon receipt of this memo, McCord advised Morse Allen,
SRS, "We need to straighten Wiley out on being too clan-
destine."
Circa September 1959, Wiley prepared five reports
relevant to some of his travels to the Middle East, Soviet
Union and Austria attendant to activities of the World
Youth Festival in Vienna in the summer of 1959. One report
