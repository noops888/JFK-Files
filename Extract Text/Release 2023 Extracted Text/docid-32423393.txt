it would be helpful to have a few background first.
2
Senator Baker.
If I may say so, so that Mr. Angleton
3
will not be taken by surprise, there are one or two things that
4
I would like to discuss.
The nature of that material would be
5
similar to what you have already discussed with Rockefeller,
6
having to do with the Oswald situation and other things.
7
Mr. Angleton.
Well, to begin with, I went into OSS in
8
9
1943, in 1943 from the infantry. And then Iwas assigned to an
embryonic counter intelligence unit under General
10
Donovan. My immediate
chief
was James R. Murphy, who had been
11
12
a protegee and obtained his law degree in General Donovan's
office. And he is a practicing attorney here in Washington.
13
14
15
And he was Chief of X-2, which was the counter intelligence.
And during that time a number of us were put together who
had never had any experience in the subject.
And that included
16
17

people such as Jonnie Oaks, who was the head of the editorial
page of the New York Times, and Ben Wells and a tremendous
cross-section of American life.
And there was a training intensive in this country, and
I was sent to London. And the purpose of that was to ab-
sorb the British experience, and more important the breaking
of German codes.
The breaking of the German codes, which is relevant to
our activity, was really done in England.
And by way
digression, the Germans were using a receiver machine called

Enigma, the blue prints of which were originally obtained by
a Frenchman. And I might add that the Frenchman never re-
ceived credit for it. And yet that perhaps was the most
8
single important breakthrough of the entire war. And he had
obtained it about eitht to nine or ten years prior to the out-
break of war, when it was non-operative. And he had the
prescience to know that the systems could only be one thing,
that it would be operative in a time of war.
I give this digression simply to point out that the
fruits of that breakthrough would first go to the military
and the military operations. And the counter intelligence
use of it would be the bottom of the list of priorities, in
one sense.
But it would mean that a compromise of the material
in any fashion to the Germans would destroy the military
uses. And during the war or when the Germans went into the
war, they brought it up from 10 percent recovery to about
100 percent

the Battle of Tobruk was fought on six intercepts.
So our job was to make use of the counter intelligence
for the purpose of playing back German agents to their high
command. And this was an elaborate deception. And when the
war ended I would say that 99 percent of all reporting agents

that the Germans had were under our control. And in fact
when many of the German hierarchy tried to escape to the
west under aliases, their only point of contact for most
documentation and money was to our agent under control.
And it was called the Safe Haven program.
So London was in a sense a staging area with full access
to British, or the fruits of British activity, going back
through their entire history.
And it was the advance head-
quarters for General Donovan, and Mr. Murphy.
I was then sent to Italy in 1943. And I took over the
counter intelligence for Italy, the OSS, AFIHO, Allied Forces
Ileadquarters.
Subsequently I became the Chief of OSS Italy.
And
I want to say that my work then became more broad in terms of
espionage and all the other branches of OSS.
And I re-estab-
lished the counter/intelligence services.
French back into existence, particularly the man who
originally acquired the code, and who worked on it for many
years.
And by this time it was shifted to the Saudi bloc.
I left Italy in 1947 or 1948 and came back, and was
discharged and went into the Agency immediately. And during
the period I was in the Agency, of course, I had both agent
operations, long distance operations, and counter intelligence,
and some sabotage, black propaganda, infiltration.
And probably the first overnight operation that there was

which was known as Plan Hope, which is simply putting the
Italians in an airplane and having them fly over to the
Roumanian border and make very primitive photographs of the
whole region.
nd I was sent back to the Air Force. And then I had
code operations, embassy penetrations, and so on.
So. in a sense
the resuscitation of the Italian service,
Army and Navy, Air Force, and the Minister of the Interior,
was American rehabilitation. And I am not going to go into
the details of the political situation.
There was the
civil war in Greece, and the revival of the international
Brigade and in fact the Soviets had built up, when they were
not fighting the war, in the post-war period, assassinations,
and instability.
And throughout this we had very close supervision from
Mr. Murphy, and General Donovan. And we had special interest
in the Vatican, and what was happening in Berlin behind the
Curtain.
And the then acting Secretary of State for the Vatican,

to do through our channels, and General Donovan, with Montini,
the Pope, who is now the Pope, one of the basic problems was
the cold war. We did not buy the cold war, it came to us
and we worked with the Germans, and as we broke down the
Fopposition, we began to find that we were not getting the

Germans, we were getting the Soviets.
But the penetrations and the operations which we gran
during the military phase began to take on a character of
their own in the civilian phase in the very long term Soviet
objectives against the U.S. in particular, and against the
allies
And then I got into all fields of ylabor, subversion,
illegal immigrants, and then revolution. I was in
And our penetrations at that period were fairly high level and
sophisticated, because of the reaction to Stalin.
And as the Soviet troops occupied new territories, it
was faced with these ambiguities, the defectors coming
over to us at very high levels.
And in the course of this, of course, was the Israeli
immigration. Technically we were still a part of AFHQ, which
was a combined and Allied Headquarters. And the British desires
were that our activities be directed in supporting their
responsibilities in the Middle East, and, therefore, to pre-
vent the immigration.
And I think the only policy cable that was ever re-
ceived during that period was one we sent to Mr. Murphy, and
through General Donovan to the President. That
was where we exercised our influences on the Italians to
prevent immigration.
And they addressed themselves to
to this
issue, and they came back with an ambiguity, but it leaned

toward the general proposition that we should not
discourage the British nor hurt the British directly, but
we should not interfere with the Italians to support the
British position.
And so my dealings were with Admiral Maugeria, who
had been Chief of the Italian Naval Intelligence, but was
then the Commanding Admiral of the Turanian Fleet generally
south, where all these illegal immigrants collected and were
sent down.
And the man

we had the members of the
group, and then we had the dilemma again as to whether we
turned them over to the British authorities, and so on.
And we were in a position to make decisions one way or
the other And eventually we came down on the side of re-
leasing them.
And there is so much more of it. I am trying to keep
the thread of it.
Mr. schwarz. So you developed some kind of a relation-
ship, perhaps a friendly relationship, with persons connected
with the new State of Israel or the hoped for state of
Israeli back in the 1940's?
Mr. Angleton. That is right.

account, if that is the right ex-
Mr. Angleton. There wasn't one after I left there,
nor was there one here in Washington.
But the other side of the
problem was that you
had thousands coming from the Soviet Union. And you had the
Soviets making use of the immigration for the purpose of
sending illegal agents into the West and breaking down all
the travel control, identifications and so on.
And so there was both a security problem and a political
problem. And one of my men married, I might say, the head of
the Zionist movement in Italy, the underground.
So I had
a connection to this man.
He was very important.
So,coming back to Washington, I was Special Assistant
to Colonal Donald/IH? Galloway, who was head of the
clandestine side and covered the world, on all sides of
clandestine activity.
And subsequently I was Chief of Operations for Es-
pionage
And in 1954 I had a special operational unit, and was
made head of the counter intelligence.
Mr. Schwarz. In the period beginning in 1954 and lasting
until 1974, when you left the Agency, did you have any
relationship
is the Israeli account the wrong way to say it?

Mr. Angleton.
It is all right. It is as good as ny
other.
Mr. Schwarz. Did you have any relationship with the
account?
Mr Angleton. No. That began in 1951. There was no
relationship between the Agency and the
Mr. Schwarz.
You mean at all, or prior to 1951.
Mr. Angleton. There wasn't any from 1947

1946 on.
Mr. Schwarz. Then it began in 1951.
And all
I am trying to establish, and not spend a lot of time with it,
is, do you have any relationship with
JFK Act 5 (g) (2) (D)
on behalf of the Agency between
1951 and 1974.
Mr. Angleton. It was resonstituted in 1951. And I was the
negotiator of the arrangement.
was at the other end of the negotiation.
He was
stationed in Washington. But during the
period

during the war and
prior.
Mr. Miller. How was that agreement negotiated?
Mr Angleton. It was negotiated by finding waat
dis we have in common. It was reviewed by Admiral Hillenkoetter
who was then Director.
And he was to be succeeded by General
Walter Bedell Smith. And the decision was made during the
war that Bedell Smith was to take over, and Allen Dulles returne

to this activity, that we would go ahead and re-establish a
relationship. And after a lot of bureaucratic problems, they
gave me the account.
Mr. Miller. What ws the nature of the arrangement that
was agreed upon between the
Mr. Angleton. In most simplistic terms, they were in-
formed that we would not work with them against the Arabs,
that we would work with them on Soviet intelligence and
Soviet bloc Intelligence and communism, where it existed.
Mr. Schwarz. Did that agreement
which I take it was
more flexible that but did it remain in effect throughout
the period of your service with the Agency?
Mr. Angleton.
More or less.
Mr. Miller.
Was this agreement in the form of a
paper?
Mr.Angleton.
Paper and operations, discussion.
MF Miller. And under whose authority was the agree-
ment made?
Mr. Angleton.
Under the authority of the Director of
Central Intelligence, and the
JFK Act 5 (g) (2) (D)
on
the other side.
Mr. Miller. And this involved the exchange of resources
of both countries?
Mr. Angleton.
The term "resources" is not quite
correct.
Everything except their own people.
It was giving
TOP SECRET-
WARD & PAUL
JFK Act 5 (g)(2)(D)
Phone (Ares 202) 544-6000
TOP SECRET
Mr. Miller. So the Director of Central Intelligence was
aware of the agreement.
Was the President?
Mr. Angleton. The President was aware of it. And the
Secretary of State was the brother of the Deputy Chief of the
CIA, and eventually was very much involved.
Mr. Miller. Where is a record of this agreement kept,
as an instrument of the U.S.?
Mr. Angleton.
The internal papers would be in the Agency.
The letters, copies of the letters from
to the
President of to the Secretary of State I assume are still in
the Agency.
I dealt with other departments in connection
with Africa, and so on, underdeveloped areas.
If you are speaking as to whether there was a representa-
tive treaty which was cleared
--
and people wanted these
things cleared
I don't think there were any clearances
obtained from the Hill.
Mr. Miller. Was it regarded as an obligation
commitment from the U.S. to
on certain matters?
Mr. Angleton. When you use the word U.S. while you
may use it as contracting officers and all that, there was
very little reduced to writing. And it is a custom of
Intelligence that intelligence supersedes writing. And
there have been very few directors to my knowledge that would
TOP SECRET-
WARD & PAUL
JFK Act 5 (g)(2)(D)
Phone (Ares 202) 544-600
TOP SECRET
put their pen to hand to sign an agreement to some under
standing. It is based on a fiduciary relationship and common
understanding.
So, these were all understandings that wéré
generated by events. WE had the arrest of the nine doctors,
and the pogrom in Russia. And obviously you didn't go through
a lot of bureaucracy, it was there for everyone to see.
And it had a direct impact on the question of immigration of
agents, and everything else that goes along with it. And
I think that characterizes any good operation.
Mr. Miller
How was it possible for succeeding directors
of the intelligence agency to understand what the
agreements were between, in this case the
JFK Act 5 (g) (2) (D)
and the U.S. Intelligence Service?
Mr. Angleton, Very simple. They saw the production to
begin with. And they met with directors or the head of
JFK Act 5 (g) (2) (D) And they met with Ambassadors and prime
ministers. And they were very much involved.
Mr. Schwarz. Just one more background question and
then we will turn to the principle subject.
Following through on the subject of
up to your
departure in 1974, is there any connection between your de-
parture and handling of
And if there is, what is
the connection?
Mr. Angleton. Well, I think I have said it all to the
TOP SECRET-
WARD & PAUL
Phone (Ares 202) 544-60
TOP SECRET
commission
--
I don't know how wisely. You can always get
different information from different people. But Colby
told them, so I would like to give him the benefit of the
doubt on it. But over a period of time Colby
who is not my
cup of tea professionally or in any other way, and in my
view is on the negative side of life
and Dr. Schlesinger,
before he went to Defense, said that Colby was the only other
person on Watergate
So you have got certain persons who
were prominent. And there was the negative aspect of
self-inspection, and inferiors reporting on superiors, until
they came through the snake pit.
And in the course of all of this there was time when
he assumed the authority, and in
otal contrast to Schlesinger,
he began to regard the
account as some-
thing where we had to open the windows and let the air in.
And he used phrases such as, we must help out Henry and a few
other things.
Any/position was that it was a political relationship,
and that we were not bound, or should not be bound to using
the Agency on tactical ventures when we had relationships
which had strategic implications.
But one must rembmer that there are still three
million Jews in the Soviet Union. And the relationship is the
only place where you do it with high level agencies who work
for ideology and do not work for money.
So it is unique.
TOP SECRET-
WARD & PAUL
Phone (Ares 202) 544-60
TOP SECRET
And my second point was that everything should be run
on the grounds of need-to-know, and should not go into the Arab
Division until there was peace in the area. There was no
identity of interest or fundamental interest between
and an example is
JFK Act 5 (g) (2) (D)
And the Soviets had worked with
the Poles in the West, and trained them
had the cohesion of 27 bloc services working together through
their own congress party apparatus into a collective with
Moscow.
And most important, our job was to preserve the inte-
grity of the immigration from the bloc, because the problem
of escape to Israel is a religious problem, it is not a
political problem. There could not be a prime minister who
would survive the day if he did not go along with the idea of
the return.
And, therefore, there is a certain kind of parallelism,
you might say, between handling the communications intelligence
during the war and where a low priority makes use of it and
endangers the whole with the question of immigration,
where the fruits of that immigration come to this government.

Senator Tower. Will you go ahead and resume the question

relationship

Mr. Angleton.
It is all right. It is as good as ny
other.
Mr. Schwarz. Did you have any relationship with the
account?
Mr Angleton. No. That began in 1951. There was no
relationship between the Agency and the
Mr. Schwarz.
You mean at all, or prior to 1951.
Mr. Angleton. There wasn't any from 1947
--
1946 on.
Mr. Schwarz. Then it began in 1951.
And all
I am trying to establish, and not spend a lot of time with it,
is, do you have any relationship with
JFK Act 5 (g) (2) (D)
on behalf of the Agency between
1951 and 1974.
Mr. Angleton. It was resonstituted in 1951. And I was the
negotiator of the arrangement.
was at the other end of the negotiation.
He was
stationed in Washington. But during the
period
JFK Act 5 (g) (2) (D)
during the war and
prior.
Mr. Miller. How was that agreement negotiated?
Mr Angleton. It was negotiated by finding waat
dis we have in common. It was reviewed by Admiral Hillenkoetter
who was then Director.
And he was to be succeeded by General
Walter Bedell Smith. And the decision was made during the
war that Bedell Smith was to take over, and Allen Dulles returne

to this activity, that we would go ahead and re-establish a
relationship. And after a lot of bureaucratic problems, they
gave me the account.
Mr. Miller. What ws the nature of the arrangement that
was agreed upon between the
Mr. Angleton. In most simplistic terms, they were in-
formed that we would not work with them against the Arabs,
that we would work with them on Soviet intelligence and
Soviet bloc Intelligence and communism, where it existed.
Mr. Schwarz. Did that agreement
which I take it was
more flexible that but did it remain in effect throughout
the period of your service with the Agency?
Mr. Angleton.
More or less.
Mr. Miller.
Was this agreement in the form of a
paper?
Mr.Angleton.
Paper and operations, discussion.
MF Miller. And under whose authority was the agree-
ment made?
Mr. Angleton.
Under the authority of the Director of
Central Intelligence, and the
JFK Act 5 (g) (2) (D)
on
the other side.
Mr. Miller. And this involved the exchange of resources
of both countries?
Mr. Angleton.
The term "resources" is not quite
correct.
Everything except their own people.
It was giving

Mr. Miller. So the Director of Central Intelligence was
aware of the agreement.
Was the President?
Mr. Angleton. The President was aware of it. And the
Secretary of State was the brother of the Deputy Chief of the
CIA, and eventually was very much involved.
Mr. Miller. Where is a record of this agreement kept,
as an instrument of the U.S.?
Mr. Angleton.
The internal papers would be in the Agency.
The letters, copies of the letters from
to the
President of to the Secretary of State I assume are still in
the Agency.
I dealt with other departments in connection
with Africa, and so on, underdeveloped areas.
If you are speaking as to whether there was a representa-
tive treaty which was cleared
--
and people wanted these
things cleared
I don't think there were any clearances
obtained from the Hill.
Mr. Miller. Was it regarded as an obligation
