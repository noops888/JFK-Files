The following items have been extracted from OIRA 56011
from Rome, dated 1972. These are the only references
to KORENGOLD in that dispatch.
IDEN C Robert J. KORENGOLD, Newsweek's
Moscow.correspondent
(The writer, a staff officer, in conversation with an
Italian journalist/Subject.)
"Subject.opened the conversation by saying that
he had known IDEN C in Moscow rather well. In fact,
there was even collaboration on several pieces they
did. IDEN C. recently did a series of articles on
different areas in the Soviet Union and Subject said he
had discussed the articles with IDEN C almost a year ago.
Further, their wifes were good friends because they are
both French and they enjoyed speaking to each other.
Subject also said they had been in Paris together on
vacation although (the writer) does not know if they
were accompanied by their husbands. (The Writer) asked
if Subject spoke English with IDEN C and Subject answered
no, that they spoke Russian and their wives French. He
said specifically that he does not speak English."
