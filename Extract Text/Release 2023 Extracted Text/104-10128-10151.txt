1. Reference is made to memorandum of 12 June 1969,
05,08
on Gerhard HOLLANDER, #242438235963 According to a notation
by DCS on their listing of available reports regarding the 1963
Conference of the International Federation for Automatic Controls,
held in Basel, Switzerland, one of the sources on the conference
apparently was D. D. D. DO PIDHAYNY of Aerospace, Corp., who was
related in some way to HOLLANDER, or to the HOLLANDER
debriefing by DCS.

2. Denny D. PIDHAYNY, #409 988 - BZ, and C-3005627,
02 has been of past interest to DCS, to SR Division, under the
AE HOLLY Operation, and to DO/SR. File indicates an unresolved
question as to whether (PIDHAYNY is identical to a Communist of
the same name in Michigan.

3. In December 1963, OO/C advised PSD that [PIDHAYNY
who had been in correspondence with Soviet scientist Alexis G.
IVAKHNENKO, reported that IVAKHNENKO, mentioned he had
been a next door neighbor of the American defector, Libero
RICCIARDELLI, in Kiev, In October 1963, IVAKΗΝΕΝΚΟ had asked
that PIDHAYNY write a welcoming letter to RICCIARDELLI, who had
left the USSR for his home in Massachusetts, and that the Soviet was
interested in learning of RICCIARDELLI's "destiny" after he arrived.
It was obvious from the content of the report that RICCIARDELLI was
continuing in correspondence with IVAKHNENKO after he returned to
the U.S.

4. DCS suggested in this connection that the former
defector might be a valuable source of information on
IVAKHNENKO, having lived next door to him for a few years.

5. As of 1966, PIDHAYNY) was still in communication
with IVAKHNENKO, and copies of the correspondence were to
be turned over to the FBI through PSD.
