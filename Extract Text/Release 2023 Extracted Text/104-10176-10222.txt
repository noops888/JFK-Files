1. Forwarded herewith for Headquarters information and
files is an Agent Service Record on LIP ING-3.
2. As Addressees are aware, haliace P. ROWTON recruited
and formerly handled LIRING-3 for the Hexico City Station.
Prior to ROTON'S PCS departure from Mexico City in July 1969,
it was deciced, after some discussion, to effect a turnover of
LIRING-3, rather than terminate him. Although LIRING-3 apparently
I had been well "burned" with the Cubans, he seemed to have maintained
Igood contacts with members of the Rebel Armed Forces (FAR) of
Guatemala. In addition, in May and June of this year, he had
begun to develop access to some Panamanian revolutionaries of
interest. It was therefore decided to rur LIRING-3 on a trial
basis to determine whether he could be used effectively against
Central American revolutionary targets, despite his problems with
the Cubans.
نه
3. ROWTON introduced Leonard S. TORMET, in alias, to LIRING-3
on 1 July 1969. Although ROWTON had represented himself to LIRING-3
as a Greek businessman, it was decided that it would be preferable
to "clear the air" somewhat with LIRING-3, at least by making it

clear that he was in touch with a WOLADY organization. Nonethe-
less, no specific explaration was given LIRING-3 of his sponsor
and he requested none. LIRING-3 was told that TORMET would be
seeing him for some months, since ROWTON was leaving the country
for an indefinite period.
4. LIRING-3 was told that although TORMET was trusted by
ROWTON and collaborated with him, he represented a different
organization. LIRING-3 was also told that although he had in the
past been receiving between 3,000.00 and 3,500.00 Mexican pesos
per month on an informal basis, TORMET's organization feit that
1,500 Mexican pesos per month ($120.00) woula te a fair salary at
this stage of the operation. TORMET explained that he was aware
of LIRING-3's past activities directed against tre Cubans, and the
resultant problems which had arisen. It was explained that
TORMET'S interest was in Central American revolutionary activities.
In order to deal with LIRING-3's virtua! "burneo" status with the
Cubans, he was directed to tell any Central American contacts that
the Cubans no longer trusted him, and that he therefore was no
longer directly involved with any revolutionary groups or activities.
Nonetheless, LIRING-3 was directed to offer any assistance which
ne coula provice to any revolucionaries, on the basis of His
leftist beliefs and the friendships which he had made with FAR
members while in prison in Guatemala. It would then be a matter
of time before we could learn whether LIRING-3 es complete
blacklisted in all revolutionary circles because of his problems
with the Cubans or whether he could provide information of value.
5. LIRING-3 throughout the meeting seemed in good spirits
Indeed,
and he seemed to accept the turnover without any qualms.
he pointed out that the Cubans had lost trust in him only after
he had been given various tasks to do by RUWTON which he had known
and warned in advance would cause suspicion. It was agreed that
LIRING-3's troubles were not of his own making, but that at this
stage all that could te done was to attempt to circumvent the
existing problems.
6. LIRING-3 was given a Station non-attributable telephone
number and false name to ask for (Identity) to set up meetings
with TORMET. Only the meeting time was to be set by phone, and
a prearranged pickup point was decided upon. It should be noted
that TORMET'S QP vehicle was used for this first meeting with
LIRING-3, which means it was of course exposed to LIRING-3.
7. Subsequent to this meeting, LIRING-3 never initiated
contact with the Station. Although he might have lost the new
telephone number he was given to use with TORMET, there is no
Indication he ever again tried to call ROWTON, who was in Mexico
for at least three weeks after the I July turnover to TORMET.
8. The Station assumes that for whatever reasons, LIRING-3
has in effect terminated himself. Given the nature of this case--
the fact that LIRING-3 was denounced in Cuban official circles as
a RVROCK agent, the fact that LIRING-3 in over two years was never
very productive and now the apparent decision of LIRING-3 to break
off contact--it has been decided to make no effort to reestablish
contact with him.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
FROM:
WH/1
SUBJECT:
!
17 September 1968 discussion with DRISCOLL
re LIRING/3 & LIRING/4.
PARTICIPANTS: DRISCOLL, KERBE, FRANCIS and Laurence
PIPER (C/WII/2/G).
1. LIRING/4 is still very concerned about the im-
prisonment of LIRING/3. LIRING/4 will not travel to Cuba
until she is assured of the gafety TIDING.
L/3
has thoroughly discussed L/3 with L/4 and has pointed out
the danger of attempting to intercede on L/3's behalf
through business contacts, L/4 contacted the Cubans for
assistance but they stated there was nothing they could do.
They have assisted L/4 with small amounts of money.
has devised an open code which he uses in letters to let
L/4 know how he is. The letters are grim reading because
L/3 keeps stating he is unable to hold out much longer.
Fellow prisoners have warned L/4 not to let the Guats
transfer him to another prison as this usually ends in the
prisoner being shot "while escaping." One good result
from the continued imprisonment of L/3 is that both he and
L/4 are furthering their bona fides with the Cubans.
2. L/4 is in telephone contact with the Third Secre-
i
tary of the Mexican Embassy in Guatemala. He has made
inquiries about L/3 with the Guats on behalf of Foreign
Minister CARRILLO Flores. A few weeks ago (prior to the
assasination of the U.S. Ambassador) the Third Secretary
told L/4 there were three possibilities, the first which
he considered out of the question was that L/3 would be
shot, the second was that L/4 would come to trial and be
released within a few weeks, and the third was that he would
receive a sentence of two or three years. Just prior to
departing Mexico on this current trip, DRISCOLL attempted
to arrange a meet with L/4 in the usual means by slipping a
typed note under her apartment door. She did not make the
meeting. DRISCOLL later learned through phone tap material
that she called the Cuban Labassy and informed them the
SECRET
201-798301
1.

COORET
-2-
Mexican authorities had notified her she was being fined
500 pesos. The purpose of the payment was not identified.
Later she made a call from the Cuban Embassy which indicated
she was staying there until she could get the funds to pay
the Mexicans. DRISCOLL. therefore, concluded she had not
returned to her apartment and did not get the note to make
their meeting. DRISCOLL said SUAREZ (the visiting Cuba
Cultural type) has a key to L/3's apartment and might see
the note but would be unable to identify the sender since
DRISCOLL uses a meaningless scenas a signature.
3. DRISCOLL now plans upon his return to Mexico to
recontact L/4 to get the latest reading
Guatemala. If the Mexican Charge is unable to obtain L/3's
release ir behalf of the Mexicans and if it appears he will
be held indefinately, DRISCOLL wants to explore the possibility
of our doing something to get L/3 out so the operation can
become active again.
4. In the above regard L/3 was discussed with Mr. PIPER
of the Guatemala desk. Mr. PIPER believed the Station has
a high enough contact with the Guats (ESMAJOR/20-Presidents
brother) to arrange to get L/3 and his Vexican compatriot oul
of prison and back to Mexico with a minimun security risk.
DRISCOLL said he would initiate the cable upon his return to
Mexico after he has talked with L/4. DRISCOLL felt he should
possibly travel to Guatemala and have a preliminary meet with
L/3 before Guat Station makes any all out effort to officially
request L/3's release. If, after seeing L/3 DRISCOLL is satis-
fied that L/3 is still an ally and is willing to cooperate
after his release then DRISCOLL believes we should attempt to
have the Station intercede with ESMAJOR/20. Hopefully, ESMAJOR/
20 will arrange the release so that all involved believe it
has been done at the request and urging of the Mexican Govern-
ment. DRISCOLL, however, would like L/3 and L/4 to believe
he (DRISCOLL) had something to do with the release in order
to raise his status with both for the sake of future operation-
al tasks he will levy on them.
