OFFICE MEMORANDUM
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
TO : Ch/SB/1
Att: Mr. Fred Bucci
DATE: 21 Sept 1960
FROM : Ch/SB/3
SUBJECT: CHRIST, David
(Live Address - Westchester County)
#43872
On 16 September 1960 SAC/MFO was telephonically advised that SUBJECT
was one of several Americans reportedly arrested in Havana, and in anticipat-
ion of publicity in the local newspapers, including mention of the ostensible
residence of "Daniel CARSWELL", a live address in Eastchester set up by
MFO - requested to have Mr. (Barry), the live addressee, briefed with details
of the SUBJECT'S cover story, procured from Dick Bilad√©an, CCD/MOC. In
some minor details this story differs from that supplied by Jack Kennedy,
JMARC, who requested the live address.
MFO was advised that GOLIATH employment or interest in SUBJECT was not
to be indicated to Barry and advised that this cover story was applicable
if the publicity identified SUBJECT in his pseudo identity. In the event
of true name identification and employment by the Cubans it was explained
that further instructions would have to be given, since the matter of
acknowledgement of these individuals in such case was for presidential
decision, reportedly being made on Sept.
Per Biladeau, SUBJECT, as "CARSKELL" is a production management consult-
ant, employed since May 1960 by Victor A. VACHUTA and Associates, 576
5th Avenue, NYC. Prior to this he had worked in a similar capacity for
the Air Force and had been stationed abroad extensively. He has been on
vacation from Vachuta since 2 September. Biladeau advised that the
Vachuta employment is backstopped by a telephone answering service
arrangements, which has been instructed similarly to acknowledge SUBJECT
in the event of inquiry.
Subsequent information from Joe Langan, JMARC Security Officer explains why
SUBJECT was backstopped thru JMARC to the extent he was, and the other two
TSD technicians were not. The operation on which they were sent to Havana
was an HARVEST one, under FE direction. On his own initiative Christ
checked with Langan, was briefed and backstopped. The other two never
passed through JMARC, orders cut, briefings handled, etc, by FE.
