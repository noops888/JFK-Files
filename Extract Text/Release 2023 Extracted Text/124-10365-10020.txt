PREFACE
TOP SECRET
A. Purpose of Paper
This paper has been prepared to compare the results
of the 1967-68 interrogations of YURI NOSENKO with a CIA
paper dated February, 1968, entitled "The Examination of
the Bona Fides of a KGB Defector." This CIA paper was based
on previous interrogations of NOSENKO and concluded that
NOSENKO is not a bona fide defector
()
According to the paper, in arriving at this
conclusion the lengthy interrogations of NOSENKO, analysis
of KGB operations which he related and comparison of his
assertions with collateral information from other sources
were considered.
B. Background
(W)
For convenience in assessing these papers, the
following chronology of events is set forth:
(4)
NOSENKO first made contact with CIA in Geneva in
June, 1962. After several meetings he returned to Russia
and was not again in contact with CIA until his return to
Geneva in January, 1964. On his return to Geneva he indicated
(4)

TOP SECRET
NW 50953 DocId:32318825 Page 9
Significant Inaccuracies were detected in the CIA
paper regarding the KEYZERS, MORONE and ABIDIAN cases.
(0)
Contrary to statements in the paper, KEYZERS was not inter-
(5)(0)
viewed about homosexual activities before he left Moscow;
MORONE did have contact with a girl at American House posing
as a West German journalist; the Soviet maid TATYANA FEDOROVICH
did have access to ABIDIAN's living quarters within six months
after his arrival in Moscow.
COMMENT:
A number of previous CIA conclusions
regarding this period were based on deficient
interrogations of NOSENKO and inadequate
collateral inquiries. These conclusions have
been invalidated by current interrogation and
collateral inquiries and there is no substan-
tial basis for doubting NOSENKO's basic claims
regarding this period. (U)
F. 1962-64 Period (1)
It is concluded in the CIA paper that NOSENKO's
claims of being Chief of the American-British Commonwealth (4)
12
NW 50953 DocId:32318825 Page 10
HOP SEGRET
is alleged that NOSENKO did not indicate the sources from
which he obtained the information regarding the cases.
(4)
During current interrogation NOSENKO provided sources
or logical explanation for his knowledge in sixteen of the
nineteen cases referred to above. He also provided adequate
clarification regarding three of the other five cases which
were subjects of CIA criticism.
In addition a current review
of his notes by NOSENKO provided the translation "ECTOR",
(0)
previously obtained, as the
instead of "ACTOR" or "PROCTOR"
name of an agent. Collateral investigation has developed
a logical suspect by this name. (Logical suspects named
"ACTOR" or "PROCTORere
"PROCTOR' were not previously identified.)
COMMENT:
Previous interrogations of NOSENKO in
which information was not obtained regarding
the sources for these cases were obviously
inadequate. Current interrogations have
provided significant clarifying information
15

NW 50953 DocId:32318825 Page 11
I.
New Cases and New Information
The current interrogations of NOSENKO have developed
six new cases involving nine people which were previously not
uncovered during his interrogations. Collateral investigation
has identified six of these persons and one (DOMENICO CANALA) (U)
has been interviewed and admitted the allegations. This case
is considered significant corroboration of NOSENKO.
Additional significant data was developed on three
cases previously mentioned by NOSENKO. Data in one case (the
Brussels case) may assist in the identification of a KGB agent
who supplied NATO codes.
(4)
Considerable interesting, new and confirmatory data
was obtained during the current interrogations. Twelve examples
are cited/
COMMENT:
(4)
The new cases, new information and
confirmatory data obtained in the current inter-
rogations and collateral inquiries also clearly
establish that the previous interrogations were
deficient and collateral inquiries inadequate.
Failure to acknowledge significance of NOSENKO's
personnel identifications and organizational data
denotes lack of objectivity in CIA paper.

Appear reluctant in the past. One was his
extra-marital affair with a friend of INGA
KARLAMOVA and the other was his arrest in
1954 when he used a KGB cover document to
obtain treatment for venereal disease
As
a result he was removed as Komsomol Secretary.
In addition the "Characteristic" which was prepared
on him in early 1955 was critical of him and his
mother had interceded with PETR FEDOTOV, Chief
of SCD, who transferred NOSENKO to the 7th
Department. This intercession possibly prevented
his dismissal from KGB
**
2. Assignment Against Correspondent (4)
tages 76-80 relate to NOSENKO's assignment to
operations against American correspondents. It was stated
that although NOSENKO could give a breakdown of the network
of agents used against correspondents in terms of number and
type of agents, he had forgotten their true names and could
not provide personality information on any of them. (4)

necessary and they were suitable for use in a
case.)
NOSENKO had files on both of these agents
which he turned over to PHILLIP VASILYEVICH KISLITSYN
when NOSENKO began work on military attaches. He
had no opportunity to use "RAKETA" in 1953.
"RAKETA" was an agent for some officer of Section II,
1st Department in 1960 or 1961(4)
2. (Colonel EARL L. MICKELSON (U)
5.
On page 88 it is stated that Colonel EARL L.
(0)
MICKELSON was involved in at least two incidents inside
the Soviet Union which NOSENKO did not report.
COMMENT:
煅
During interrogation of NOSENKO he could not
(0)
recall specifically the arrest of MICKELSON but
stated that there were many "akts" against U. S.
military attache personnel in which they were
detained and written descriptions of their so-called
"violations" were prepared. He indicated that the
attache personnel, of course, in most instances
:
refused to sign such documents, but nevertheless nevertheless

they were prepared (1)
[TRA B. RICHARDS (1)
On pages 89 and 90 the paper indicates that NOSENKO
7(3) (0)
correctly identified IRA B. RICHARDS as an Assistant Army
Attache and named his maid MARIYA NEVEROVA as an agent reporting
on him. It was stated, however, that NOSENKO referred to
LUDMILA GROMAKOVA in connection with another matter as a
KGB agent during 1960-62 but did not relate her to RICHARDS (U)
or to the 1953-55 period. GROMAKOVA gave (RICHARDS Russian
language
(0)
lessons. It was also stated that NOSENKO did not
know of VOLODYA who was RICHARDS driver and therefore should
have been NOSENKO's agent..
ん
COMMENT:
啊
On December 11, 1967, (N-64), NOSENKO, in
response to a request, furnished a handwritten list
of his agents. For the period 1953-54 he listed as
an agent a teacher of the Russian language who was
giving lessons to correspondent CLARK. He also listed
for the period 1954-55 drivers of the military attache
(4)
:
and his officers, indicated there were five or six and

chambermaid NEFEDOVA against him as well as

drivers for the military attache's office. He
described the chambermaid and furnished her code
name as "SHEVEDOVA". When shown the name FEDEROVA
he indicated that this was the name of FELCHLIN'S
maid rather than NEFEDOVA. He also said that her
first name was probably MARIYA but recognized DORA
as the first name when it was mentioned to him. He
stated that a driver for the military attache office
was "SHNYREV" and accurately furnished his first name
as NIKOLAY. He said there were several "akts" on
(0)
FELCHLIN during his travel in the USSR which FELCHLIN (U
refused to sign. He recalled that FELCHLIN was
arrested with another officer while NOSENKO and his
wife were at Kubienka during the summer of 1954. He
said that this occurred on the 8th or 9th of the month,
probably July, and had appeared in the newspapers on
those dates. He stated that he had been on vacation
and his wife had given birth to a baby in August, 1954.
(Actually the arrest took place on July 4, or July 5,
1954, and may well not have appeared in the Soviet

NOSENKO also pointed out that KGB obtained
considerable information from microphones concerning
operations and plans of the Military Attache personnel
including their discussions before trips, their plans
for visiting various cities and points of interest
and their conversations after their trips. In addition
KGB knew how much money they had each year for
operations, the reactions of the officers to each
other, etc. Excerpts of information were given to
the Disinformation Department of KGB

Pages 95 and 96 deal with the expulsion from the
Soviet Union of Assistant U. S. Army Attaches BENSON, MULE
and STROUD This expulsion resulted from seizure of equipment
carried by these officers on May 5, 1955, and they were declared
personae non gratae. It was stated that NOSENKO claimed that
this incident had occurred after he was transferred to the
7th Department; however, when_the May 7 date was given to him

he had turned the 1st Section files over to
TOP SECRET
VALERIY BUDYLDIN who had worked for a short
period but was later fired from KGB and the
files were then transferred to VICTOR HERKASSADINK RASSADIN(4) (14)
It appears that NOSENKO's failure to recall
details of this incident could be due to his
hospitalization at the time it occurred.)

ment to strike up an acquaintance with VAN LAETHEM.ne LAETHEM. Sne

while NOSENKO was still the case officer responsible for
Army Attaches. He was reported to the Russians as an
Assistant Army Attache on permanent assignment although it
was actually a temporary assignment.
COMMENT:
As indicated above NOSENKO stated on
April 16, 1968, (N-181), that he was in the hospital
for 30 or 40 days just prior to transfer to the 7th
Department and would have been in the hospital during
April, 1955. When told that VAN LAETHEM returned to
the USSR on March 19, 1955, NOSENKO said that he did
not remember it.

On page 99 it is also indicated that if NOSENKO
served in the Embassy Section (1st Section, 1st Department)
during 1953-55, "It is difficult to perceive how he could
have remained unaware of 'ANDREY'S' identity." NOSENKO
claimed that "ANDREY" was spotted by ROY RHODES and was
recruited prior to NOSENKO's connection with KGB in. March,
1953.
"ANDREY" was a crypto-repairman and the direct
subordinate of the Army Attache cryptographic
