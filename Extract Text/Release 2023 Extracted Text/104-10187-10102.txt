1. DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY FURTHER DIRECT ACTION AGAINST NUICIO GONZALEZ
(SUCH AS "ACCIDENT" IN MEXICO AS SUGGESTED BY ERYTHROID ONE REF B) IS EITHER
FEASIBLE OR DESIRABLE. SINCE HIS STORY OF DETENTION, INTERROGATION, AND RECRUITMENT
ALREADY SURFACED IN MANAGUA PRESS, ANY FURTHER EFFORTS ON OUR PART AIMED TO
INTERFERE WITH HIS MOVEMENTS OR TO ATTEMPT COUNTER PUBLICITY WOULD MERELY KEEP HIS
CASE IN PUBLIC EYE AND POSSIBLY LEND CREDENCE TO HIS FANTASTIC (ALBEIT TRUE) STORY
AS PRINTED BY LA NOTICIA ON 8 OCTOBER IN MANAGUA. SINCE HE WAS NOT ARRESTED OPENLY
WITH OTHER NIC'S RECENTLY (NONE OF WHOM WERE INTERROGATED ON FRL BY "O" AND
CURRAN) AND MOREOVER WAS FREED UNCONDITIONALLY, EVEN HIS FRIENDS MAY NOT FULLY
BELIEVE DETAILS HIS ACCOUNT OF HOW HE WAS PITCHED BY NIC SECURITY SERVICE.

2. RECOMMEND MANA STATION ENDEAVOR CONVINCE GONZALEZ DELAY GRANTING (OR AT
