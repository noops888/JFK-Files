INITIALLY, THE INFLUX OF AMERICANS AND THEIR STATIONING IN THE
PROVINCES WAS WELCOMED, WITH THE THOUGHT THAT AMERICANS THUS
LOCATED WOULD COME TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFICULTIES CONFRONT ING
THE VIETNAMESE, THEREBY ENABLING THEM TO INTERPRET VIETNAMESE
PROBLEMS SYMPATHETICALLY AND WITH MORE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SITUATION.
THIS: HAS NOT PROVED TO BE THE CASE IN ALL INSTANCES.
3. PRESIDENT DIEM HAS RECEIVED A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF
COMPLAINTS AND STATEMENTS OF IRRITATION FROM HIS MILITARY AND
CIVILIAN CHIEFS ABOUT PROBLEMS OF RELATIONSHIPS WITH AMERICAN
COUNTERPARTS. AMONG OFFICIALS COMPLAINING WAS MAJOR GENERAL
TON THAT DINH, COMMANDING GENERAL, II CORPS, WHO COMMENTED THẬT
THERE WERE TOO MANY AMERICANS IN SOUTH VIETNAM.
COMPLAINTS HAVE
!
ALSO COME IN FROM THE JOINT GENERAL STAFF. NHƯ SAID THAT ONE
ADVANTAGE OF THE AMERICAN PRESENCE AT ALL ECHELONS WAS TO HELP
KEEP VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS HONEST AND TO STIMULATE THEM INTO
BETTER PERFORMANCE, AS VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS DID NOT WANT TO LOOK
BAD IN THE EYES OF FOREIGN OFFICERS. THE VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS
WERE. AT A DISADVANTAGE WITH RESPECT TO THEIR AMERICAN OPPOSITE
NUMBERS, BECAUSE THE AMERICANS CONTROLLED THE MEANS, Ι.Ε., THE
FUNDS AND GOODS, AND THIS CONTRIBUTED TO THE SENSE OF INADEQUACY
AND INFERIORITY ON THE PART OF VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS.
