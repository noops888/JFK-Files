CUBAN BUSINESSMAN (B), FROM AN AIRLINE EXECUTIVE (F) IN TOUCH WITH
COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY MEMBERS IN CUBA.
:
1. COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES IN CUBA HAVE PLANNED AN UPRISING TO TAKE PLACE
BETWEEN 30 AUGUST AND 2 SEPTEMBER 1962. THE FRENTE ANTICOMUNISTA DE
LIBERACION (FAL) HAS JOINED THE MOVIMIENTO REVOLUCIONARIO DEL PUEBLO (MRP)
IN THIS PLAN. VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE OLD CONSTITUTIONAL ARMY, THE REBEL
ARMY, AND THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MILITIA WILL JOIN IN THE UPRISING.
UNITED STATES PRESS SERVICES WILL BE ASKED TO GIVE FULL PUBLICITY TO THE
UPRISING AS SOON AS IT STARTS.
2. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FIDEL CASTRO HAS HAD TO BRING IN FOREIGN-
TROOPS BECAUSE OF THE CONFLICTS WHICH EXIST BETWEEN THE REBEL ARMY AND THE
MILITIA. MANY MEMBERS OF THE REBEL ARMY ARE DIS AFFECTED AND CONCERNED ABOUT
THE ARRIVAL OF SOVIET-BLOC TROOPS. THE ONLY REBEL ARMY UNIT WHICH, CAN BE

CONSIDERED FULLY IN SUFFORT OF THE GOVERNMENT OF CUBA IS DIVISION 50 OF
ORIENTS PROVINCE (B/FA). THIS DIVISION HAS 5,000 MEN, BUT EQUIPMENT FOR
10,000.
3. THERE ARE 300 MEN IN DIVISION 50 WHO WILL SUPPORT THE COUNTER-
REVOLUTIONARIES, BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT SUFFICIENT, THE COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES
INTEND TO PUBLISH THE EXACT POSITIONS OF ELEMENTS OF DIVISION 50 SO THAT
THESE UNITS MAY BE ATTACKED FROM THE AIR.
4. FIELD COMMENT: THE AIRLINE EXECUTIVE WHO REPORTED THE ABOVE
INPORNATION ALSO REPORTED THAT A GENERAL UPRISING IN ALL OF THE PROVINCES
OF CUBA WAS SCHEDULED FOR 4:00 A.M. ON 31 AUGUST 1962. THE AIRLINE EXECUTIVE
WAS TOLD BY NATIONAL COORDINATORS OF THE UNIDAD REVOLUCIONARIA (UR) IN CUBA
THAT DESPITE A REQUEST BY THE UR IN EXILE THAT THERE BE A DELAY IN THE DATE
FOR SUCH AN UPRISING, THE COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY MEMBERS IN CUBA ARE OF THE
OPINION THAT BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DELAY
THE DATE, PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF THE TIGHTENING OF SECURITY CONTROLS BY THE
24
GOVERNMENT OF CUBA. (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: AN OFFICIAL FRENCH SERVICE
PORTED THAT A MEMBER OF THE UR IN CUBA SAID ON 30 AUGUST THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
AN COFFICIAL
SERVICE) RF-
TO AVOID AN UPRISING AND EVEN LESS POSSIBLE FOR THE UR TO MAINTAIN CONTROL.)
5. FIELD COMMENT: A BONA FIDE POPULAR UPRISING DOES NOT APPEAR LIKELY
AT THIS TIME. INVESTIGATION OF THE REPORTS CONCERNING THE POSSIBLE UPRISING
LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE INFORMATION MAY BOT BE ACCURATE AND THAT
IT MAY REFLECT G-2 DECEPTION OR PROVOCATION. ALL INFORMATION ON THE
