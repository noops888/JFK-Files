MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Irving AMRON
1. Subject responded to the AEEXPLORE ad for a position as a
Russian language linguist. As was requested of him, he provided the
Forms 444, 89, autobiography, and photograph.
2. he undersigned established contact with Subject by phone on
2 September and arrangements were made to interview him on the following
day. He vas interviewed in the Undersigned's Philadelphia hotel room
on 3 September 1964.
3. The following was obtained from AMRON during the interview:
&. Subject, of Jewish descent, was born in 1917 in the USA.
Subject's father, whose original name had been
Philip AMRONIM
came to the USA in 1905/06 at the age of approximately 15. Philip
AMRONTM's parents stemmed from the GONEL ares. At the tine of his
emigration to the USA, he was accompanied by his mother (his father
died sometime prior thereto), and by the following brothers and sisters:
Lewis, Willy, Abe (who has since died), Moris, Minnie (now married
to LAIKEN), Pearl, and Max. All of Subject's father's brothers
except for Max, are butchers by occupation, including Subject's
father. Max graduated from CCIHY and became a structural engineer;
he has an office on 43rd Street and his firm is called the Amron
Associates.
b. Subject's mother, also of Jewish descent, came to the USA
in 1911 (or 1913). Her older sister, Fannie, is married to (fnu)
COHEN who is presently retired and living in Florida. Her sister,
Ruth, married Max AMRON. Her brother, Hyman HORLIK, who arrived
in the USA only in 1962, owns a liquor store in Bayonne, New Jersey.
Subject's mother has another sister (nu) who is presently living in
Florida. Subject's mother has one brother who is still living in
the USSR.

c. At the time of Subject's birth, Subject's father vas
employed in the Brooklyn shipyards. However, he changed jobs
frequently and was subsequently employed on a farm near New
Brunswick, then in a shoe factory as a cutter, then as a butcher,
and finally became active in a Jewish cocperative organization.
As Subject's father became convinced that the future of the Jews
vas in Russia under Soviet Communism, in 1931 Subject's family
left the USA for the USSR for Birobidzhan where Subject's father
worked as an agronomist (he had sometime prior thereto graduated
from the National Farm School in Bucks County, Pennsylvania).
d. According to Subject, his family returned to the USA
in 1933; the motivating reason therefor was the ill health--
actually only sme headaches--of Cubject's brother, Eugene.
Subject alleges that, because they had retained their US citizen-
ship, they experienced no problems either in leaving the USSR or
in obtaining permission to return to the USA. Moreover, Subject's
father allegedly did not like life in the USSR; however, Subject's
mother and sister insisted that they return to the USSR after
only a brief stay in the USA.
e. As a result, later in 1933 the entire AMRON family once
again returned to the USSR. Again, Subjec. states that they had no
problems in obtaining authorization from the Soviet government
for this trip to the USSR. Upon their return to the USSR, they
established themselves in Moscow where one Noah LONDON, a friend
of the family and a construction engineer, took Subject's father
"into his employ". Subject's father worked in this capacity, in
the construction industry, from 1933 to 1936. Sometime after the
1936 purges began, Subject's father worked for Komsomolsk, a Moscov
"panel board construction" outfit. In 1936 Subject's father also
worked for the Paris Commune as a shoemaker. Subject's mother
worked during this entire period as chief of a dining establishment
in the school of foreign languages in Moscow.
f. Subject began his elementary education at the DeWitt Cliaton
School in the USA where he studied until 1931; he then studied in
the Soviet secondary school in Khabarovsk, Birobidzhan, until 1933.
In 1933 he again returned for one semester to the Dewitt Clinton
School. Later in 1933 and 1934 be attended the Anglo-American School
in Moscow where he completed his 8th grade of school. He then
continued his studies from 1933 to 1936 in Public School #327 in the 24th
Bauman Rayon. In 1936 he entered the Moscow Avtodorozhniy Institut
where he studied on the civil engineering faculty, to be a highway
engineer. He graduated in 1941 at which time he was sent to assist

in the construction of an airdrome in Minsk, latfer to the Polish
station of Janow.
g. In 1937 Subject's mother was dismissed from her position
and both she and Subject's father began to feel the pressure of the
purges. Subject's father, allegedly by appealing to the then President
KALIMIN, succeeded in again acquiring exit visas for them to the
USA. Subject, who admits that he had become a "good Communist" ty
then had gotton thoroughly steeped" in the Communist philosophy,
elected to remain behind in the USSR. An important consideration,
he states, vas his desire to complete his education which he vas
certain he would not be able to do in the USA for economic reasons.
h. According to Subject, his father never lost his American
citizenship. Subject's mother, however, in 1936 applied for and
obtained Soviet citizenship. nccordingt, ha actually
sonpired Soviet citizenship "by default" although he never applied
ar this in person; he alleges that although he was 18 years of age
albe tine, he was "granted" Soviet citizenship by virtue of his
boler's application for her own citizenship.
1. Subject remained in Moscow prior to World War II. In April
1940 he married
Nina MOISEYIVA
a bookkeeper by profession,
who was the step-daughter of the well-known Major SEOGOLEV of the
"Soviet Proleteriat Regirent". A son was born to them in June 1941.
Although at this time Subject was assigned to the construction of
aerodromes to support front line troops, he succeeded in pulling
strings and in arranging a DY triy" to Moscow, ostensibly to visit
the Geodetic Institute. Earcute back from Moscow to the front lines,
Subject's train got bombed in Brest Litovsk on 22 June 1941 and as
a result he was returned to Moscow on the same train via Baranovichi.
According to Subject, he was then assigned to the Moscow Military
District, to the Otdel Aerodromnoi Sluzhby, where he was placed in
charge of a brigade of engineers, technicians and laborers who were
engaged in building dumy air sites for camouflage purposes.
J. In August 1941 Subject states that he was permitted to return
to school in order to receive his diploma which was granted him in
October 1941. He was then assigned to the 22nd Voyenno-Dorozhaiy
Otryad which was formed in Dmitrov but which was then assigned to
Suzdal'. Subject states that he was not inducted into the Soviet
military service allegedly because "engineers were needed" and
SECRET
14-00000
SECRET

because, as a member of the MD, this was considered as equivalent
to military service. Nonetheless, in response to my query, Subject
admitted that this was unusual as his activities were a kind which
vere performed by old voren particularly since during this period,
from October 1941 to September 1942, all able-bodied Soviet males
were drafted into the Soviet army. During this period Subject lived
in comparative ease, being assigned to Suzdal and Klin, and other
towns. According to Subject, be wore an Mid uniform but vore no
insignia. He admitted that "favored treatment" was bestowed upon
him and his family when the MD assisted him in evacuating his first
wife and son from Moscow in August 1941 to beyond the Urals. (His
son by his first wife reportedly died on 11 October 1943 of diabetes.)
k. In September 1942, Subject received an appcintzent to the
Moscow 2nd Military Infantry Institute from which he graduated in June
1013
which be the grate of Iria e Soviet
Infantry. In response to my query, Subject again admitted that this
appointment was highly unusual as his background did not lend itself
to this, as appointzents were made out of the various military
branches, and as this implied that, as a foreigner (American), he vas
fully and completel trusted by the Soviet punitive organs who had
cleared him both for this training and the institute and for promotion
to officer status in the Soviet Army.
1
1. Initially he was sent to Alatev on the Volga, then to Orel
where ise vas assigned to the front lines in August 1943. He was given a
platoon of infantry troops in the 415th Infantry Division of the
Soviet Central Front. However, in October 1943 he was wounded; he was
hit in the left forehead by e German bullet. Ee was operated on in
a field hospital and then transferred to a Moscow hospital after he
had recovered sufficiently. He was reclassified after his recovery
and found suitable to continue in military service with the limitation
that he should not serve on the front lines (goden vtoroi stepeni).
n. Because the wound failed to heal completely (he has a very
obvious scar, with approximately a 1" depression, on his forehead),
he "asked" to be assigned to a warmer clizate. The Soviet authorities,
he states, complied and in January 1944 dispatched him to Tbilisi
where he was placed in a special officer's camp; he was hospitalized
again, tad osteomyelitis complications, and ultimately discharged from
the Soviet military forces. Eowever, Subject provided several
contradictory stories as to the date of discharge which at various
times be indicated occurred in May 1944, then in July 194, and even
in August 1944. (NOTE: This aspect of Subject's story bothered hir
as it was obvious to the undersigned that Subject had somewhere become
confused in this aspect of his background.)
:

n. Upon his discharge, he was returned to the Moscow area where
he was placed in a rest hoc (although Subject admitted that there
really existed no need for this as he had recovered already prior
to his discharge). In continuing his narration, Subject indicated
that the rest of his story "sounds very strange and unbelievable"
but then averred that it was true. He states that, strange as it
appears and despite the shortage of Soviet nen at the time (1944)
he could not "find" himself a job. He went to the MVD which did
offer hin a job in Veliki Laki on the highways with the ScyuzDorog-
Proyekt; however, he was not given the job by the officials
responsible for this. As a result, he appealed directly to the
Kinister of the MVD who "tried to intercede in Subject's behalf.
Allegedly after he was given a full physical examination, be vas told
that he could not be assigned to the highway units for reasons
which were not speise out to smject.
o. Subject then "sought out" work with the Nauchniy Sovet with
no luck. Ee ultimately chtained a job with the Moscow Sovet in the
Moscow Soviet Senior Library (sic). in November 1944, at a salary
of 900 rubles, Subject began working in the field of "information
on municipal works-highway construction, architecture, sanitation,
etc." Fis inmediate supervisor vas (au) LIFEEDEV, the head of
information department of the Pydro-Energy Project. Subject admitted,
in reply to the undersigned's query, that his work vas "unusuai"
for several reasons. First, he was paid a salary which was unusually.
high and out of line with his qualifications. Secondly, though
paid a salary for a full-time job and position, he actuzily worked o
a part-time basis and was able to come and go almost as he vished.
His work also included working on abstracts and translations from
English to Russian, primarily in the field of dams, dam construction,
and hydraulics.
:
p. In June 1949 Subject states that be vas dismissed from the
foregoing position after he was given the explanation that the flow of
literature from the USA, which Subject was translating, had decreased.
In actual fact, Subject states, he was being "purged" because he vas
a Jev. Ee then found a job as a laboratory assistant in a concrete
plant where he worked from July 1949 to 23 February 1950. Because
he did not like that job, Subject states he wrote to Stalin personally
as a result of which, within less than 4 weeks, he was offered 4-5
different jobs. The positicas vere offered to him by the Moscow
Committee of the CP to whom "Stalin had forvarded the letter". In
reply to my query, Subject admitted that he was not concerned that,
by writing to Stalin, be would come to the attention of the Soviet
punitive organs, MVD/MCB, which would undertake to investigate his
case. Accordingly, on 1 April 1950 Subject was given a job as an
SECTET

SOMET

engineer with the Bezman District Road Department where he worked
until February 1955.
q. After he lost his job in 1949 with the Moscow Sovet, he states
that his relations with his wife went from bad to worse and ultimately
cultinated first in a separation and latter in a divorce in 1950. I
the meantime, he was already living with
Eugenia VOLSOVA
an empolyee and a teacher of forsenic medicine of the Moscow Medical
Institute where she was studying for her PhD and where she was
a = 25 3 pathologist
med her ether in
1950 or 1951. However, within less than one month of their carriage,
Subject divorced her as he found out that she vas a "tad person" and
because he "had falien blindly in love" with her. (50: This aspect
of Subject's story disturbed tia very much. He was wasure of tinsel,
wes vegue on dates, details, specifics, cames, etc. It was again
obvious that Subject was less than frank and open about this aspect
of his beckground. As narratica did not sound convincing to Subject
hinsche when he began talking about "falling blindly in Love", etc.)
In 1952 he began living with another woman,
Pose MINKINA,
whom he married only in late 1954 when their son was already vell on
the way. MINKINA's parents and family were very strongly opposed to
the marriage because the parents held responsible party positions and
because MINKIKA's brother held a sensitive position with the Soviet
electronics and aviation industries. A son vas born to Subject and
MINKINA on 5 April 1955.
r. In ca 1954 (dates vague) Subject entered the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism and continued his studies for three or more years.
Though he registered for the evening sessions, he devcted a good
portion of his days to study. As a result, Subject again admitted
to the undersigned that he actually was in a unique position of bein
able to do alrost as be "wished and desired" although ostensibly be
was a full-time employee of the Bauman District Road Department. While
a student at the Institute of Marxist-Leninism, Subject and his wife
began submitting applications for a visa to visit Subject's parents
in the USA. In actual fact, Subject states, his real purpose in
applying for the visa vas to "defect" upon his arrival in the USA.
In February 1955 Subject states that be was fired" from his job
with the Bauman District because of "political unreliability". Bovever,
Subject admitted to the undersigned that the real reason for dismissal
SOMET
14-00000
SECRET
-7-
must have been otherwise as, had he actually been dismissed for
"political unreliability", he would not have been able to continue
his studies at the Institute of Marxism-Leninism.
s. Because Subject had commicated to his father, using
"hidden phrases" in their letters to each other, about his wish to
leave the USER, Subject's father arrived in the USSR in 1957 in
order, Subject states, "to establish at first hand for hizsel"
whether Subject really wished to "defect to the USA". Subject's
father remained in the USSR for a total of 10 days. As a result
of his father's visit, Subject changed his tactics and began to
submit applications for "imigration" to the USA. As earlier, these
כימי סכל כ ::octod;
et states عية أصلا
continued resubmitting then several times each year.
t. After be left the Bauman District place of employment in
February 1955, Subject found work as a "free lance translator for
the Moscow Torgovaya Palata. He earned ca 100 rubles per south
translating English language caterial related to the iron and steel
plant which was being designed by the USSR for erection in India.
In January 1956 Subject found work as chief of the translations
bureau of the Nauchno-Issledov.elriv Institut Ministerstva Mashiro
Stroyeniya; his functions consisted prearily of supervising the
translation of English language sanruals on technical equitment.
Again, Subject admitted that his work was "umsual" as, in actual
fact, he spent 1-2 days at work, spent the rest of his time at hose,
and devoted most of his time and energy to the studies at the
Institute of Marxism-Leninism. Sis salary continued at 1100 rubles
per month.
منا
u. In August 1958 his work came to an end. Generally he
provided a contardictory account in this respect. Initially he
stated that the position had been eliminated but then changed this
story to state that he resigned in August 1956 as he vould have had
to begla devoting his full tize to the work. In any case, his
resignation generally coincided with his completion of studies at
the Institute of Varrisn-Leninisa. Thereafter, and until his
inmigration to the USA in 1962, Sabject held no full tire job.
Konetheless, he states that he succeeded in earning no less than
about 1100 rubles per nouth by working as a free lance translator
for the Torgovaya Palata of Moscow. Ee turned over to the undersigned
a sample of his translation efforts-see the attached book. In
response to. my query, Subject admitted that his work again vas of
such a nature that he was a free agent, came and went as he pleased,
and generally vas responsible to no one. Apparently in order to
SECTET
14-00000
SEORET
-8-
forestall any further discussions in this regard, Sur Ject then
stated that "if you are thinking that I cold have worked for the
KGB et this time, then you are right because I had the tire to
do anything including engaging in intelligence activities'.
Eowever, Subject then proceeded to deny that he had then or at any
time, tad any relationship with the KGB (or its predecessor
organizations).
v. In July 1962 Subject's mother and father came to Moscow,
this specifically for the purpose of getting Subject to return to
the USA. They stayed in Moscow fow enger time the
Pother acte letters to KEPISEY, to Nina PERUSECEVA, to ADZAUWEI,
to the Supreme Soviet, to the 13, and to other Soviet establish-
ments in order to get Subject and his son permission for enteration
to the USA. (Subject's wife, MININA, had died in 1961.) In August
1962, while vacationing in Sochi Subject ves sought out by the
local Inturist office and epprised by the local militis office that,
"in view of your father's strong appeals", the USSR had granted
Subject and his son permission to leave the WEER. Upon his return to
Moscow, Subject proceeded to the American Ezbassy where he vas
advised that he had not been granted an exit visa by the Soviets.
As a result, Subject applied for izigretion to the USA twice, once
in the capacity of a Soviet citizen using his Soviet passport, and
the second time in the capacity of an "American citizca".
w. In September 1962 the application to travel to the USA
as an "izmigrant" was approved for him and his son.
vithout waiting to receive approval to travel inder his claix of
Therefore,
being an "American citizen", Subject left the SSR and entered the
USA on his Soviet passport together with his son on 24 September
1962 via Idlewild. Upon his arrival in the SA, Subject imediately
undertook action to have his "American citizenship" restored. This
was initially denied as he had admitted that he had voted in the
Soviet national elections. However, be then retained an attorney
vto appealed the case; the original decision was then reversed and
both Subject and his son had their IS citizenship restored to then
in the sumer of 1963, the reversal was based on Subject's clain
that be bad had no choice and vas, therefore, compelled to vote in
the USSR national elections.
x. Upon his arrival in the SA, Subject immediately applied
for a position with the in, however, he was rejected as he was "state-
less" at the time. He then accepted a position with Stelling, Lori-
Wood, and "sin Suetendals, 36th Street, working on site-planning.
His superviser, one Frank McGowan, then recommended Subject to the
SECRET
14-00000
SECRET

Blauvelt engineering firm for whom he worked from January 1963
through July 1964. In 1904 Subject found work with Farold J.
SALDEN, 60 Broad Street, Red Bank, Sew Jersey, as an engineer
working on the planning and designing of sub-divisions, grading,
construction developments, etc. Ris immediate superviser is the
township er vineer of Marlboro Township, New Jersey. Els present
salary is $100.00 per month.
y. In April 1963 Subject married
Bella MINCBERG nee MILSTEIN
a Polish Jew who had come to the LEA from Poland in 1949. She has
come har martens age(s) Subject and his son nov live
in the home of his present wife.
4. Comments and Assessment:
a. Subject speaks native English and passes for a middle class
American. Eis Russian is likewise native.
b. According to Subject, his objective in life Low is to work
for the US Government. Ee states that he has submitted Forms 57 to
a number of the US Government agencies (he did not elaborate). in
applying for the position under AIR, Subject asked for $10,000.00
per annum which is his asking price for a position with the US Goverment.
c. According to Subject, his present position is excellent with
great potential for going into partnership as soon as he becomes a
licensed engineer. However, he states that he is not interested in
making money (despite his request for a $10,000.00 salary) but in Tight-
ing Communisa" as an employee of the US Covernment.
d. Subject adritted that he was a firm and strong believer of
Corsumiss which, incidentaliy, was the reason why he remained behind
in the USSR when his parents returned to the IEA in 1937. Ee states
that he continued to be a firm believer of Commisz until approxinstely
1958/59 when he became "disenchanted with Communism". Subject
denies that he was a menber of the Komsomol or that he had to join the
Communist Party, this despite the fact that he became an officer of
the Soviet Army and despite the fact that he was accepted to staty
at the Institute of Marxism-Leninist. Despite his alleged "disenchant-
ment" with Communism, Subject spoke in flattering terms about life
in the USSR, about the "democracy", about equal opportunities, about
the excellent "educational systes, et cetera. Subject aimitted that
SECRET
14-00000
SECRET
-10-
he had led almost a "charming existence" in the 1EER and that
neither life in the USSR nor the Soviet authorities ristreated him.
e. According to Subject, be vas never arrested in the Soviet
Union.
f. In reply to my query, Subject indicated that in 1958 the
KGB tried to co-opt bin into reportinga fellow student at the
Institute of Marxism-Leninism. Sovever, Subject states that he
rejectd the pitch. In reply to various queries which vere posed
to him about the fellow-student (name allegedly nov forgotton),
Subject states that he dič render an unfavorable report on the person.
Despite this, the particular Soviet was nitizerely assigned ebroed
es an interpreter. Subject later heard that the Soviet worked and
traveied both Japan ani Itary.
g. In reply to a general query about life in the USSR, Subject
indicated that life in the USER has made him into "an accomplished pre-
varicator".
h. Subject was less than fluent in relating the story of his
life to the undersigned. ñe made mistakes frepeatly, be contra-
dicted himself, be altered dates to accomodate other aspects of
is activities to correspond with shat he had mentioned earlier, etc.
Also, Subject repeatedly tried to digress from relating his story
into presenting his views of life; it was a chcre to keep hơn on
substantive matters relating to his om backgrund.
i. Subject's brother, Eugene, is now exployed as an engineer
of the Freehell Township, New Jersey. Additionally, he has a
private office in Rockland, New Jersey, called the Civil Engineer
Associates.
j. Subject's account of how he acquired Soviet citizenship--
see above- 15 & very veal item in Subject's scry. He will have
us believe that be got Soviet citizenship by default" as a result
of his mother's application for Scriet citizenship for herself.
he kinself admitted to the undersigned that this is illogical as
his brother, Sugene, whose status vas no different from Subject's,
never acquired Soviet citizenship by default" though Subject did
allegedly without any action whatever on his own part. Moreover,
Sabject adnitted that he was legally of age (15) by this time and
no longer a dependent as a result of which he would have had to apply
for a Soviet passport and for Soviet citizenship of his own free
volition rather than through his mother.
SEONET

k. Subject is aware that the story of his "imigration" to
the USA is also weak. Ee tried to explain this away by stating that
be "got cut by mistake", that he was permitted to go to hide the
Soviet shame surrounding the Cuban crisis", that "someone had
committed an error", etc. Ee admitted that there exists no other
explanatica as to why the Soviet goverment vould have permitted
him to leave the USSR as, in the eyes of the Soviet goverment, be
ves a full fledged and responsible Soviet citizer who had no
genuine or legitimate clain to American citizenship. As a result,
Subject is usually sensitive to this topic.
5. CONCLUSION:
a. In the opinion of the undersigned, Subject should not be
considered for either ARSCREEN or AΞEXPLORE despite the fact both
his English and Russian are native.
b. On the basis of the interview, the undersigned feels that,
Subject is less than frank and that be is prevaricating. Moreover,
there exist imwerable items in Subject's tale which are indicative
both that he worked as a recruited agent of the KGB (and its
predecessor organizations, in the 11 and that he left the Kar caly
through and with the intercession of the KGB.
c. It should be underscord that because of the unique and sensitive
cover used by the undersigned, to attempt was made to resolve the various
contradictions, to challenge Subject on any of his statements, or to
pursue certain points of their logical conclusion. The foregoing vas
obtained in the form of an interview and no real attempt could be made,
given the cover, to delve nore deeply into the suspicious aspects of
Subject's background.

11. GIVE PARTICULARS CONCERNING PREVIOUS NATIONALITY. Haile I was living in Moscow, the
Russian government considered me as a Russian citizen, even though I
had never handed in an application for Soviet citizenship. Due to this,
and because I was in a rush to leave the country, I arrived xxx on a
Soviet foreign passport. In the U. S. Embassy in Moscow I filled in si-
zultaneously two applications for entry into the U. S. A. : one as an
inzigrant and the other as an American citizen. I received a Jonquota
-2(1) visa dated Sptexter 10, 1952. After arrival the Board of Appeals
of the Dept. of State reinstated my native-born citizenship.
