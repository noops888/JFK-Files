By Top Secret" communication dated August 30, 1955,
the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) advised that the subject
was soheduled to depart for the United States on August 30, 1955,
from the Philippine Islands as one of a group of twelve
Philippine labor leaders who will undergo labor training under
the sponsorship of the International Cooperation Administration
(ICA). Esguerra will remain in this country for approximately
six months. According to CIA, The has been utilized by a branch
of the Philippine Intelligence Service with whom CIA maintains
a close liaison relationship as a penetration agent into the
4. Philippine Communist Party (PKP). Although the subject has not
yet been recruited by the PKP, he already has been given several
missions by a Philippine Communist leader. Since he has not yet
been recruited into the organization, the CIA does not feel that
he will be given important contacts to make in the United States.
CIA advised that in the event the subject makes contacts with
individuals of interest while in this country, he has been
furnished with a Post Office box number in New York City which
will be serviced by CIA to which the subject can address
correspondence. Esguerra is unaware of U.S. interest in this
matter and is unaware that the box will be serviced by repre-
sentatives of the U.S. Government. He has been forewarned that
in the event he is contacted by Communists he may be placed in
touch with representatives of the U.S. Government, probably the
FBIS)(U)
On September 6, 1955, Mrs. Jane Roman of the CIA
advised the Liaison Agent that the subject had departed from the
Philippine Islands as scheduled. Shortly prior to his departure,
The advised a Philippine Intelligence Service contact that a
Communist official had given him a list of individuals whom he
should endeavor to contact while in the United States. The
subject was not in a position to provide the complete list and
