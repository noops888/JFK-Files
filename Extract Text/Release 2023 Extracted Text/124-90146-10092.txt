AFRICAN REVOLUTION
T-1, a confidential source abroad, has advised
that the publication "African Revolution" was created by the
Algerian Front of National Liberation. Its English language
edition is published in Switzerland. There have been several
changes in the editorial composition and policy of "African
Revolution" recently, according to T-1. Following a dis-
agreement with BEN BELLA, JACQUES CAMILLE VERGES, the
editor of the publication, was dismissed from his functions.
VERGES is an Algerian national who was born March 5, 1925.
His place as editor was taken by MOHAMED HARBI, former
Secretary General of the Algerian Ministry of Foreign
Affairs. Since HARBI became editor, the editorial policy
has changed and the June, 1963, issue of "African Revolution"
indicated that the journal is now closely reflecting BEN
BELLA's policy and attempting to promote a more Algerian
image. (0)
Although VERGES is no longer connected with the
Algerian venture, he continues to publish the English digest
of "African Revolution" from Lausanne, Switzerland. The
July, 1963, issue was retitled "Africa, Latin America, Asia
Revolution." The phrase "the third world," which is now in
vogue among VERGES's group to describe the underdeveloped
nations of Africa, South America and Asia, indicates the
scope of the magazine in its new form. T-1 described this
publication with which VERGES is presently connected as pro-
communist.U
Two members of the Lausanne office of the "African
Revolution" have remained loyal to VERGES after he was
replaced by HARBI. They are FREDY GILBERT NILS ANDERSSON,
a Swedish national who was born on February 14, 1933, in
Lausanne, and RICHARD THOMAS GIBSON, a United States citizen
who was born May 13, 1931, in Los Angeles.

ANDERSSON apparently heads the office of the
Lausanne edition of "African Revolution" with offices at
10-11 Metropole, Lausanne. He is also editor-secretary of
"Societe Cooperative Clartee Editions. "C
GIBSON has V. S. Passport No. B-131994 which was
issued at Washington, D. C. on Ja January 25, 1961. His wife
is JOY MARJORIE GIBSON, nee KAYE, who was born July 12, 1926,
in London. She is a British subject, carries British pass-
port C156546, and is also a journalist. She resides in
Lausanne at 17 Escaliers du Marche, where she arrived from
Algeria in late April 1963 (this also is presumably the
residence of her husband, RICHARD THOMAS GIBSON)

According to T-1, VERGES has been denied permission
to enter Switzerland. The case against ANDERSSON is still
pending (probably relating to whether or not he will be
allowed to remain in Switzerland). RICHARD THOMAS GIBSON
has been refused a Swiss resident's permit and has been
ordered to depart from Switzerland before December 15, 1963
