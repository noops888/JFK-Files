1. A former KARK officer recently revorted that an American
exchange student in Helsinki named for LOHMATELY has said that he
became acquainted in Helsinki with Im FCLOB, Counsellor of the
Soviet mbassy. According to [LOHVATE he and CO became fairly

the United States, Ob

2. Headquarters has no record of NLCB (OCA) serving
in Finland, although there are de relatively low-berel people
with names such as LIMEY, co, and CLUB5V. The Soviet
Counsellors in Helsinki are Serrel Timonovich TOTOV and Mikhail
Grigoryevich KOTOV. The name, is possibly a phonetic garble
of KOTCV. If so, the indications vo Kave that KOTOV is RIS leads
us to doubt that his spathy for the United States would be genuine.

3. Jane P. Kichline has told us that a month or two ago the
Assistant POA in Helkind told the Station about a Fulbright student
who was evidently "bein cultivated by a Soviet official. On the
basis of pararapes 1d above, we believe it would be worthwhile
for Pendleton to try to kenties fou LOHWATER Who may be identical
with the albright stepent mentioned by the Assistant POA. The
identity of the Soviet official is, of course, also of interest.
Headquarters has no identifiable traces on LOMATER
