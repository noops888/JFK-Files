IT IS NOTED THAT DGI WAS RENAMED IC DURING EARLY DECEMBER, 1976.
VASQUEZ IS A LONG-ESTABLISHED SOURCE AND PERSONAL FRIEND OF LEGAT.
ADDITIONALLY, VASQUEZ HAS BEEN AN EXTREMELY CLOSE PERSONAL FRIEND,
ADVISOR AND CONFIDANT TO GENERAL ER NESTO BAEZA MICHAEL SEN, THE
DIRECTOR OF IC. IC.
JAIME VASQUEZ WAS EXTREMELY UPSET AND DEJECTED OVER A RECENT OFFICIAL
SANCTION AGAINST HIM WHICH INCLUDED A TEN DAY SENTENCE WHICH CONFINED
HIM TO IC HEAD QUARTERS, REMOVAL FROM HIS POSITION AS INTERPOL DIRECTOR
AND A TRANSFER FROM SANTIAGO TO AN IC RESIDENT AGENCY IN PUERTO MONT,
A REMOTE SOUTHERN AREA OF CHILE.
VASQUEZ EXPLAINED THAT DURING THE LAST WEEK OF SEPTEMBER, 1976,
A SERIES OF ACCUSATIONS WERE MADE BY THE NUMBER TWO MAN IN IC CON-
CERN ING ALLEGED MISCO ND UCT BY VASQUEZ TO GENERAL BAEZA. VASQUEZ
ADVISED THAT FOUR OF THE ACCUSATIONS MADE AGAINST HIM WER ABSURD
AND HE WAS ABLE TO DEFEND HIMSELF SUCCESSFULLY. VASQUEZ NOTED THAT
FOUR OF THE ACCUSQTIONS HAD TO DO WITH HIS ALLEGED RECEIPT OF AN
AUTOMOBILE FROM A NARCOTICS TRAFFICKER AND OTHER FINANCIAL IRREGU

CRIMINALS ACTIVE IN THE NARCOTICS FIELD
LEGAT BELIEVES THAT CIA'S INFORMATION INDICATING THAT IC WAS
PROHIBITED BY PRESIDENT PINO CHET FROM DISCUSSING BOSCH'S CASE WITH
ANY AMERICANS MORE THAN LIKELY REFERS TO VASQUEZ'S REMOVAL FROM
SANTIAGO BY TRANSFERRING VASQUEZ, THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVELY
HAS GUARANTEED THAT THE BOSCH INVESTIGATION WOULD NOT BE DISCUSSED
WITH U. S. OFFICERS, SINCE ONLY VASQUEZ, GENERAL BAEZA AND THE DINA
IRECTOR HAD A COMPLETE PICTURE AS TO IC'S INVESTIGATION OF BOSCH.
THE IC OFFICIAL REPLACING VASQUEZ HAS VIRTUALLY NO KNOWLEDGE OF REQUEST
MADE TO IC CONCERNING CUBAN EXILE ACTIVITIES AND ACCORDING TO VASQUEZ,
THIS IC OFFICER IS COMPLETELY IGNORANT AS TO BOSCH'S ACTIVITIES IN
CHILE, SINCE VASQUEZ TRANSMITTED THIS INFORMATION DIRECTLY TO GENERAL
BAEZA.
AGAIN, AS PREVIOUSLY NOTED BY THE BUENOS AIRES OFFICE,
BOSCH'S ACTIVITIES IN CHILE DURING 1975 ARE OBVIOUSLY EXTREMELY
EMBARRASSING TO THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT AND THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT
IS EXTREMELY RELUCTANT AND WILL BE ADAMANT IN DISCLOSING ANY CONNEC-
TIONS BY BOSCH-WITH ANY CHILEAN GOVERNMENT ENTITY. WHETHER OR NOT
