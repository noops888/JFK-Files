Chief, Western Hemisphere Division
Termination of Project KDAFGHAN
1. Project KDAFGHAN, approved for FY 72 and FY 73 in the
amount of $11,950 each year, covered Mexico City Station's
observation post targetted against the Cuban Embassy and
Consulate in Mexico. OP operators KDAFGHAN-1 and his depen-
dent mother KDAFGHAN-2, Cuban exiles resident in Mexico since
1960, were the only human assets in the project.
2. As a result of the JMYAK damage assessment and other
security considerations it was decided that the project should
be terminated and the agents resettled in another country.
DIRECTOR 285255 amended the project for FY 72 to a total of
$20,950 to provide for the termination and resettlement of the
agents. The agents were terminated in August 72 and are now
being resettled in Spain. DIRECTOR 300167 concurred in
terminating the project as of 31 August 72.
3. In view of the developments in paragraph 2, above,
WH/PI recommends approval of this termination request.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division
SUBJECT
: Project KDAFGHAN Termination
1. A request for termination action is contained in
paragraph four, herein.
2. Project KDAFGHAN is a support project which provides
the Mexico City Station with fixed photographic and physical
surveillance of the Cuban Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City.
The objectives of the project are to furnish photographic cov-
erage of the Cuban installation during daylight hours, to
assist the Station in compiling dossiers on officials of the
installation, and to fulfill various requirements in support
of other Station Cuban operations. The KDAFGHAN project en-
compasses two assets, KDAFGHAN-1 and KDAFGHAN-2, who have been
associated with the project since 1962.
3. While this project may be of some value to the FBI
(FBI compares KDAFGHAN photographs with the photographs of
known leaders of extremist groups in the U.S. as well as with
photographs of persons who are subjects of identification
orders prepared on badly wanted fugitives in the U.S.), it is
of little value, as presently constituted, to Mexico City
Station. There are other means of obtaining photographs of
PCS and TDY Cuban personnel.
4. In early 1972 the Station mounted a thorough CI review
of all Cuban operations in an attempt to improve their overall
security. Although KDAFGHAN-1 passed the SGSWIRL with no
apparent deception, his Cuban exile status, the long period
of time he has been operating his OP site in close proximity
to the Cuban Embassy, and the potential (perhaps immediate)
danger presented by his and KDAFGHAN-2's Cuban relatives made

it clear that the agents should be terminated. In view of the
aforementioned, as well as security considerations in the JMYAK
case, WH/1 requests approval to terminate this project effec-
tive 31 July 1972. In order to meet termination commitments
project KDAFGHAN was amended on 30 June 1972 by DIRECTOR 285255
in the amount of $9,000, increasing the project's authorization
from $11,950 to $20,950 for FY 1972. KDAFGHAN-1 and KDAFGHAN-2
were terminated on 1 August 1972. There were no security inci-
dents during the termination.

Purpose:
The LIONION Project provides the Mexico City Station
with fixed, selective photographic and physical surveillance
of the Cuban Embassy and Cuban Consulate in Mexico City.
It
is designed to provide information in support of Priority A,
paragraphs 2 and 4 of the current Operating Directive, that
is, the Cuban target present in Mexico and the support
rendered by Cubans in Mexico to exile and other leftist
groups in Mexico.
Description:
1. The LIONION Project currently encompasses two agents,
LIONION/1 and LIONION/2, a basehouse directly across from the
Cuban compound, and a safehouse for meetings with Station Case
Officers. The two agents furnish photographic coverage during
daylight hours of the main entrance to the Cuban Embassy.
In
addition, on a spot basis, photographic coverage and visual
surveillance of the Cuban Consulate entrance is possible.
agents also act as dispatchers for the unilateral LIEMBRACE
surveillance team when the LIEMBRACE team is being used
against Cuban target individuals. A description of the
individual assets is set forth below.
The
2. LIONION/1 (201-288248): A Cuban lawyer in exile in
Mexico who left Cuba in 1960. He has been the principal agent
of the LIONION Project since 1962. LIONION/l's cover is that
of a translator and would-be writer. Family holdings in
14-00000
-2-
Tampa, Florida, inherited from his deceased father also
provide financial backstopping. LIONION/1 received. his
"immigrado" (permanent immigrant) status in 1965 and now
has a good deal of immunity from harassment from Mexican
immigration authorities. All photographic coverage of the
main Embassy gate through final printing, cropping, and
mounting is processed by LIONION/1. LIONION/1 and LIONION/2
maintain a log which indicates when a photograph was taken,
and pertinent identifying data. License numbers of cars
used by various Cuban Embassy personnel are recorded as woll
as license numbers of cars of unidentified persons visiting
the Cuban Embassy.
3. LIONION/2 (201-305604): Mother of LIONION/1. Her
cover is that of a dependent mother. As with LIONION/1, she
has "immigrado" status and has been associated with the
LIONION Project since 1962. LIONION/2 acts as LIONION/1's
assistant and fill-in whenever he is away from the LIONION
basehouse.
Changes:
During the project year, the pulse camera coverage of
the Cuban Consulate entrance was discontinued. Little or no
use was being made of the product from this camera. One
reason for limited use was that there was no real way to
readily fix the time--or the day-- a particular photo was
taken. There were no other significant changes in the
project during FY 1970.
Accomplishments:
1. The LIONION production for FY 1970 consisted almost
entirely of photographic coverage of visitors to the Cuban
Embassy main entrance and of logs of the movement of Cuban
Embassy personnel and visitors. This proved very useful in
identifying new Cuban Embassy PCS cmployees in Mexico.
monitoring also revealed which cars the various employees
usually drove.
The
2. LIONION also tock photographs of what appeared to
be American visitors to the Cuban Embassy front gate.
In
the case of Americans who arrived in automobiles bearing
U.S. license plates, the license plate numbers, car
descriptions, and sterile copies of photographs were given
to LNERGO for identification.
14-00000
-3-
3. The Station also used the LIONION photographic
coverage and log to check on the reports of Mexican and
other JKLANCE assets who claimed to have visited the Cuban
Embassy. In the case of some assets, LIONION/1 was given
a photograph of the agent and told to be particularly alert
at cortain times of certain days to confirm the agent's
entry and exit. This proved particularly useful in checking
AVDIME/I's story of contact with the Cubans. It also con-
firmod LIRELIC/1's visit to the Cuban Embassy at an early
stage in Station recontact with LIRELIC/1.
Probloms :.
1.
No agent control or operational problems have been
reported. Noither were there any security problems
encountered during the period. LIONION/1 was mot in a
satohouso on an average of once por week by Andrew E.
PELLEMENT, in alias. Following PELLEMENT's departure in
late May, Gerald D. FAHLANGER took over the responsibility
for the LIONION Project. FAHLANGER, in alias, meets LIONION/1
approximately once per week. In January 1970, the Station
had LIONION/1 change the safehouse used for meetings with
Station officers. He signed a one-year lease on the new
apartmont, in alias. LIONION/1 uses the apartment on weekends
and ovonings to lend credence to the cover story he used in
ronting; 1.e., that he lives out-of-town and maintains this
small apartment in Mexico City for use during his frequent
visits.
2. Station visits to the LIONION basehouse were limited
to throw during the reporting period. These were made during
non-daylight hours. LIONION/1 picked up the Station officer
away from the LIONION basehouse area and drove the officer
to the baséhouse in LIONION/1's own car. The basehouse has
a driveway off the street entrance-way which facilitates.
entry during non-daylight hours.
3. During the Project Year, the pulse camera and the
electronic equipment used with the LISAMPAN operations were
removed from the baschouse, thus reducing the amount of
compromising equipment in the basehouse.

Coordination:
The Ambassador is aware of our efforts against the
Cuban target in general. He has not been specifically
briefed on this operation.
Future Plans:
1. The Station is re-examining the various points of
view which the LIONION basehouse provides of the Cuban
Embassy complex in order to determine what steps can be
taken to improve the usefulness of the LIONION product.
For instance, from the window in the room where the pulse
camera proviously was installed, an excellent view can be
had of the Cuban Embassy garden and the walkways between
the three Cuban Embassy buildings--as well as the Consulate.
The Station plans to have LIONION/1, on a spot-check basis,
observe the garden area. In this way, the Station hopes to
update its information on the location of the various
officers' offices, the general pattern of movement and
activity, etc. This area will also be observed during the
night to see if it can be determined which areas are being
used for living quarters or offices.
2. It is also planned to assess LIONION/1's ability
to observe and draw appropriate conclusions from his obser-
vations, and to write these up for the Station,
3. Depending on the need for Consulate coverage, the
installation of closed circuit-TV coverage of the Consulate
entrance is boing considered.
4.
The Station is being queried as to emergency contact
arrangements with LIONION/1.
