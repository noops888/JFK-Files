2023 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
SECRET
TO: Mrs. Potocki, FI/D
FROM: WB/1/CB - Granmist
Anita: In view of arrival of recent correspondence on the ABUSICAL case, I think it would
be best if we retained the current files here at
all times. However, I have made extracts from
the only documents in my files which refer to
SUZAN, and have included enough to make the
extracts intelligible. Hope they are satisfactory.
I would suggest that you also try to get a
look at Subject's file (i.e., AEUSICAL/1's file) in
CI/OA. The investigative reports may have something
on SUZAN. The investigative material I have does
not mention him except in one fleeting context: A
psychological assessment we made on A/1 mentioned
that among the people with whom A/1 had been
particularly closely associated during his past
was SUZAN. Merely mentions the name. No info on
SUZAN.
If you need additional support, suggest you
check with Los Raty, Swedish Desk, 1622 1, L-2619.
