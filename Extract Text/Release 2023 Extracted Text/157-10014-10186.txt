Re: CIA Mail Watch List

BY
On Friday, August 29, 1975, Messrs. Wallach, Dick
and Bushong travelled to Langley to review the Watch List
and letters purloined during the New York mail intercept operation.
At Langley, we met with Ernie Tsikadanos and Dan Rodman.
Rodman who is now singularly assigned to the vault to handle
FOIA requests stayed with us for the three hours we were there.
He also
with color
briefed us as to the nature of the docu-
ments, the retrieval processes and history of the project.
We reviewed the personal files of an "analyst" that
Jim Dick uncovered. We also reviewed the current Watch List,
randomly sampled the persons whose mail was opened (approximately
80% of mail opened was to or from persons not on Watch List),
and selectively reviewed certain months take. In this regard,
Jim looked at the months immediately preceding the December
1971 memorandum covering elected or appointed official's mail.
Jim and Tom Dawson had previously reviewed the Watch
Lists and taken down selected names.
of names, etc., attached hereto.
I copied down the list
