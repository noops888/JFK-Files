A. OPERATIONAL
1. During the period under review, financial support to the
AMSPELL organization has been reduced significantly. As reported
in roferences, the primary reason for the reduction was the
inconsistencies of many AMSPELL activities with current WOFACT
directives.
2. Cooperation between AMSPELL and the Station has been maintained
through AMHINT-2, the principal agent of the AMSPELL operation.
Although no longer being carried on a salaried basis, AMHINT-2 has
continued to be responsive to Station guidance.
3. AMSPELL has continued its correspondence with various student
groups and leaders throughout the free world, and especially in
Latin America. AMSPELL has contacted various international student
groups requesting passage money so that its delegates could be
afforded the opportunity to attend upcoming international student
conferences,
:
4. A campaign was launched to call attention to the plight of
Pedro Luis BOITEL, a Cuban student leader who was unjustly
imprisoned on the Isle of Pines by the CASTRO regime. A report/
denunciation of the imprisonment of BOITEL was prepared and sent
to AMSPELL's principal contacts in the Latin American student field
seeking support for AMSPELL's demand that BOITEL be released.

separate cover)
a.
:
AMSPELL efforts during recent months have been mainly
concentrated on the preparation of its new bi-monthly magazine.
8,000 copies of the magazine's first edition which was published
in May 1966 were distributed as follows:
(1) 3,000 copies sent to Latin America
(2) 1,100 copies distributed by AMSPELL delegations
(3)
3,000 copies distributed among Cubans in the United
States
(4) 100 copies were sent to AMSPELL contacts and
student movements in Europe, Africa, Asia, Canada, etc.
(5) Members of the AMSPELL organization also received
copies in which the AMSPELL internal bulletin was
inserted. Each member was asked to promote the sale
of subscriptions and advertising space as well as to
seek persons who would collaborate with the magazine
staff by contributing their talents.
(6) The remainder was distributed among the various
embassies, official representations of governments and
organizations, both in the United States and abroad, as
well as among Cuban exile journalists and organizations.
2. AMSPELL Cuban mailing
Since March 1966, 1,000 envelopes containing AMSPELL propa-
ganda have been mailed to Cuba on a monthly basis. This propaganda
is directed particularly at students who support the regime (copies
of the propaganda are being forwarded under separate cover).
3. Press...
The majority of AMSPELL press releases have been in connection
with the mistreatment of political prisoners by the Castro regime.
Other releases concerned the aforementioned BOITEL campaign and a
tribute to Cuban martyrs who gave their lives fighting against the
BATISTA dictatorship in 1957. (Copies of the press releases are being
forwarded under separate cover.)
CINAFINANCIAL
1. Final payment of AMSPELL salaries and termination bonuses was
made in February in line with the Station's reduction of financial
support to AMSPELL. Under the present arrangement JMWAVE support is
limited to $1,000 monthly, this includes the $200 monthly financial
support payment to AMHINT-l's family, office overhead, and support for
printing/distributing the bi-monthly publication,
2. The following amounts were expended by the Station in support
of AMSPELL activities during the second half of FY 66:
Operational expenses
Salaries and termination bonuses
Total expenditures
$ 9,929.74
6,200.00
$16,129.74
D. FUTURE PLANS
It is anticipated that AMSPELL efforts in the near future will be
directed at the upcoming CLAE meeting which is scheduled to be held
in Havana 29 July to 9 August 1966.
