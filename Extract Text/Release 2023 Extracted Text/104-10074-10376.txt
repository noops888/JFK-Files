RUSTY (RICHARDSON) to CHARLES re football games being
played following day and on Sunday. CHARLES indicates
preference for Sunday as the day SMALLS would go to
RICHARDSON residence and says he will pick up "those
sheets, if you have them done, too." RR: Yeah, ANITA
(RILIZ) was doing them today; that she told ANITA of
CHARLES' appreciation of work done and quoted ANITA
as saying, 'I enjoy doing it for two reasons, 1) because
I agree with everything he has to say, and the other is
because I like him so much.' CS: She's a good poli-
tician. RUSTY then chats with BS some shirts she had
requested someone to pick up in U.S., their getting
together on Sunday, etc.

Collect LD call from ABBOTT to CHARLES & BERTHE SMALL
He comments that he is working for ELIZABETH EUDY and
BERTHE asks if it is the same job. He says it is--same
stuff--but that work would run out pretty soon, that
he would thereafter work a little while "at a printer's.."
CHARLES says they got that info. by letter and asks ABBOTT
how about his coming here for Christmas. He says he still
does not know what is going to happen, adding that he is
"still hung up on CHLOE," that he is calling from the
BUTLERS (JEAN and children).

He mentions having talked
with DENNIS several times recently. CS says they just
heard from DENNIS that he had won"a second prize in
poetry translation, " for which he received twenty dollars.
CS inquires with regard to the "guy you're consulating...
is he any help?" ABBOTT comments that it helps "off and
on" and BS asks if he's sticking with it... "Your therapy."
He says he is. She urges him to give therapy a chance.
He says it has helped some, adding that he had cried
in two out of the four sessions; that he thinks the guy
is great; that he was just sort of lonesome for CHLOE;
that analyst feels that "I have kind of dammed up and
blocked up a lot of emotion which was giving me other
kinds of mental problems," that he has helped some; that
if he does not come for Christmas, he will probably come
down around New Year's or shortly thereafter. SMALLS.
say DENNIS is expected to arrive here around 16th December
ABBOTT says he has had some "down periods" and some "up
periods." BS asks if he is able to function and he
replies "Off and on," that at times he feels frustrated.

萬案真浅装 BS alludes to his housing setup and he says
it is pretty good; that they are four and may possibly
be five, has worked out rather nicely. BS asks if he
does not see the EUDYS very frequently and, when he
advises affirmatively, comments that that is "very
good." ABBOTT: And DICK WESHEIMER (ph.) has been very
good too. BS: Oh, that's lovely. He's a lovely, lovely
guy. CS comments that they "are all great people."
ABBOTT says he has been seeing a few women and has a
couple of men friends..."I just don't feel that close
to anybody...kind of impatient." BS asks about his
physical health. SMALL comments that ASHER GORDON
(apparently referring to a doctor consulted by ABBOTT)
had been in Mexico on which occasion he had dropped by
SMALL store. ABBOTT expects to remain in Los Angeles
until Sunday; that he drove down and will head back
(for San Francisco). ABBOTT also comments that "I have
just written MAURICE (HALPERIN a long letter" (apparently
dealing with possibility of work; that there is a "really
good place in Berkeley" next year.
BS wishes him a happy
Thanksgiving, etc.

OSCAR (LEWIS) to CHARLES SMALL & latter asks where he is
calling from. OSCAR says he is in Havana and wants to
thank CS for "those lovely books you sent...one for JUDY
and one for us." CS: That's right. OSCAR mentions their
appreciation and CS says it is a "nice way of saying hello
OSCAR says he is not too well health-wise; that he has a
lot of pain every day and "I'm pushing an awful lot of
nitro-glycerin and other very powerful heart dialators
every day, that he has very bad chest pains but that
there is nothing to do; that he was thinking of possibly
coming to Mexico during December but CS advises against
December. OSCAR says he has some rather exciting possi-
bilities on his literary work, has a movie offer on
'Children of Sanchez,' that MARIO HERNANDEZ, who says he
wrote screenplay for 'Zapata', is "here now"; that
this man wrote screenplay on OSCAR's book, 'A death in
the Sanchez family,' that screenplay is not bad and (LUIS)
BUNUEL reportedly is interested; that HERNANDEZ wants a
letter to authorize him to go ahead with "Children of
