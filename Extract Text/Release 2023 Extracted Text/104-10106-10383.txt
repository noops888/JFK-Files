Official Cover for Mr. Thomas L. Roberts)
1. We have been informed by the Clandestine Service
Agent Panel that they pose no objection to the conversion
of Mr3 Roberts from Staff Agent status to Staff Employee
status which will enable him to work regularly in the
eadquarters building. They do, however, feel that prior
to his conversion a suitable cover, consistent with his
legal background, must be arranged.
2. In informal discussions with your office, a
possibility of arranging non-official cover with a local
law firm was discussed. This law firm would ostensibly
have contracts with various government agencies.
Mr Roberts) will be hired by the law firm to serve as a
legal advisor to the government agencies thus enabling
him to be gone from the office a great part of the time.
In view of his many contacts in government and private
circles, this type of cover would hold up since some of
his friends may try to physically reach him at the
office.
