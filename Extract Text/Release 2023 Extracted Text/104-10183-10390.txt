2023 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
22 March 196
MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: ANTRUNK (Leonardo) Status Report
03.
1. The four principals are still safehoused "say out
of Miami" and undergoing training. Zeta Rastres completed
the FI type training phase ca 16 March 1963 and returned to
Headquarters. The week of 18 to 23 March is being utilized
primarily for operational discussions, documentation, cover,
communications planning, and agent assessment. Details of
WAVE handling of the ANTRUNK operation thru 5 March 63 are
provided in Operational Memoranda attached to UPGA-7993
(attached hereto).

2. Cover arrangements for ANTRUNK-14 (DIAZ Isalgus) and
ANTRUNK-3 (GARCIA Perez) are being finalized and no problems
are anticipated. Cover for ANTRUNK-27 (Dr. MORENO) and ANTRUNK-2
04(CATADO Ribare) was previously arranged. Bi-weekly support
payments to the wives of C-27, ANTRUNK-14, and ANTRUNK-2
through the cover backstops are being arranged to begin 29
March 1963. Salary payments to ANTRUNK-3 will be held in
escrow.
3. On 20 March 1963 WAVE forwarded the results of the
LCFLUTTER exams on the four principals. ANTRUNK-1 and ANTRUNK-
2 passed their LCFLUTTER exams but the examiner rates
"inconclusive" on ANTRUNK-14 and ANTRUNK-27. In transmitting the
LCFLUTTER reports to Headquarters by dispatch (111)
WAVE commented that it was the opinion of the LCFLUTTER
examiner and the WAVE ANTRUNK case officer that ANTRUNK-17 might
well drop out of the operation if asked to take the LCFLUTTER
exam, particularly due to his reluctance to take it in the
first place. In DIA 26430 of 21 March 1963 we cautioned
WAVE against insistence on a second LCFLUTTER for ANTRUNK-27
or any other member of ANTRUNK and asked WAVE to advise
Headquarters prior to taking any action if the station prefers
an additional LCFLUTTER is necessary. Regarding handling of
-2-
ANTRUNK-27; it is quite clear that "control" is a factor.
Security is a big factor in the operation. Some of the
principals have told people they had no business telling
(ANTRUNK-3 told four persons) about going on a mission
with others involved in the operation. We are tracing all
such persons that we know of. There are attached copies
of the LCFLUTTER reports (LEES have not yet been received).
4. Except for a letter which ANTRUNK-27 (MORENO)
sent to Mr. Alfonso Rodrigues via (Zeke Ramirez, which I
understand was brought to the attention of C/SAS and EC/SAB,
there is nothing further to report on at this time. As far
as I know we are still aiming for infiltration sometime in
April.
