Appraisal of Content: 3.
In early January 1963 Manolo Ray, former leader of the Cuban
exile group, ,/ Movimiento Revolucionario del Pueblo (MRP,
People's Revolutionary Movement) and now head of the Junta
Revolucionaria (JURE, Revolutionary Junta), stated that the
JURE is now concentrating its efforts on organizing
internal resistance in Cuba..

According to Ray, the JURE controls the following groups
with forces inside Cuba: the MRP, the 30th of November
Revolutionary Movement, Federacion Estudiantil Univer-
sitaria (FEU, University Students Federation), Accion
Cristiana (AC, Christian Action) and the Movimiento de
Recuperacion Revolucionaria Cubana (MRRC, Cuban
Q
Revolutionary Recovery Movement).1 Present plans are
limited, first of all, to rebuilding these resistance.
forces which have now nearly recovered from the losses
sustained during the April 1961 Bahia de Cochinos
invasion, and secondly, to establishing contact with
non-Communists in Cuba and persuading them to reject
the Castro regime and to aid the resistance movement.
Ray added that no date will be set for starting the
operations until sufficient resources are available to
permit sustained action. A tentative estimate is that
another three months will be required to collect the
necessary resources.

Headquarters Comment. It is doubtful that Ray "controls"
all these organizations, although some members from them
have probably joined me RE.
