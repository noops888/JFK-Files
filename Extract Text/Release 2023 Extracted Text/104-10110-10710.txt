substantiated report that Subject subscribed to the Communist
publication "VOZ de MEXICO" and was a Communist leader in
1944. He reportedly was a leader of the Communist nucleus in
the Chicago Mexican colony. According to a notation dated 6/26/63,
this information was "considered resolved in Subject's favor through
1959 B.L. conducted on Subject's sister." DCS was also informed
that Subject's sister (Maria Guadalupe GALLARDO, with various
akas) was reported by reliable informants to have been a member
of the Mexican Commission of the Communist Party in 1946 and a
card carrying Communist Party member in 195L During an inter-
viewin 1954, she admitted attending meetings of the Communist
Party and a Communist Party school during the mid-1930's in Chicago
but denied having attended Communist Party affairs subsequent to 1945,
or to ever having been a member of the Communist Party.
