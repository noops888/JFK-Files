2023 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
As you can see, haste often
makes for much waste!!
After No. 16, things begin
to get a bit confused as you
can clearly see. I have no
way of knowing what is what.
Therefore, I have made two
versions -- both of them are
probably incorrect -- but
I had no other choice.
Anyway, after Paragraph 16,
everything seems to be a
mess.
hj
Also note the spelling of
Alvarado is two different
ways -- I just picked one
and did it the same way
twice. I don't know which
is correct.

was omitted from the transcript, and the CIA
claimed it did not know of most of Oswald's
activities in Mexico City until after the
assassination.
16. COMMENT: "CIA claimed it did not know of most of
OSWALD's activities in Mexico City until after the assassination."
This is true; however, it should be pointed out that after the
dissemination on 10 October of the 1 October 1963 contact no re-
quests were received from the recipients of the report for further
information or follow-up investigation. Under the Delimitations
Agreement, OSWALD, as a former Marine, was a Navy and FBI case
and potentially of interest to the Department of State.
17.
In interviews with The Post, Belin, who docu-
mented the CIA plots against Castro in his capacity
as executive director of the Rockefeller commission,
revealed the CIA also did not tell the Warren Com-
mission of a report from an alleged witness to a
meeting in Mexico City between Oswald and Cuban
intelligence agents.
COMMENT: Is BELIN referring to Gilberto ALVARADO
Urgate? If so, information regarding OSWALD provided by ALVARADO
was passed to the Warren Commission as attachments to a memorandum
for J. Lee RANKIN, dated 1 June 1964, from Richard HELMS, Deputy
Director for Plans.
(See also Memorandum for J. Lee RANKIN, dated 4 June
1964, from Richard HELMS; subject: Information Developed on the
Activity of Lee Harvey OSWALD in Mexico City. This memorandum
became Commission Exhibit No. 3152 contained in Volume XXVI of
Warren Commission report.)
Belin called on the CIA to make full disclosure
of its knowledge of Oswald and his contacts with the
Cubans and Russians.

No real recollection of who might have gone over Win Scptt's
records after he died in 1970. Tjink it was someone from CI.
BEb Shaw recalls the following names of possible sources:
Anne Goodpaster (Scott's secretary) now retired to Texas
She carried the tapes back and forth.
Charlotte Zaring Bustos (now Videla), currently on home leave
from(COS Trinidad
27,16-25
Alan White was DCOS Mexico during some of this time. Now retired.
Tex Puckett, personally close to Scott, but left April/May 1963.
How retired.
تون
Joe Loftus phoned back from LA to name Dick Sampson as a possible, but
he was COS (according to someone in background) 1973-75.
Russ Holmes phoned to say that he found the pseudo of a Douglas J. FEINGLASS,
speaking on the atrocious Russian of the man who had identified himself as
Lee Oswald. I asked Joe Loftus if he can identify that man's true name.
