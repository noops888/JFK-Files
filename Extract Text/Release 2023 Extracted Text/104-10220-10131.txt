1. In late November 1959, Julia Cellini, Assistant to
Edward K. Moss, Public Relations, attended a dinner party where
she was introduced to the Deputy Finance Minister of Rumania.
This individual was in Washington for consultations with the
International Bank, ICA, State, etc. He asked her what he
should see in Washington, and she recommended the usual places,
plus Charlottesville.
15.30359
2. The following week she was invited to a farewell
dinner for the Rumanian Cultural Attache, whom she had previously
met. The Deputy Finance. Minister came up, remembered her name
and said that he had seen everything she had recommended, including
a weekend at Charlottesville. He had taken along his superior,
the Finance Minister, and at the party, introduced him to Miss
Cellini. The conversation was in French, although the Minister
did understand English.
3. The Minister asked her what else to see during their
remaining week, and she recommended the Monastery, Mt. Vernon,
etc. Ee thereupon asked her to accompany them to lunch, and she
explained that she could not, that she worked. On Friday, the
Minister called her to accompany them on the trip to Mt. Vernon
on Saturday. She did not wish to do so, but could not gracefully
get out of it. On Saturday it was raining and the trip was called
off when she said she could not join them on Sunday. The Minister
called her once more before leaving Washington.
4. This memorandum is written for the record of the fact
that both the Minister and Deputy Minister of Finance had shown
considerable interest in Miss Cellini, in the event that it might
be of any use at some future date.

SUBJECT: Vacancy for Secretary in Embassy of Guinea
A-72684
DATE. 11 September 1959
File Judex
Edward K. Mosa notified this office today that the
Ambassador from Guinea is in the process of setting up his
Imbassy in Washington, having returned to the U.S. last week.
He is looking for a chancery, an embassy, and a residence, as
well as his basic staff.
2. He requires a female secretary, whom he states must
be attractive, with shorthand abilities in French and Inglish.
She must not be a French citizen or have had employment by the
French Government. Her salary would be in the vicinity of $400
a month, tax free. A white woman is preferable.
3. Moss said that the Ambassador has had difficulty in
locating such a person and has asked Moss to help, so that anyone
we wished could properly be introduced through this means. Moss
pointed out that, since the girl would be the first employee of
a small staff, she would attain a very important position. He
felt that this might be significant in that Frime Minister, Toure
is politically "on the fence". Toure himself will be in Washington
on a State visit on 25 October 1959.
4. Please inform this office of any reaction to this
suggestion.

HOLD FOR RELEASE:
AFTER 5:00P.M., E.S. T.
THURSDAY, NOV. 27, 1958
STATEMENT OF THE AMBASSADOR
OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE SUDAN
Dr. Ibrahim Anis, Ambassador of the Republic of The Sudan, today
reaffirmed his country's friendship for the United States in a statement issued on
the eve of his departure for Khartoum, scheduled originally for early this month
but delayed until tomorrow because of the formation of a new government in The
Sudan earlier this month.
Dr. Anis' statement follows:
"I would like to thank the American public and especially the American
press for the thoughtful consideration with which they received and appraised the
news of the recent developments in my country. Thanks to your refusal to jump to
hasty conclusions and make comparisons with events in other countries which would
not apply to The Sudan, the relations between our countries have not been strained
as they might have been through misunderstanding and we remain today good friends.
"The Government of my country was changed because partisan strife
between political parties threatened to bring about a demoralization of our people
and a loss of confidence in our ability as a nation to preserve the principles of free-
dom and independence to which our people are determined to adhere.
"A government of stability, including both military and civil leaders.
acting with the approval of the spiritual leaders of our country, has assumed respon-
sibility to the people to resolve our internal problems and to maintain cordial rela-
tions with all other countries as befitting a free and independent, democratic Repub-
lic. It has assumed the responsibility in a peaceful and orderly manner without im-
pairing the rights of dissident elements or freedom of movement of any of our citizens
or visitors to our country. It has assured complete freedom of the press. It has
pledged itself to be bound by and give full effect to the agreements into which the
Republic of The Sudan has entered since our independence nearly three years ago.

"In doing this my country has not been moved by external pressures
or by any feeling of unfriendliness towards other countries. On the contrary, our
Prime Minister, El Ferik Ibrahim Pasha Abboud, and his Government will work
to improve these relations on the basis of mutual respect, friendship and mutual
interest.
"Parainount among the problems of relations with other countries
to which our Government will address itself will be to give expression to the con-
viction of every Sudanese that it is of utmost importance to bring about a fair
division of the waters of the Nile which flow from our country into Egypt and which
are of great importance to the economic development of both nations.
"Our new Government has now been recognized by virtually every
other country, including your own. As iny nation's representative in the United
States since our independence I have seen the steady growth of closer relations
and greater understanding between our countries. I am made confident by the re-
cent evente in my country and the sympathetic response to them by your country,
that these cordial relations will endure and, indeed, can now be made even more
strong.
"It is my pleasure that my diplomatic career began and ended with
my service as Ambassador to the United States. It is a happy coincidence that
my last day in the United States is Thanksgiving Day. For me it is a day on which
I give thanks for all the wonderful friends I have made here, It is a day on which
I congratulate all Americans for the friendship they have extended to me and to my
country. Although I am returning to private life, I want them all to know I shall
never cease my efforts to bring about increasingly close relations between our
two nations."
A copy of this material is filed with the Department of Justice where the re-
quired statement under the Foreign Agents Registration Act is available for
public inspection. Registration does not indicate approval or disapproval of

00--3,117,581 and Thanos, Areson converention of 15 December 1958.
1. We have received a response to your verbal request o
15 December 1958 for further biogaphic information on Lillian
Karika.
2. Lillian Karika is described as rather unattructive
physically, in her 40's, chunky and unkempt. This iapression
is dissipated when she begins to sponk, Mích is done with
great animtion. However, she abuses the English langamge to
such a degree that it is hard to believe that she could have
passed the Eew York Bar. She is obviously restless, energetic
and ambitious, with apparently no interests outside of work.
She is alsays furiously working on some scheme or other, in
addition to her Grek bank project. She was recently involved
in the manganent difficulties at the Hotel 2400 in kachington
and is also considering managing an Italian singer on a US tour.
These divergent offorts scen to be typical. Source has never
beard bar coerent on politics or her education, but she apparently
is strongly pro-UB. She was most upset when she heard a story
in Greece that she was nagotiating for the purchase of bar bank
by a group through the Bunc-du-Ford, which group smo reportedly
Cormimist. She caused quite a comotion in the US Embassy in
Athens to be sure that there was no misunderstanding of her
position.
3. Source believes that Mr. O'Brien of the US Dabassy in
Athens should know a good deal about her, and that there have
also been several detailed accounts about her and her activities
in the Greek press.
