P-o-p-k-i-n-s, Lane, Alexandria, Virginia, 22307.
4
Mr. Johnston. Mr. Halpern, you previously testified before
5
the Committee, and I assume you know that you have various rights,
6
the right to counsel, and that you previously have been furnished
a copy of the Committee rules, is that correct?
7
Mr. Halpern.
That is correct.
8
Mr. Johnston.
And you're testifying here today voluntarily.
9
C
Mr. Halperns That is correct.
10
Mr. Johnston.
What was your position with the CIA in the

O & PAUL
WARD
period, say, June to December, 19637
12
Mr. Halpern. I was the executive officer for the Special
13
14
Affairs Staff of the Directorate of Plans. The staff was
responsible for operations against Cuba at that time.
15
Mr. Johnston.
And you were executive assistant to Mr.
16
Fitzgerald, who was chief.
17
Mr. Halpern. That is correct.
18
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Senator Schweiker.
Were they two different capacities, os
19
the same?
20
Mr. Halpern.
It's the same. The actual title was Executive
21
Officer at that time.
22
Senator Schweiker. Okay.
23
Mr. Johnston. And prior to Mr. Fitzgerald's taking over
24
25
the Special Affair's Staff, Mr. Harvey was in that position, is

that correct?.
1
Mr. Halpern. That's correct. It was then called Task Force
2
W, and was under Mr. Harvey.
3
Mr. Johnston.
And did you have a similar capacity under
4
him?
5
Mr. Halpern. Yes, I was Executive Officer under TFW.
6
Mr. Johnston.
And when did you leave the Special Affairs
7
Staff?
8
Mr. Halpern. To the best of my recollection, sometime
9
around late summer or around Labor Day of 1964.
10
Senator Schweiker.
When did you come aboard it?
11
Mr. Halpern. The staff?
12
Senator Schweiker.
13
14
I guess.
15
16
In other words, Task Force W.
other words, whatever it was called at the time, Task Force W
Mr. Halpern. I was in the branch of the Western Hemisphere
Division when it was taken out of the Western Hemisphere Division
In
17
and turned into Task Force W, and that was in early '62.
18
19
Mr. Johnston. What were your responsibilities as executive
officer to Mr. Fitzgerald?
20
Mr. Halpern. Almost anything he wanted me to do.
Basicall
21
it was to be sure that all of the papers that did reach his
22
desk were in correct form, content and distribution and routing
23
I screened cable traffic for him to be sure he saw what I though
24
he should see. The same was true with memoranda coming to his

a paper-pusher, traffic cop on paper, people problems, my door
was open to any and all to discuss matters that they themselves
didn't feel that they wanted to talk to the boss about, and I.
5
acted as a screen in that regard.
But basically I was there
6
to do whatever the boss wanted me to do, as an aide does.
7
Mr. Johnston. Did you have operational responsibilities?
8
C
103
9
10
Mr. Halpern. Only those he gave me from time to time.
Nothing in the line of command. From time to time I did get
involved in operational activities.
I had one specific field

of endeavor, and that was liaison with British intelligence.
Mr. Johnston.
12
Were you knowledgeable of operational
matters?
13
14
Mr. Halpern.
Yes, quite a bit. I didn't see everything,
15
but I saw an awful lot, and I was knowledgeable of most operational
matters.
16
Senator Schweiker.
How large a staff at Langley did
17
Desmond Fitzgerald's SAS have at its peak at lleadquarters?
18
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Mr. Halpern. To the best of my recollection, about 150
19
at Headquarters.
20
Senator Schweiker. When it was Task Force W, how large would
21
it be?
22
Mr. Halpern.
200, 225, something like that.
That's very
23
much a guess at this point.
That includes officers and clerical,
24
that's the total force.

Right.
Mr. Johnston. Who did Mr. Fitzgerald report to on Cuban
matters?
3
Mr. Halpern.
To the DDP.
4
Mr. Johnston.
That was Mr.Helms at the time.
5
Mr. Halpern.
That's right.
6
Mr. Johnston.
Did he also report to Mr. Cane, J. C. Cane?
7
Mr. Halpern. Oh, no, no, no, there was nothing like that.
8
9
It was taken completely out of the divisional, regional lines
of command and made a special staff.
10
11
12
Senator Schweiker. There was nothing that related to
Cuba, Cuban activity or anti-Castro activity, after that was
done, that went through the formally normal channel.

14
15
16
17
18
19
Mr. Halpern. Only in regard to seeking the help of the
Western Hemisphere Division and its stations, to help us in
our activities. Obviously Cuba was still part of the Western
Hemisphere geographically, and you need to have help, for
example, if we are going to send people from TFW or SAS into
Mexico or into Venezuela, you had to get permission of the
holding division. So in that regard we had an awful lot of

23
24
25
work to do with and constant liaison and communication with the
Western Hemisphere Division, the same kind of activity we had
with other divisions such as Europe, where we had quite a bit
of..activity in Spain because of the Cuban refugees in Spain.
But most of it was at that time obviously with the Western

TOP SECRET
Mr. Johnston. Did SAS in the fall of 1963 have any of its
own people in Mexico City?
Mr. Halpern. Yes. How many, I don't know, but we did have
some that were attached to the station there, under the station
command.
The staff had no authority to break the chains of command,
and everything that was communicated to and from the SAS
assignees anywhere else in the world went through WH Division
here in Washington, and they saw the replies when it came from
the station.
11
12
Mr. Johnston. Do you recall whether Mr. David Phillips was
13
one of the SAS people in Mexico City?
Mr. Halpern. No, I do not.
14
Mr. Johnston.
You do not recall?
15
Mr. Halpern. I do not recall.
16
17
Mr. Johnston. Who provided counterintelligence support
to the Special Affairs Staff?
18
Mr. Halpern. We had our own small counterintelligence
19
staff. I believe, if memory serves me, it was headed up some
20
during this period by Hal Swenson, who is a CI specialist, and
21
22
we always had, of course, the support of the CI Staff of the Do.
under Mr. Angleton.

But basically each of the divisions in this case, it was
in effect a division, even though it was called a staff, had or

own small counterintelligence operation.
Senator Schweiker. Going back to a question that Jim
1
2
3
asked, the SAS office in Mexico City was headed up by whom ?
4
5
Mr. Halpern. I don't know, sir.
We had people assigned to the station in Mexico, but I don't
know who was there. I don't remember.
6
Senator Schweiker.
SAS had people.
7
Mr. Halpern. Yes.
We had people there, we had some in
8
Madrid, I believe, and we may have had them in other places..
9
at various strategic areas around the world.
10
Senator Schweiker. Well, who would the head of the SAS
11
in Mexico City have reported to?
12
13
Mr. Halpern. To the Chief of Station.
Senator Schweiker. To the Chief of Station.
14
Mr. Halpern.
To the Chief of Station, that's correct.
He
15
was under the Chief of Station's command.

20

Senator Schweiker. The Chief of Station would have reporte
to the Western Hemisphere Division?
Mr. Halpern. That is correct, but the way it operated not
only with Mexico but any other place is that the SAS people
reported through the Chief of Station.
The Chief of Station's
messages were then sent to Washington, and all messages were
addressed to the Director and the cable secretary who made the
distribution because of the necessary slugs that were on there.
The action in most cases, because it was originated by an SAS
