The following report is one of a series containing personality
information provided by the source and includes supplemental
information from the records of this Agency.
It is requested that the addressees take no action on any of
the individuals mentioned in the personality reports without
first checking with this Agency.
1. Source identified Baldemiro CASTRO Garcia, a
Dominican, as a member of the Marxist-Leninist Movimiento
Popular Dominicano (MPD) who was a student at the guerrilla
warfare training school in Cuba. Source only saw CASTRO
once, and this was at the home of the delegate of the
pro-Castro Agrupacion Politica Catorce de Junio (APCJ) in
Habana.
2. CASTRO was described by source as being about
5'8" tall, thin, and wearing a mustache.
Headquarters Comments:
1. The representative of the APCJ in Habana was probably
Socrates Isaias "Pupo" PEGUERO Sehourer. A usually
reliable source reported in TDCS-314/05506-64 that
PEGUERO will be removed from his position as representative
of the APCJ in Habana, and will be replaced by Daniel
MATIAS Abrou, who is now in Habana.
2. According to another source CASTRO is white, 5'10", has
a pock-marked face, kinky hair, and is "pop-eyed."

CSCI-316/02546-64
In May 1962 an untested source, who was then a member of the MPD,
said that CASTRO was probably Secretary of Workers' Affairs on
the Central Committee of the MPD. (See CS-3/511,325). An official 24
Jamaican service reported in CS-3/561.001 that CASTRO arrived in
Kingston, Jamaica, on 18 September 1963 en route to Habana as a
delegate to attend the Seventh Congrees of the International Union
of Architects, to be held from 29 September to 3 October 1963.
His passport, No. 115933, issued on 10 September 1963, stated
that he was born on 5 May 1998 in Santo Domingo and that he was
an industrial employee. In December 1963 an untested source, a
member of the MPD. reported that the first rebel groups under
the direction of the MPD had been formed at Hato Mayor and at
• El Seibo, in the eastern part of the Dominican Republic, and that
the Rato Mayor group, composed of about 150 men from all leftist
parties, was under the leadership of Roman Baldemiro CASTRO.
(See TDCS 3/567,279). In October 1964 CASTRO is reported to have
returned to the Dominican Republic from Cuba. (See CS-311/06078-64).
CASTRO is married to Ana Mercedes ESPINAL, and they have six
children.
