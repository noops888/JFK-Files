MENT IN MURDERS, BECAUSE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH "PUBLIC EVIDENCE"
AGAINST HIM, AND BOTH THE GOVERNOR AND FEDERAL DEPUTY CESAR

COMPLICITY IN THE CRIME. END SUMMARY.)
ON 30 AUGUST 1967, RAFAEL ROCHA CORDERO, COMMANDANT
OF AGENTS OF THE SECRET SERVICE OF THE FEDERAL DISTRICT, STATED
THAT GUERRERO GOVERNOR, RAIMUNDO ABARCA ALARCON, WAS INVOLVED
IN THE MASSACRE OF COPRA WORKERS AT ACAPULCO, GUERRERO, ON 20
AUGUST.
ROCHA EXPLAINED THAT PROFESSIONAL GUNMEN WHO FIRED
ON THE COPRA WORKERS FROM THE UNION BUILDING WHICH THE COPRA
WORKERS SOUGHT TO ENTER INCLUDED SIX PERSONS WHO SERVE AS ARMED
ESCORTS FOR GOVERNOR ABARCA AND HIS AIDES.

1. RAFAEL CORDERO, COMMANDANT
2. JORGE UDAVE GONZALEZ, CHIEF OF THE SIXTH INVESTIGATIVE
GROUP OF THE SECRET SERVICE STATED THAT HE HAD CHECKED PERSON-
ALLY ON THE CASE AND HAD VERIFIED THAT THE GUNMEN WHO FIRED
FROM THE UNION BUILDING WERE PROFESSIONALS KNOWN TO BE IN THE
T
PAY OF GOVERNOR ABARCA ON A PERMANENT BASIS. (UDAVE ADDED THAT
ALL EVIDENCE HE HAD SEEN TO DATE INDICATED THAT THE KILLING OF
THE COPRA WORKERS WAS THE RESULT OF THE GOVERNOR'S HAVING SENT

HIS HIRED GUNMEN TO DEFEND THE UNION BUILDING AND UNION OFFICIALS
WHEN WORD WAS RECEIVED THAT THE COPRA WORKERS WERE MARCHING ON
ACAPULCO TO DEMAND AND END TO THE ILLEGAL LEVY WHICH THEY HAVE
BEEN FORCED TO PAY TO UNION LEADERS AND THE GOVERNOR. [UDAVE](C)
:
NOTED THAT ALL MAJOR INDUSTRIAL, AND ORGANIZED AGRICULTUR AL
AND MINING ENTERPRISES DELIVER ILLEGAL PAYMENTS TO THE GOVERNOR
WITHOUT EQUIVOCATION, AND THAT IT IS MOST IMPROBABLE THAT THE
COPRA WORKERS WOULD EVER HAVE CONSIDERED PROTESTING THEIR OWN
LEVY HAD THEY NOT BEEN INCITED TO DO SO BY CESAR DEL ANGEL
FUENTES, FEDERAL DEPUTY FROM VERACRUZ..
Mexico
3. ROCHA STATED THAT IT WAS MOST UNLIKELY THAT THE ACAPULCO
KILLINGS WOULD COST ABARCA THE GOVERNORSHIP SINCE THERE IS NOT
ENOUGH "PUBLIC EVIDENCE" OF ABARCA'S INVOLVEMENT. ROCHA EX-
PLAINED THAT UNLESS EVIDENCE POSSESSED BY FEDERAL AUT HORITIES
WERE PUBLISHED, PRESIDENT GUSTAVO DIAZ ORDAZ WOULD HAVE NO
(C)
REASON TO ORDER ABARCA OUT OF OFFICE. ROCHA STATED THAT
ABARCA WAS FULLY AWARE OF THE EXTENT OF THE GOVERNMENT'S IN-
FORMATION ABOUT HIS INVOLVEMENT AND WAS WISELY PLAYING THE
(C)
ROLE OF INNOCENT SCAPEGOAT. ( ROCHA ROCHA OFFERED THE OPINION THAT
THE GOVERNMENT WOULD PLACE GREAT PRESSURE ON CESAR DEL ANGEL

CERTAIN THAT THE GOVERNOR WAS INVOLVED IN THAT KILLING AS WELL
UDAVE SAID THAT LOPEZ CISNEROS HAD BECOME GREEDY FOR GRAFT AND
HAD TRESPASSED ON THE GOVERNOR'S OWN PRIVATE GRAFT PRESERVE, SO
THAT THE GOVERNOR WAS FORCED TO ELIMINATE HIM WHEN BUSINESSMEN
PROTESTED THAT THEY WERE BEING FORCED TO PAY GRAFT TO TWO

MASTERS AND WERE RECEIVING NO PROTECTION FROM THE GOVERNOR
ACCORDING TO UDAVE ABARCA IS A PAST-MASTER AT CONCEALING HIS

ING EARLIER THIS YEAR. (FIELD COMMENTS IN MARCH 1967, THỂ

PERSONALLY HAD SEEN EVIDENCE THAT GOVERNOR ABARCA WAS MORE RE-

WHERE THE KILLING OF COPRA WORKERS TOOK PLACE.
