one Samuel Herman Horton, former Bureau Agent who resigned in December,
1944 to accept a position with the Office of Strategic Services.

Bureau Agent and now an employee of CIA has recommended that only a former
Bureau Agent should be placed in Canada so that the proper relationship could
be initiated with FBI Liaison Officer Officer Glenn H. Bethel Harvey has furhter
stated to his associates that any former Bureau Agent now working for CIA can
(U) gain the confidence of Bethel and thereby have an entree with the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police and other excellent contacts established by Betherland the FBI
throughout the years. Harvey hasalso reportedly stated that, due to Bethel's
"peculiar personality", heefeels it necessary that Hortonbe assigned to the
job in question so that "Bethel might be properly handled."
