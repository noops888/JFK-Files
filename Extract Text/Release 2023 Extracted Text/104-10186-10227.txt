4. An untested source in a report dated 5 July 1962 said that Jose
REBELLON Alonso, recently elected president of the Federacion
Estudiantil Universitaria (FEU), a Cuban university student group,
was scheduled to leave Cuba on 19 June 1962 for Canada. The
reason for the trip was to attempt to reach an agreement with the
University Student Federation of Canada which wants to break
relations with the FEU. He was to pass through Mexico either on
his way to Canada or on his return trip.
5. An official Jamaican service in a report dated 5 October 1962,
stated that Jose REBELLON Alonso was one of a group of Cuban
students who arrived in Kingston from Habana on 25 June 1962 and
proceeded to Toronto on 26 June 1962 to attend an International
Conference of Students. REBELLON was listed as having been born
on 7 August 1936 in Holguin, Oriente, Cuba, and his home address
was given as the University of Habana.
6. A fairly reliable source, in a report dated 3 April 1963, stated
that Jose REBELLON Alonso, leader of the FEU, is very close to
Fidel CASTRO and very opposed to Juan MARINELLO Vidaurreta, Rector
of the University of Habana.
7. In a report dated 5 September 1963, an educated Cuban whose
reliability has not yet been established, stated that as of late
June 1962, Comandante Jose REBELLON Alonso was Director of Plans
for Latin American Scholarships, Commission of Foreign Relations,
Partido Unico Revolucionario Socialista (United Revolutionary
Socialist Party - PURS) and also president of the FEU.
8. According to a report dated 26 March 1964, Jose REBELLON Alonso was
ordered to proceed to Europe to coordinate efforts on a new
milk plan which was announced by Fidel CASTRO. REBELLON was
designated to head up this new milk plan.
9. An untested source, in a report dated 28 July 1964, stated that
as of 6 July 1964, it was planned for Major Jose REBELLON Alonso,
Secretary of the FEU, to leave the University of Habana sometime
in 1964. Source said it was possible that Joaquin MAS Martinez
would replace REBELLON as president.
