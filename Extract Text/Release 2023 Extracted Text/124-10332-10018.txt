Miami indices contained a 'communication from
JUSTIN F. GLEICHAUF, CIA representative, under date of
subject as a former Cuban senator who had collaborated on
matters relating to the publication from time to time called
"Esbirros". (This information, according to CIA, came from
a usually reliable source.
Communication was classified "secret"
An investigation by the Miami Office of "Esbirros"
disclosed it was a two or three-page mimeographed "scandal
sheet" directed against the Frente Revolucionario Democratico
(FRD), as well as all other groups and individuals both pro
and anti-FIDEL CASTRO, according to MM 492-S. It was noted
that many individuals, anti-CASTRO and anti-communist, had
accused many other individuals of printing "Esbirros", which
had resulted in the paper not being printed or published in
January, 1961. This paper received very limited distribution,
and it was not believed it had been printed in December, 1960.
