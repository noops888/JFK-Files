TESTIMONY OF THOMAS KARAMESSINES
:
Mr. Johnston. Would you state for the record you full
name and address?
Mr. Karamessines. Thomas Karamessines, 6726 Kennedy
Lane, Falls Church, Virginia.
Mr. Johnston. And you have previously testified before
7
the Committee, and have been furnished a copy of the rules,

Committee, is that correct?

Mr. Karamessines. Yes.
Mr. Johnston. Let the record show that Senator
Schweiker will be here presently.
But it is my understanding, Mr. Karamessines, that it
is agreeable to go ahead without the Senator present?
Mr. Karamessines.
Mr. Johnson. Would you state for the record your posi-
17
tion with the Agency in the fall of 1963?
18
Mr. Karamessines.
I was Assistant Deputy Director for
19
Plans.
20
Mr. Johnson. And the Director for Plans was Mr. Helms,
21
is that correct?
22
Mr. Karamessines.
Correct.
23
Mr. Johnston. And would you describe briefly --
24
Mr. Karamessines.
I should correct that. The Deputy

Plans.
Mr. Johnston. That is correct. Would you state briefly
your rile as Assistant to Mr. Helms?
Mr. Karamessines. It was generally to keep abreast of
our operational projects, to review the daily cable and other
traffic for referral to Mr. Helms, and matters of particular
interest to him, to assist him by looking after managerial
problems relating to the general administration of the
Directorate of Plans, and to act in his place when he was
10 away.

12 for Plans?
Mr. Johnston.
Were there any other Assistant Directors
13
Mr. Karamessines.
In the Deputy Directorate for Plans?
14
Mr. Johnsten. That is correct.
15
Mr. Karamessines. No.
16
Mr. Johnston. And did Mr. Helms have an Executive
17
Officer?
:
18
Mr. Karamessines. Yes, he had one or two. But I don't
19
recall who they were at that time.
20
Mr. Johnston.
And would you distinguish your function
21
from theirs?
22
Mr. Karamessines.
Yes. The Executive Officer would
23
have had no command or line responsibility, whereas I did.
24
Mr. Johnston.
Let me go to the period before the
25
assassination of President Kennedy.

And to refresh your memory, Lee Harry Oswald visited
Mexico City in September and early October of 1963, and CIA
surveillance there picked up the fact of his visit to the
Soviet Embassy.
And I want to show you Director Message Number 74830
of 10 October 1963. Principally I am interested in the fact
that on the third page of that you are the authenticating
Officer. And I will give you a chance to perruse the message.
Mr. Karamessines. Actually I am the releasing officer.
Mr. Johnston. You are the releasing officer?
Mr. Karamessine.
That is right. I don't know who some
of the other people here are, because their names are not
listed. The only name that has been left on here is my name
as releasing officer, right?
Mr. Johnston. Right. Then the originating unit is
what on that message?
Mr. Karamessine. WH-3, Mexico.
Mr. Johnston. What you your capacity be as reviewing
officer of that message?
20
Mr. Karamessines. To make sure that it wasn't violating:
21
22
23
any particular policies of ours, particularly since it was
dealing with a man who at least had been American, and might
still be an American.
And we were taking an interest in this
24
fellow even though he wasn't an American. And normally we
25
wouldn't do that, unless there was good reason as there

obviously was in this case, because he had been a Marine, and
had defected, officially defected to the Soviet Union, accord-
ing to this message in 1959.
4
5
6
Mr. Johnston. We are operating with a zerox copy of the
message. But is that a copy of your signature on the third
page?
7
Mr. Karamessines.
Yes.
8
9
10
Mr. Johnston. And with that is it fair to establish
that you at least read the message and knew of the activity
on the date you read the message?
11
Mr. Karamessines.
I read the message. And it concerns
12
a Marine defector to the Soviet Union who apparently, accord-
13
ing to the incoming message to which this was a response,
14
was trying to get in touch with some Soviets or Cubans in
15
Mexico.
That would be the extent of my interest in it at the
16
time.
And I would have ascertained that this certainly was
17
18
a legitimate interest of the CIA in an American, as an
exception to the general rule.
19
Mr. Johnston.
Do you know of any operational interest
20
that the CIA had in Oswald?
21
22
23
24
25
Mr. Karamessines. No, never at any time to my knowledge.
Mr. Johnston. Were you aware that in the fall of 1963
the CIA took an interest in the Fair Play for Cuba Committee?
Mr. Karamessines. I didn't know that.
Mr. Johnston. Were you later aware of it?

Mr. Karamessines. I have seen allegations of that. I

don't know whether that is true or not.
Mr. Johnston. But you had no involvement in any
contemplated action or operation?
Mr. Karamessines. No, absolutely not.
Mr. Johnston. Were you knowledgeable of the CIA progarm
operations directed against Cuba?
Mr. Karamessines. Generally, in very general terms, yes.

Mr. Johnston. And those were run by whom at the time

Mr. Karamessines. They had had the Bay of Pigs the

Mr. Johnston. No, 1961, April and May of 1961.

or if it continued to function as a special staff of some

But it was one or the other.

Mr. Johnston.
Was Mr. Fitzgerald the Head of the Cuban

Division?
22
Mr. Karamessines.
He was at one time, yes, before he
23
became DP at one time, he was in charge, yes.
24
Mr. Johnston. And did he have a unit called the Special

Mr. Johnston. Who had in the fall of 1963 counterintelli-

Mr. Karamessines. General Cuban matters?
Mr. Johnston. Yes.
Mr. Karamessines. Counterintelligence responsibility,

in a case like that, would have been an integral part of the
special Staff, with the assistance and the contribution and

Mr. Johnston. Who coordinated the Special Affairs Staff
counterintelligence withe Counterintelligence Division?
Mr. Karamessines. They just coordinated directly, I
would imagine. I don't think we had an additional officer
appointed to the former coordination function. They would have
been required
normally that would be the SOP to
coordinate their action with the senior Counterintelligence
25
Staff.

Mr. Johnston. Was it SOP for SAS to inform the
2
Counterintelligence Staff of all
Mr. Karamessines. I don't know that. I was not very
4
close to the whole Cuban activity.
It was an activity that had
5
been given birth while I was abroad. And it had its disaster
6
7

9
in late 1961. And I was brought back in 1962 as a DDP in
March. And my guess would be that it was a conscious decision
not to involve me too closely in the remnants of the other
activity.

12
Mr. Johnston. Moving to the assassination of President
Kenney and the day of the assassination, how was the matter
and the problem and the investigation if any, of the assassina-

13
tion handled immediately upon receiving word? Was there any
14
task force created to handle the matter?
15
Mr. Karamessines.
I don't recall the creation of any
16
task force.
But I do remember that because the Counterintelli-

liaison with the other American intelligence security agencies,
especially the FBI, the Secret Service, that the Counterin-
telligence Staff was designated, to my best recollection now,
as the focal point for the receipt of requests for information
from these other agencies, and for responding to those
requests for information. And as a result of that, as far as
I can now recall, all communications going out to Secret
Service or FBI in response to requests for information were

1 prepared by the Counterintelligence Staff, and were either sent
2
directly by that Staff, or if the content warranted, they were

4
myself in his absence.
5
Mr. Johnston. And again, just so that we are clear, when
6
7
you refer to Counterintelligence Staff you are referring to
Mr. Angleton's operation?
8
Mr. Karamessines. Yes, I am.
9
Mr. Johnston. What about the Cuban Counterintelligence
10
Staff, how were they staffed in the investigation?
11
Mr. Karamessines. You mean SAS?
12
Mr. Johnston. Yes.
13
Mr. Karamessine. Which we mentioned earlier?
14
Mr. Johnston. Yes.
15
Mr. Karamessines.
I don't know if they were still in

being at that time. But if they were I don't know the
17
18
19
answer to your question, but my assumption would be that
anything they had to contribute would have been funneled into
the Counterintelligence Staff.
20
Mr. Johnston. Did you ever specifically -- do you
21
recall asking them to make a contribution yourself?
22
Mr. Karamessines. I?

Mr. Karamessines. No, I do not. There may have been,

to Mr. Fitzgerald. But I don't recall seeing any such
instructions.
Mr. Johnston. Did you ever participate in meetings or
see correspondence in which Mr. Helms directed Mr. Angleton
to perform those functions for the Counterintelligence Staff?
Mr. Karamessines. No. But Mr. Angleton certainly was
performing them, and he wouldn't have stepped in to take over
the activity if Mr. Helms hadn't made it plain that that was
12
the way he wanted it handled.
13
Mr. Johnston.
Who was Mr. J. C. King in this era?

Mr. Karamessines.
He was at this time, I believe, the

Chief of the Western Hemisphere Division.

was Jack Whitney?
Mr. Karamessines. Well, I know Jack Whitten as an Officer
of the DDP. But what capacity he was serving in at that
particular point, I don't remember.
Mr. Johnston. Was he at that time involved with SAS?

Mr. Karamessines.
I don't know.

4
Mr. Johnston. Did he have operational control of SAS?
Mr. Karamessines. I don't believe so.
Mr. Johnston. And operational control of SAS was
Mr. Karamessines. It would have been in the nads of the

Director of SAS, Mr. Fitzgerald, who would have been

Mr. Karamessines.
Not to these matters.

Mr. Johnston. We have touched before
16
Mr. Wallach.
Is there a reason why he didn't respond
17
on those matters?
18
Mr. Karamessines.
I had explained before you came in,
19
20
21
22
I think, that I came back here in March of 1962, after the
collapse of the Cuban thing, and the changes that had taken
place, and the place was in a bit of a turmoil. And my
instructions were to look after the day to day business.

Mr. Johnston.

Mr.. Karamessines. My charge from Mr. Helms was that in
view of the turmoil that had been taking place in the Agency,
3 and specifically in the DDP, that we needed more than ever to
4
get back to normál operating, in other words, to bring people
down off the chandaliers.. We had a change of guard, Mr. Bissell
had been removed, and Mr. Dulles had been removed, and Mr.
And
8

Helms had been brought in as Deputy Director for Plans.
the idea there was that we were going to get back to basic,
10
11
12
we were going to be done with some of these high flown ventures
that just get us into trouble, some of these ridiculous things
that had been happening prior to that time.
13
14
When I came back my charge from Helms was, look, you
see the general running of the DDP, the day to day, normal
15
functioning.
We have got Fitzgerald
I think it was
16
Fitzgerald
and he will be worrying about Cuban things.
17
He was a senior officer, don't forget.
When Mr. Helms
18
19
20
went up to the Deputy Director of the Agency, Mr. Fitzgerald
was selected to be the DDP, not I, even though I had been the
Deputy to Mr. Helms.
21
Senator Schweiker.
(Now presiding)
22
When was that that that happened?
23
Mr. Karamessines. 1965.
24
So that my job was to get matters back to the kind of
25
procedures, controls and phase by phase, and step by step

of it.
In 1959 when Mr. Bissell took over he changed a lot of
things. And controls became very loosey goosey. And I think
the Agency and the Clandestine Service suffered quite a bit
from that short but for me devastating interval in the history
(
10
11
But what Helms tried to do was get this thing back on
track. And I was supposed to help him do this. That is why
12
he brought me back, when my tour of duty was nearly up.
13
Senator Schweiker.
You were excluded from the chain of
14
command?
15
Mr. Karamessines.
It was simply made clear that this
16
17
was a Special Staff whose only job would be this, and I
didn't have to be all that concerned about it. That didn't
18
19
20
21
22
mean that I couldn't know what was happening there if I wanted
to know. But I had my hands absolutely full with things that
I had to deal with myself. And here was a very senior fellow
with a staff of his own dealing with just this special thing,
which was an outgrowth and a result, or whatever you want to
23
24
25
call it, of the Cuban operations, which I knew nothing about..
Senator Schweiker. And how did the White House
coordination or liaison go with that Special Affairs Section?

Kennedy. But I wasn't there.
Mr. Johnston. Let me continue with the Special Affa:
Staff. Did they also have responsibility for the Cuban ex:
groups and the operations of Cuban exiles?
Mr. Karamessines.
Yes, they did, that was all part :
their ball of wax.
Senator Schweiker.
Like Alpha 66, would that have been
under them?
Mr. Karamessines. Anything relating to operations
directly or indirectly suppored by the CIA against the Castro
Government, landing agents, small boat infiltrations,
screening fellows down in Miami, working with the Immigrati
and Nationalization, FBI, very closely. All of this was SA.
with the help of the Counterintelligence Staff as required.
Mr. Wallach. On the other side of the coin, what about
the question of Cuba's operations vis-a-vis the US? Was that
also out of SAS?

forget, had to protect itself against the activity of the DGI,
the Cuban Intelligence Service. And we knew that the DGI
was very active, particularly in Canada, in sending fellows
down into the States as agents through Canada. And ever so
often SAS, through its activities in Miami would pick up
reflections of DGI activities and report these of course into
Counterintelligence and the FBI.
Mr. Johnston. Let's go back to the investigation of the
assassination. Do you recall the incident with Sylvia Dura,
who was the Mexican employed by the Cuban Embassy in Mexico
City?
Mr. Karamessines. From the Cuban Consulate?
17
Mr. Johnston. The Cuban Consolate, that is correct.
18
Do you recall that you received information that Sylvi
19
Dura was going to be arrested by Mexican authorities?
20
21
22
23
24
Mr. Karamessines. Yes, I have a recollection of that.
I don't recall the circumstances, but that rings a bell, if
that is what you mean. And she was going to be arrested and
questioned, is that right?
25
Mr. Johnston. That is correct.

Mr. Karamessines. For our account, if I recall co
correctly, is that right?
Mr. Johnston. That is less clear, as to your account.
Mr. Karamessines. I see.
Mr. Johnston. My question is, first of all, were you

ever told or do you know whether Sylvia Dura was a contact for

the Agency?

I have no knowledge and do not believe she was ever a con-

Senator Schweiker.
Let's ask the same question of
Alvarado.
Mr. Karamessines.
He was that nut that you mentioned
earlier that came in and gave them a tall story which turned
out to be false.
Senator Schweiker. Was he ever an informer or source of
16
information?
17
Mr. Karamessines.
The answer is no as far as anything
18
I over heard from anybody.
19
Mr. Johnston.
Do you recall ordering Mr. Whitten to call

Dura?
Mr. Karamessines. Do I recall ordering Mr. Whitney to
call it off?
Mr. Johnston. Yes.

Mr. Karamessines. No, I don't recall that. Are you
sure I ordered him to call off the arrest? Maybe somebody
else did. I don't recall any such thing. I don't recall
anybody ordering it.
Mr. Johnston. Let me show you, then, a cable which
apparently was sent out after by way of background, prior
to this cable going out, Mexico City had cabled and said,
Mexican police have already arrested Dura, so we can't call
off her arrest.
Mr. Karamessines. I see.
Mr. Johnston. And then this cable followed, Director
84916 of 20 November 1963.
Mr. Karamessines. Yes.
Mr. Johnston. Who originated that cable?
Mr. Karamessines. The origin of this cable it looks
like it came from the Mexican Branch of the WH Division. I
notice that the CI Staff is on distribution.
Senator Schweiker.
Who was Head of the Mexican Branch?
Mr. Karamessines.
I don't recall at this point.
Senator Schweiker.
Wasn't David Phillips working down
there at the time?
Mr. Karamessines.
I don't recall. You can get that,
I am
sure, very easily from the Agency. I certainly can't
recall who was in charge of the Mexican Branch at that time.
Senator Schweiker. On the structure of operations the

way that you were structured then, would the Head of the
Mexico City Branch have reported to whom under your procedures?

Mr. Karamessines. To the Director of the Western

Hemisphere Division, the Chief of the Western Hemisphere
Division, who as J. C. King.

Mr. Johnston. And he would have reported to whom?

Mr. Karamessines.
And he would have reported to Mr.

Helms, or in his absence, to me.
9
Mr. Johnston.
In other words, it would go to Mr. Helms
10
unless you were acting in this capacity?
11
Mr. Karamessines.
That is right, he was the DDP at that

time.
