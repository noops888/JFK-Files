1. Reference is made to our memorandum of 11 July 1961,
captioned as above and also to our letter dated 2 June 1961
addressed to the Director, National Security Agency, with copy to the
Deputy Director, Central Intelligence Agency, subject:
"MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION CONCERNING".
2. The following information supplements the material on
Nicholas Georges DAMASCOU or DAMASKOU or DAMAKOU or
DAMASCUS reported in paragraph 2 of our 11 July 1961 memorandum.
Our representatives in Lebanon advised that
Nicholas Georges DAMASCOU
DAMASCO or DAMASCUS arrived in Alexandria, Egypt and also
Sydney, Australia in October 1960 aboard the S.S. STRATNAVER,
arriving in Sydney, Australia on 8 March 1960. At the
time of his arrival in Sydney, DAMASCOU was in possession of
an Australian visa No. 1371 issued in Cairo on 18 July 1956. He was
described as follows: 5'10", normal build, normal complexion,
dark brown eyes, black hair, occupation "writer". He departed Australia
on 28 May 1960 aboard the S.S. CRENSHAW, destination not indicated
and as of 18 July 1961 had not re-entered Australia.
Our representatives in Mexico City meanwhile had
learned that Anastasia Georges DAMASCOU or DAMASCUS, sister of
the above, on 8 July 1960 applied at the Mexican Consulate in
350 Antonio, Tamaulipas, for a Mexican Tourist Card to enter Mexico to visit
her brother Nicholas George DAMASCOU, then residing at the Hotel
SECRET
New York office of her
Free form in Mexico City, at the time of her arrival, but that an entry
permit, she received confirmation awaiting her. The entry
Government approved her entry visa application but she delayed deposit
of the $1000 pesos bond, as guarantee of her intention to depart
Mexico upon expiration of her tourist card and duration
files contain no record of her actual arrival in Mexico missing
approval of her 8 July 1960 application. The most recent correspondence
on this case is contained in Mexico City files in early 1961,
selecting that Anastasia DAMASCO again requested a Tourist Card
on or about the date of the letter, at which time her address in the
United States was given as c/o Mexican Coast Bar, Astralo, Texas.
In reply to her second application as an entry permit,
the authorities again replied with a request that she post a bond to insure
of $10,000 Pesos, to guarantee departure from Mexico upon expiration of
her tourist visa. There is no further information currently available
on her further travel plans.
With reference to Nicholas Georges DAMASCOU, on basis
of the information reported in preceding paragraphs, a check by our
representatives with officials of the United States Embassy in Mexico
City revealed that Nicholas Georges DAMASCOU, born 18 March 1931 in
Alexandria, Egypt, holder of Greek Passport 1961 issued in
Alexandria, Egypt on 8 March 1961 and valid to 10 April 1961, with
address of 6 Elizabeth King Road, Elizabeth Bay, Sydney, Australia
was the recipient of a United States Visa on 29 October 1960. On his
application, DAMASCOU indicated that he desired to visit the United
States for a period of four months, described as a pleasure trip to visit
his sister. The visa application did not include any destination address
in the United States. It is also noted that the visa card maintained on
Nicholas DAMASCOU in the Embassy in Mexico City contains a notation
by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, Los Angeles,
May 29, 1961.
Through a reliable confidential source our representatives
in Egypt had learned in the interim that Nicholas DAMASCOU, who
is identical with the individual described in preceding paragraphs,
currently resides in Los Angeles, California, at 1100 North Gardner,
Apartment 11, and that he advised his mother and younger brother,
still residing in Alexandria, that he plans to marry the daughter of an
American official, who is not further identified. The same source
also advised that Georges DAMASCOU aka DAMASKOU, father of
Nicholas and Anastasia DAMASCOU aka DAMASCUS, died during the
course of 1960. Following the demise of the father, Angelika
SECRET
DAMASCOU, to accompany a younger son not identified by name, had
planned to emigrate from Egypt to join her son Nicholas in the United
States. However, prior to the finalization of these plans, Angelika
DAMASCOU herself a state of details concerning which are not
clear, but she is reported as of this writing still ill, disabled and
obviously unable to travel. No further information was available on
the possible future emigration plans of Angelika DAMASCOU aka
GAVOURAS and/or of her unidentified younger brother of Nicholas
DAMASCOU and of Anastasia DAMASCOU.
On basis of the reported filing of an application for a
United States Visa in July 1956 at the U.S. Embassy in London by
Anastasia DAMASCOU, our representatives in London were requested
to initiate checks on indices in the names of Nicholas and of
Anastasia DAMASCOU. It was advised that as of late July 1961, they held
no trace on Anastasia DAMASCOU, but they were continuing to check her
possible presence in London during 1956, based on the reported visa
application data. It was further advised that they held no trace on either
Nicholas George DAMASCOU aka DAMASCO aka DAMASCUS or on
his sister Anastasia George DAMASCOU.
It is suggested that the indices of the Department of State's
Visa Section, as well as the indices of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, Department of Justice, may contain further detailed
information on the current immigration status, whereabouts in the
United States, and also the residence in the United States of Nicholas
Georges DAMASCOU aka DAMASCUS or Anastasia Georges DAMASCOU
aka DAMASCO, and any other members of the family who may have
applied for entry visas from abroad.
With regard to Juett GILBRA Casarne, mentioned in above
referenced memorandum of 17 July 1961, in contact of Nicholas
DAMASCOU aka DAMASCUS, it is suggested that the indices of the
Department of State may contain additional information on his activities
during his service as the Mexican Embassy in Washington, D.C.
