Action Requested: See para, 4 and 5.
1. AMTHIP/3 telephoned Bunce on 12 November 1965 and announced
his presence in town. A luncheon date was set for 17 November,
when the following information was obtained.
2. Asked about Max INTRATOR (201-3001/3), AMWHIP/2 said that
he is still barred from entering France or England but that through
the intercession of the Swiss Ambassador in Cuba the ban on his
entering Switzerland has been lifted. Asked about INTRATOR's
current income or financial standing, AMWHIP/2 said that he does
fairly well but does not enjoy a large income. He added that
Ambassador Antonio Maria CARRILLO Carreras (201-549956) had told
him that the Cuban regime does not trust INTRATOR as far as they
can throw him. His function is to arrange for the purchase by the
regime of arms manufacturing plants which can be transported to Cuba
and assembled there. He buys for goods rather than cash.
3. AMWHIP/1 and AMWHIP/3 were together in Paris on 13 October
1965 (presumably for a few days before and/or after this date).
While there they saw CARRILLO, from whom they purchased $1,000
worth of jewelry, almost all of it junk.
4. In Paris on 13 October AMWHIP/1 and AMWHIP/2 met the fru
IGLESIAS who appears in (OIRA 37855, 7 August 1964, AM 9) He is
trusted by the regime and used by it as an emissary. AMWHIP/2
says that IGLESIAS, formerly the owner of the largest jewelry
stores in Havana, is an upright man. (Station Comment: Further
information on IGLESIAS, particularly his first name, is urgently
needed. A query to JMRAVE would be helpful.) IGLESIAS made the
following statement about the heirlooms shipped:
"HONZALENEH was smuggled to Havana by Tommaso FATTORINI,
