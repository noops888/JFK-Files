For several years Tuya Cuban Express was favored with your air shipments
to Cuba. In 1960, due to the communist take-over, and the. the imprisonment of
my father and me, our ope rations were discontinued. Today, we are engaged
in the struggle against communism through "Comandos L", and I come to ask
for your support.
11
Comandos "L" was created in 1962 by a group of freedom-loving Cubans, most
of them businessmen and professionals, with no personal or political ambi-
tions other than the liberation of Cuba. Their efforts and accomplishments
were clearly di sclosed by LIFE magazine of April 12th, 1963, whose front
cover displayed a memorable drawing of the attack on the Russian Ship Baku.
I am convinced that victory over communism can be achieved if we recognize...
that the international communist conspiracy is waging total war against us,
and that the re-establishment of democracy in Cuba is the greatest contribu-
tion we can make now to the sacred cause of world peace, a cause for which
many members of of Comandos "L" have given their lives
M

Stand with Comandos "L". Give us your spiritual support and your financial
aid now. Your contribution will help provide the solid financial backing neede
to wage our war against communism, today firmly entrenched only 90 miles
from your shores.
With best personal regards, Iremain
Sincerely yours,
TUYA CUBAN EXPRESS
