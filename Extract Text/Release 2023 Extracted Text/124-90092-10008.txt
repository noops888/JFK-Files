Reference is made to your letter dated March 28, 1949 wherein
you advise that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police nad received information
indicating that the Central Intelligence Agency desire to place a representa-
tive in Ottawa. You requested any comments the Bureau might be able to make
relative to this matter
As you know, the Bureau, of course, can make no objection to the
establishment of such liaison. For your confidential information, information has
been received at the Seat of Govemment reflecting that such a CIA liaison repre-
sentative will be placed in Canada ithin the next few weeks Officials of CIA
have confidentially advised the Bureau's liaison section that they readily
eland
(U) recognize that it will take years to build up a close liaison with the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police and related organizations. They state, however, that
they feel such action must be taken in view of CIA's jurisdiction in foreign
circles
(U)
For your further information, it has been ascertained confidentially
that CIA is presently considering one Samuel Herman Horton former Bureau
Agent and now an employee of the Office of Special Operations, CIA, for the position
is questioned. Horton entered the Bureau as a Special Agent on January 15, 1940.
He was assigned to the Richmond and Cincinnati Offices and was transferred to
the Seat of Government on June 28, 1943. He resigned on December 17, 1944, to
accept a position with the Office of Strategic Services.

This is being brought to you for your attention so that you may be
completely aware of the situation. You should be particularly alert to prevent
being used as a "stepping stone" for CIR or (Horton CIA should develop its
own contacts without depending on the excellent relationships, al ready
established between the FBI and Canadianfficial channels. Only that
liaison necessary for the coordination of domestic and foreign matters is
necessary & it should be most circumspect.
