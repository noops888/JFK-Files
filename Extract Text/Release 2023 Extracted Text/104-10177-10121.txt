Termination of Paul D. LANGEVIN
HER: SAGO 903 dated 10 October 1953
1. Attached are a) statement of termination signed by subject
and b) agent's service record. Submision of these items
has been delayed pending receipt of Field Instruction 236-1.
Since this instruction has not been received we are submitting
the enclosures to close the record on this case.
2.
Paul D. LANGEVIN may be used for recruiting tasks before his
permanent departure from Chile in April 1954. His security
is not questioned and he has expressed a willingness to per-
form such tasks..
3. He also requests arrangements for the payment of income tax
on his earnings ouring 1953. This matter will be handled
by cable in view of time element.
4. The following explains the timing of LANGEVIN's termination:
he had been advised that he would be terminated one month
after all advances had been liquidaten. This would have
• been 30 September 1953. This ante was also chosen since
it was expected that COALIUS would take over FURIOS0 "C"
at about that time. COKONTUS did take over the project.
early in October. However, LANG VIN dia no work during the
month of September for which he would be entitled to pay-
ment, althoum he presumably was available for duty. The
last payment of 357.44 for the Leriod 1 through 31 August
195 was in addition to the liquidation or his avances
although it did not cover a over a full month fror the cate of
such liquidat on which must have occuried sometime in August.
LANGEVIN accepted this as the ist payment coming to him số
there did not seem to be any vointi forcing another $500

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH Division
SUBJECT
: Mr. David A. Phillips
1. The attached dispatch from the Chief of Station, Beirut,
covers the proposed resignation of Mr. David A. Phillips from
CIA. The matter was discussed with the Chief of Station during
his recent visit to Headquarters, and he feels that Mr. Phillips'
decision to return to South America is irrevocable.
2. Mr. Phillips, as you are aware, was in Havana until the
spring of 1957, at which time he accepted a staff agent position
in Beirut. His primary responsibility was the establishment of
a radio and television production center in addition to providing

responsibilities of his Beirut assignment.
3. The Chief of Station indicated that Mr. Phillips did a
highly commendable job while in Beirut and feels his departure
from the Middle East is regrettable; however, he was unable to
dissuade Mr. Phillips from his desires to leave CIA. Headquarters
has been equally impressed by Mr. Phillips' services and feels
he performed in an exemplary manner, utilizing his mature judgment

SUBJECT: Future Resignation from CIA of David Phillips
1. In a recent meeting with the Chief of Station, David Phillips, the
PECTATE case officer, informally announced his intention of resigning from
CIA in the near future. At that time Phillips requested that Headquarters
be informed by the Chief of Station. The decision to resign has been made
informally, in order for the Station and Headquarters to have as much ad-
vance notice as possible. Actually, Phillips does not expect to leave his
Beirut assignment for about four months, or sometime in the month of July.
Phillips reports that the PECTATE building will have been finished and oc-
cupied by PECTATE staffers long before that time.
2. In the above-mentioned meeting, and in a Memorandum for the Record
submitted to the Chief of Station, Fhillips has emphasized that his decision
was reached after careful though and has been prompted solely by personal
considerations. Specifically the reasons are:
a. The necessity of Phillips return to Latin America to take
care of personal business problems, mainly the sale of his newspaper
in Chile. He has been negotiating for this sale for many months,
but he feels that an advantageous agreement would be impossible to
reach by mail from such a distance.
b. Phillips' desire to inaugurate a business firm in Cuba.
3. The Chier of Station has discussed this matter with Phillips in
detail. Phillips has reiterated--and has requested that Headquarters be so
advised--that his decision is purely personal. There is no question of dis-
satisfaction with CIA, or of a morale problem. On the contrary, Phillips
has expressed his regret that circumstances prompt him to terminate what
he has described as a most rewarding association with CIA.
4. Phillips' plans for leaving the Beirut assignment bring up the
problem of future CIA control of PECTATE. Phillips has submitted to the
Chief of Station his personal recommendations on this score, which have been
considered in prepering a separate dispatch.
