Reference is made to your letter dated March 10,
1965, your file 146-12-3212, and to our letter dated
March 15, 1965, both concerning the captioned case.
The matter, as outlined in your letter, was
discussed with Harry Zerbell, Economic Officer, United States
Embassy, Mexico City, Mexico, on March 16, 1965, by our
Legal Att
Attache there.
Zerbell advised that approximately three weeks
ago he was informed that a representative of the United States
Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas would come to
Mexico and contact him for the purpose of discussing this
case and the possibility of obtaining the documents referred
to in your letter. Zerbell stated that as of March 16, 1965,
the United States Attorney's representative had not come to
Mexico.
Zerbell was of the opinion that it would be
premature at this time for our Legal Attache to contact
the Attorney General of Mexico and he requested that we
take no action in this regard until he receives additional
instructions from the United States Department of Commerce
and from the aforementioned United States Attorney's office.
In view of the foregoing and in the absence of a
specific request from you, we plan to take no further action
in-this matter at this time.

Mr. Herbert J. Miller, Jr.
Assistant Attorney General
NOTE:
:
Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, by
letter 3/10/65, requested our assistance in securing information
from Mexican Government in connection with a case being handled
by Department. Subjects in violation of embargo shipped American-
made automotive parts from Texas to Mexico and subsequently to
Cuba. Cortez, who is President of Transcontinental S. A., was
granted prosecutive immunity and is scheduled to be a key
Government witness. He told USA for Eastern District of Texas
that certain documents of his firm would serve as corroborative
evidence. Cortez's firm, however, has been liquidated and
liquidator has declined to show records to U. S. Government
representatives. AAG, in referenced letter, indicated that he
was aware our Legat was in contact with AG of Mexico on almost
daily basis and requested that we have our Legat request AG of
Mexico to persuade liquidator to make his records available.
AAG suggested we have our Legat contact Harry Zerbell, referred
to above.
In addition to information in this letter, Zerbell
confidentially told Legat that someone in Washington sometime
ago approached CIA about obtaining instant documents as CIA
in Mexico City has clandestine means of obtaining documents
if necessary. Legat advised A of Mexico personally known to
him and would probably be cooperative in attempting toobtain
documents providing framework of Mexican law would permit him to
do so.
