Background:
a On 8 January 1976, Mr. Richard D. Mahoney
requested a mandatory review of two classified CỦA
documents under provisions of Executive Order 11652
Section 5(C). The documents were in custody of
the National Archives and Records Service (NARS)
in the John F. Kennedy Library.

Mahoney's request with copies of the documents to
CIA. The Agency was asked to review the documents.
If declassified, they were to be marked appropriately.

If they remained classified, the Agency was
requested to cite the applicable exemption
category from Section 5(R) of the E.C. and
a date when automatic declassification may be
accomplished. They requested that the copies
of the documents be returned with the Agency's
response.
c. On 26 July 1976, IPS wrote to the
NARS and returned copies of the documents.
Both documents were found to require continued classt-
fication under 6.0. 11652 Section 5(B).

to the CIA and appealed the decision to with-

request.

Recommendations:
3. Tah B-2 contains TDCSDB 3/657,851 dated
12 November 1963. During the initial review, the
document was denied in toto to requester under
provision 5(R) (2) of E.O. 11652, as amended. The
document is based on ACL-1832 dated 10 November
1963. I recommend that the initial determination
to deny the document to the requester in toto
under provision 5(B)(2) of E.O. 11652, as amended,
be sustained and that provision S(B) (3) of E.Ο.
11652 now be applied. The information is from
a sensitive source with unique access to a poli-
tical leader. If released, the information could
cause embarrassment to the United States Govern-
ment and exacerbate relations with a friendly
foreign government.
b. During the DDO appeals review, a classifi-
cation review was conducted. The document is
properly classified and properly marked in accordance
with the provisions of E.O. 11652,
as amended.
Due to the sensitivity of the subject matter, a
meaningful sanitization cannot be made.

Backgromal:
i
a. Richard Doyle Mahon oney, a membe member of the the public
who is identified as a researcher, initiated on

a mandatory review of TDCSDB-5/656,740 98 accordance

b. IPS responded to HARS on 24 June 1976.
Among other things, CIA denied in toto TOCSDE-

reply stated that the document had to remain
Classified indefinitely in order to protect
intelligence sources and methods, and stated
that release of segregable portions was not
feasible. This was based upon a classification
review by a knowledgeable officer with experience
in French-African affairs, dated 24 May 1976.
c. Mr. Richard Doyle Mahoney appealed this
determination directly to IPS in a letter dated
22 September 1976. He specifically asked if
it would not be possible to release a sanitized
version of the document without jeopardizing
national security.
3. Recommendations:
a. See the Appeals Review Forms for specific
detailed recommendations.
b. A second classification review was requested
by DDO/ISS/PICG. The second review was conducted
on TDCSDB-3/656,740 on 22 December 1976 by Europe
Division, which decided to retain the classification
at Secret in accordance with E.O. 11652. Europe
Division determined after review that there were
foreign policy and liaison sensitivities which
precluded downgrading TDCSDB-3/656,740, or
sterilizing the document and releasing portions
thereof, at this time.

She provided some biographic information and asked
that any fees be waived.
b. On 15 December 1975, IPS/DDA advised DDO

c. On 19 March 1976, IPS wrote to

three of which were DDO documents. Deletions had
been made under (b) (1), (b)(3), and (b) (6) of the
FOIA. Two additional DDO documents (those referred
by the FBI) were denied in toto under the same
exemptions. The exemptions were explained, the
denying officials were identified by name, and
was advised of her right to appeal.
was also advised that FBI and INS ori-
ginated material was being referred to the FBI and
INS for their direct response to her request.
[N.B. When IPS listed the four documents they
erroneously listed the Deputy Director of Security
as denying document 1 and Chief, Services Staff
as responsible for documents 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
In fact, the Deputy Director of Security was the
denying official of document 4 and Chief, Services
Staff for documents 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. OGC should
point out and correct this error in their letter
to requester].
d. In an undated letter received by CIA on
26 April 1976,
appealed the decisions
pursuant to subsection (a) (6) of the FOIA.

Recommendations:
3. Tah B-2 contains TDCSDB 3/657,851 dated
12 November 1963. During the initial review, the
document was denied in toto to requester under
provision 5(R) (2) of E.O. 11652, as amended. The
document is based on ACL-1832 dated 10 November
1963. I recommend that the initial determination
to deny the document to the requester in toto
under provision 5(B)(2) of E.O. 11652, as amended,
be sustained and that provision S(B) (3) of E.Ο.
11652 now be applied. The information is from
a sensitive source with unique access to a poli-
tical leader. If released, the information could
cause embarrassment to the United States Govern-
ment and exacerbate relations with a friendly
foreign government.
b. During the DDO appeals review, a classifi-
cation review was conducted. The document is
properly classified and properly marked in accordance
with the provisions of E.O. 11652,
as amended.
Due to the sensitivity of the subject matter, a
meaningful sanitization cannot be made.

2. (U) Background:
a. Subject submitted a request under FOIA, on
22 March 1976, for any and all information the Agency
held on "A Quaker Action Group" also known as "AQAG."
In the 20 July 1976 initial response, 24 newspaper
clippings and one leaflet were released to him; two
documents were denied.
b. On 23 August 1976 Subject appealed, requesting
that further information be released to him on the group.
c. During the appeals review 11 additional documents
were located and are included in the recommendations
below. These documents were not considered during the initial
review since they were not considered to meet the criteria
for "records" extant at that time and they contained only
incidental references to the subject of the request.
d. During the appeals review we were unable to
identify any Air Force documents concerning the subject
of this request. The requester should be told that this
was apparently an error.
e. During the appeals review we were unable to
identify any Department of State documents concerning
A Quaker Action Group. Two State documents located, and
possibly referred to in the initial response, do not
concern A Quaker Action Group. The requestor should be
informed that this was also apparently an error.
3. (C) Recommendations:
a. My specific recommendations are shown on the
Appeals Review Form attached to each document. A
classification review has been conducted and all documents
are considered properly classified and marked in accordance
with E.O. 11652, as amended.
b.. I recommend that the two documents denied in toto
under the initial review continue to be denied. One of
them (Tab 3) could identify a still active and sensitive
source. The other (Tab 4) was obtained through a sensitive
operation conducted jointly by American and German
authorities.

c. I recommend that portions of ten additional
documents located during the appeals review be released
Excaptions (b)(1), (b)(3) and (b)(6) should be cited,
as applicable, to the denied portions. Specific
recommendations on each of these documents is reflected
in the attached Appeals Review Forms. (Tabs 5-14).
d. One additional document located during the
appeals review should be denied in toto, since it was
received from a foreign liaison service. (Tab 15).
e. 88 FRI documents located during the initial
review, but not referred to the FBI, should be referred
to the FBI in writing for review and direct response.
These documents are listed under Tab 16.
f. One Department of the Army document should be
referred in writing to them for review and direct response
The title page and a description of the document are
attached as Tab 17.
g. Five items from NSA have been referred to them by
IFS for review. (
