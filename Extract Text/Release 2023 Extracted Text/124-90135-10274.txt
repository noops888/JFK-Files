wife is Su-shuei LING who arrived in Europe by air from
New York on 12/13/60 and proceeded to Madrid, Spain. His
New York address, as of October, 1960, was in care of Michel
Bernier, 514 West 110th Street, New York City.

Spain, where he works on American bases. He is a repre-
sentative of Lang Chong and Company, Custom Tailors, Second
Floor, OiKwan Building, Lottingen Street, Hong Kong. The

and both are members of a financial organization established
by the authorities of People's Bank at Shanghai for the purpose
of obtaining capital of Chinese living abroad and channeling
these funds back into China.

The subject is known to have been in contact with
Heinz Theodor Wiener who reportedly was arrested on a

Michael Bernier, 514 West 110th Street, New York City. This informa-
tion was furnished by CIA which has conducted extensive and penetrating
interview of Saiyed abroad. The information furnished by Saiyed has
been discounted because he not only is an admitted fraudulent check
passer, but is also a self-admitted fabricator of intelligence infor-
motion.
