PROJECT LIFEAT
PROJECT REVIEW
I. Product of the Project
A. Soviet Coverage
Project LIFEAT has not provided coverage of the entire Soviet official
installation in Mexico City since 22 June 1960 when Project LIENVOY
assumed this responsibility. This freed LIFEAT to provide, with its
unilateral coverage, home phones of selected Soviet officials which
could better support not only the Station's CE effort but also other
Station operations against the Soviet target. In this effort, LIFEAT
covered the homes of four of the more active Soviet Intelligence
Officers stationed in Mexico during the reporting period. Samples
of the operational information provided by LIFEAT follows:
HMM-6479, 15 June 1962 (Mexican Winners of Soviet Scholarships
to Patrice Lamumba University)
ΗΜΜΑ-19826, 21 September 1962 (Transmittal of LIFEA? Report
Vladilan I. SAMOKHIN)
ΗΜΜΑ-19839, 21 September 1962 (Transmittal of LIFEAT Report

ΗΜΜΑ-19879, 28 September 1962 (Aleksandr G. SIDOROV Tatiaya
SOKOLOVSKAYA)
ΗΜΜΑ-19996, 12 October 1962 (Soviet Personnel Assigned to Mexico
City)
B. LIFEAT has remained a primary source on this target throughout the
past project year. Further, LIFEAT information is considered a
fruitful source of operational leads by the responsible Case Officer.
Selected examples of the valuable intelligence product derived from
the Polish coverage are:
ΗΜΜΑ-19500, 3 August 1962 (БECHICK Telecon)

C. Yugoslav Coverage
LIFEAT coverage of the Yugoslav official installation in Mexico City
has provided a wealth of information on the contacts, activities, and
travel of members of that mission. Since the Station's effort against
this target was greatly increased within the last year, LIFEAT infor-
mation has been used extensively to provide the basic operational and
personality data necessary for this stepped-up program. Examples of
LIFEAT produced positive intelligence and general operational informa-
tion on this target are as follows:
ΗΜΜΑ-19311, 10 July 1962 (Activity of the CP of Yugoslavia in
Mexico City)
ΗΜΜΑ-19344, 13 July 1962 (Yugoslav Embassy Mexico City)
ΗΜΜΑ-19653, 24 August 1962 (Miodrag RADOVIC)

Yugoslavia)
ΗNM-7011, 12 February 1963 (Possibility of New Mexican-Yugoslav

HMM-7106, 19 March 1963 (Yugoslav Project to Promote Economic
Helations with Mexico)

HMM-7310, 24 May 1963 (Plan for Tito to sign New Mexican-Yugoslav
Cultural Agreement During his visit to Mexico)
D. Cuban Coverage
During the reporting period LIFEAT coverage of the Cuban target was
directed toward the support of KUBARK operations in this field and was
not designed to provide positive intelligence. LIFEAT covered a total
of 10 lines in direct support of operations in this field. Most of
the product of this area of operation was forwarded by cable to JWAVE
and Headquarters. Examples of pouch communications in this field are:
ΗΜΑ-20032, 16 October 1962 (AMSTRUT/LIFEAT Coverage)
ΗΜΜΑ-20308, 4 December 1962 (AMSTRUT)

E. American Communist Group in Mexico (ACGM)
As noted in past project reviews, most of the targets in this group
have been covered at the request of QUENVY, and the raw take has been
processed by them. During the period July 1962 through May 1963
approximately 390 reels of take were passed to the local ODENVY for
their processing. On 23 August 1962 the local ODENVY advised, "This
office feels the coverage mentioned is quite valuable and many useful
leads are obtained from this coverage, particularly with regard to
travel in and out of Mexico of American Communists who are in contact
with individuals on whom coverage is maintained". Typical examples
of reporting based on LIFEAT coverage of the ACGM are:
HANA-19531, 10 August 1962 (Albert MALTZ, Noah SEBORER, Charles
SMALL)
ΗΜΜΑ-19678, 24 August 1962 (Albert NALTZ-Margaret MALTZ)
ΗΜΜΑ-19771, 7 September 1962 (Albert MALTZ and Charles SMALL)
ΗΜΜΑ-20937, 22 March 1963 (Albert MALTZ, Noah SEBORER, Charles
SMALL
ΗΜΜΑ-21299,7 May 1963 (Charles SMALL and Noah SEBORER)
F. Exile and Revolutionary Activities
During the past year this area of activity, in addition to the already
noted Cuban coverage, accounted for the greatest percentage of the
LIFEAT effort. Most of the information provided by LIFEAT in its
coverage of targets in this area was not available from other sources.
While Coverage has been provided on Spanish Republican, Guatemalan,
Costa Rican, and Nicaraguan exiles, the bulk of this product has
resulted from the coverage of Juan Jose AREVALO Bermejo and various of
his acquaintances, the "take" being forwarded to Headquarters and Station
Guatemala by either weekly cable summaries or immediate action cables
when warranted. It is noted that the coverage has been most rewarding
in the case of AREVALO and the recent coverage of Judith FERRETO Segura.
Examples of productivity in this area:

G. Counter-Intelligence Information
Mexico City Station's Related Mission Directive places greatest
emphasis on operations in the CI/CE area. LIFEAT was able to provide
a continuing worthwhile contribution in the attainment of the Station's
objectives in this field. Coverage included that on AFGENERATE, Carlos
Humbert ILLESCAS (who acts in the capacity as covert liaison link
between the CP and the Soviet Embassy), and a PCM safe house. In
addition to the continuing operational support in the CI/CE field, the
following informational reporting was provided.

H. Operational Support and Leads Provided other Station Operations
During the past project year LIFEAT continued actively supporting the
operations of Mexico City Station through the production of leads and
the providing of information on selected targets in the manner available
only through the use of a unilateral telephone tap operation. Indeed,
it is in this area, secure support to the Station's operations, that
LIFEAT is of greatest and unique value to the Station. The following
is a list of selected contributions by LIFEAT of operational support
and leads provided to the various Station Case Officers and Station
operations as a whole:
SECRET/
5
LIFEAT/Soviet: The valuable assistance which LIFEAT rendered Station
efforts in this area was amis displayed in its support of Station
assets mounting a technical surveillance operation targeted against
the home of a known Soviet intelligence officer stationed in Mexico
City under official cover, LIFSAT information provided vital infor-
mation which enabled the Station to establish a pattern of action,
of both the family of the Soviet officer and his maid. This infor-
mation made possible the setting of a time for the actual entry into
the target, and continuing coverage (including live monitoring of the
target line immediately preceeding the operation) by LIFEAT made
possible a degree of security for this operation which would not have
been possible without the support of a unilateral tap operation.
Further LIFEAT coverage has, in addition to giving information on
the daily activities and contacts of Soviet officials, provided an ex-
cellent check on the contacts of three KURARK controlled double agents
with their Soviet Case Officers. This coverage has enabled the respon-
sible Case Officer to guide his operations with increased assurance
that his agents continue to be fully cooperative and under his control.
LIFEAT/Cuban: LIFEAT activities in this area were concerned primarily
with support to the AMSTRUT operation. Coverage of relatives of
AMSTRUT-2 provided an excellent "window" into the operation which
enabled the responsible Case Officers to move with more certainty
and security in developing this operation. The Case Officers involved
considered the LIFEAT coverage an essential check on the activities of
the principals in the case which was especially valuable during the
initial stages of the operation, Travel plans of ANSTRUT-2 provided
by LIFEAT were also essential to the timing of the operation. Also
in the Cuban area LIFEAT coverage of 0-2 agent enabled the Station
to gain an insight into his contacts and activities. Further, recent
initiation of coverage of a Cuban Commercial Official gives evidence
of producing solid information of commercial transactions and Mexican
Commercial contacts of the Cuban Government.
LIFEAT/Polish: LIFEAT continued its coverage in the REKNAVE/BECHICK
operation. (See previous project renewal for background of this case
and the LIFEAT participation in it.) of great interest to this operation
was LIFFAT information indicating that the wife of BERNAVE had become
aware of his interest in another woman, and later revelation of reassign-
ment and travel plans of BERNATE.
SECRET
6
LIFFAT/Yugoslavs In addition to the usual information concerning
the Yugoslav officials and their daily contacts and activities,
LIPEAT provided leads which could pay off in future operations.
One example was a lead weich. revealed that a diplomatic courier
would be travelling alone and taking a new travel route while
carrying an official pouch. With this early warning, the Station
was able to plan an operation to provide access to this correspon-
derice. Although Headquarters finally vetoed this particular oper-
ation, sufficient early warning was given by LINEAT so that the
operation could have been carried out. Another example of this
type of lead was the data available from LIFFAT coverage that a
new location was being sought for the Yugoslav Embassy, and which
specific iocations were under consideration. Armed with this informa-
tion the Station has been able to make a technical casing of one of
the prospective sites and obtain information necessary for entry into
the other sites.
LIFEAT/Exile: As noted previously, LIHEAT coverage of the exile
activities was the single major effort by LIFEAT during the project
year. In particular, LIFEAT coverage of Juan Jose AREVALO Bormojo,
which included lengthy periods of "livo-monitoring", on occasion
called for coverage of five lires. Cabled summaries of LIFEAT
information were provided Headquarters and Station Guatemala. It
is believed that the importance of this LIFEAT coverage can not be
stressed too much. LIFEAT Coverage of a Costa Rican Communist exile
resident in Mexico City has lead to a wealth of operational leada
including the discovery of this person's envolvement in a Communist
funding mechanics. Also, LIFFAT was active in covering the Spanish
Republican exile community in Mexico City during the GPIDEAL visit
to Mexico. LIMEAT. coverage in this case was considered necessary
to reveal immediately any renewal of an earlier planned attempt on
the life of an CYOME official by one group of the Republican Exiles.
Ultimately, LIFEAT revealed the departure from Mexico of two of the
ringleaders in the plot.
LIFEAT/CI/CE: At Headquarters request LIFEAT Foxerage was established
on a former SMOTH agent whose past actions gave for some suspicion of
his present activities. Product from this line has revealed an effort
by a group of this individual's friends to discredit the senior CNACID
official in Mexico. Early warning by LIFEAT has made possible the
preparation of counter action (see HNMA-21364). LIFEAT has also
provided coverage of a suspected RIS support agent. This coverage
had provided the background material necessary for checking on the
activities of this suspect agent. Continuing LIFEAT reporting on the
American Communist Group in Mexico (ACGM) has provided ODENVY with
great quantities of information on activities of leftist friends of
SECRET /
7
of the ACOM including their travel plans to Mexico and in some cases
Cuba. As noted in paragraph I. E. above, the local office of ODENVY
considers this coverage "quite valuable". As also noted in previous
renewals, LIFEAT ability to give the interested case officers a check
on active and former agents increases the security of present opera-
tions and provides greater security for long term assets who may have
been in contact with now terminated agents.
H. Conclusion
It is the opinion of the Mexico City Station that the support provided
other Station operations, the CI/CE information and leads, and the
ability of the unilateral LIFFAT operation to cover sensitive targets
without revealing Station interest to the liaison forces, well justify
the expenditure of funds, time, personnel and security risk. As it has
been noted in the past, that even with the Station's envolvement in the
parallel, but liaison-type LIENVOY operation, a change in attitude by
the present local government administration or a change in government
administrations could end KUPARK participation in that liaison project.
For that reason, LIFEAT, in addition to maintaining its present heavy
coverage, must be available to once again undertake coverage of the
official Soviet and Czech official targets in Mexico City. Therefore,
LIFFAT's present orientation, though toward supporting Station operations
and CI/CE mission rather than toward targets which would provide positive
intelligenco, leaves it readily available for recall into the Soviet-
Czech coverage. It is the Station's firm opinion that the LIFEAT
project provides a substantial and vital contribution in fuifilment the
several priority objectives of the Station's Related Mission Directive.
I. There is attached a list of the H's produced from LIFFAT provided
material during the period July 1962 through May 1963, as a by-product
of the project's prime responsibility of providing support to Station
cperations.
II. Progress of the Operation
The objectives of the LIFEAT Project are of a continuing nature and
are therefore not considered for fulfillment during any given period of
time. For this reason percentage figures as to completion of project
objectives cannot be drawn, However, an indication of the coverage
provided in working toward fulfillment of the objectives can be noted
in that approximately 12,500 pages of raw text were produced in the
period July 1961 through April 1963, LIFEAT has been in daily opera-
tion during the review period with the average number of lines covered
per month being 19, and a high in October 1962 of 25 lines covered.

III. Planning for the Future
As was indicated at the time of the last project renewal, LIFEAT hopes
to remain uncommitted to coverages that require the expenditures of
a great portion of LIFFAT resources but provide coverage of but one
target...such as Soviet Embassy coverage. It is added emphatically,
however, that should the need arise for LIFEAT to again assume such
responsibilities, it is fully able to do so. Until such time LIFEAT
wili continue to enjoy greater flexibility in the employment of its
assets, especially in the areas in which the Station does not wish
to reveal its interest or operations to the liaison forces involved
in the LIE:ΝΟΥ operation.
V. Expenditures
Approval for renewal of Project LIFEAT was granted 8 August 1962 for
FY 1963 in the arcunt of $99,000.00. The proposed budget for FY 1964
is broken down in the attached Field Project Outline Renewal Request,
Part II, and totals123, 303.
VI. Status of Commitments
There are no commitments other than those noted in the project outline
submitted herewith and in the individual contracts and oral agreements
(memoranda of oral agreements were forwarded as necessary) of the
various LIFEAT personnel.

Even with the operational emphasis of the LIFEAT Project being
on Station operational support, it is thought significant to

PROJECT LIFFAT
PROJECT OUTLINE, PART I
1. Area of Operations
This operation is run from Mexico City Station and is concerned with targets
located within Mexico City.
2. Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide, unilaterally, daily information
on the activities of official foreign installations in Mexico and the personnel
thereof, as well as coverage of the activities of selected individuals and
groups in response to both Station needs and Headquarters requests. Presently,
LIFEAT stresses flexibility of coverage with support of Station operations and
CI/CE coverage receiving the greatest emphasis.
3. Background
Project LIFEAT was originated on 3 October 1950 as a unilateral telephone tap
operation. Actual initiation of operations under this authority occurred
on 18 January 1951, and the operation has run continuously from the date.
The project was opened with the installation of a single tap and has grow
in the past eleven years to coverage of as many as thirty lines in a given
month.
The LIFEAT Project is a unilateral operation completely independent from any
liaison arrangement. It is staffed by KUBARK contract employees with the
majority of personnel being indigenous controlled agents.
During the past twelve years, Project LIFEAT has produced more than 97,000
(estimate) pages of operational and intelligence information in direct support
of Mexico City Station's specific objectives, and contributed materially to
the intelligence gathering activities connected with the Soviet-Satellite
Bioo and more recently with the Cuban representatives in Mexico. In addition,
LIFEAT has been of considerable value in monitoring the activities of the
American Communist Group in Mexico (ACGM), as well as the activities of the
exile groups and local Communists.
With the LIENVOY's assumption of coverage of the Soviet and Czechoslovakian
official installations in July 1960, LIFEAT assets were released from continuous
coverage of these two targets. These assets were then employed in direct
support of Station operations--a role ideally suited for a unilateral operation
such as LIFEΑΤ, and extremely important to the security and success of Station
operations.

e. Maintain LIFFAT capabilities for mounting operations against
targets of opportunity.
f. Maintain supervision over basehouses, equipment, and training of
personnel assigned to the LIFEAT operations.
8. Coordination
a. Information produced by LIFEAT, primarily a Station operational
support asset, is closely coordinated with other operations of the Mexico
City Station. No operational coordination is required with any other
geographical area, but they are advised of any information produced by LIFEAT
which may be of interest to them.
b. Project LINOO which supports the principal "outside" Case Officer,
David M. WILSTED, is effected in coordination with Project LIFEAT.
c. Coordination with the parallel, but liaison project. LIENVOY, 18
alosely coordinated between the responsible Case Officers of both projects,
particularly relating to the division of coverage between the two operations,
thereby assuring that the unilateral LIFEAT operation will not be endangered
by the indigenous personnel of the LIENVOY operation.
d. Although there is no direct connection with the recently activated
LIHACK operation of the Merida Base, LIFFAT experience in unilateral telephone
tap procedures and especially security and processing of information, aided
COB Merida in setting up the LIHACK operation.
