MSG NO 12 (TWELVE) RECEIVED MSG NO 11 (ELEVEN). IN MY POSSESSION
CANS NOS. 8 AND 16 (EIGHT AND SIXTEEN). THE ONE MARKED 8 IS IN PERFECT
CONDITION. THE ONE MARKED 16 WAS OPENED BY (VALENTIN)(ANTRUNK-18)
ON BOTH SIDES (ENDS) AND THE BATTERIES WHI I GOT WET WERE SULFATED
(OXIDIZED) ALTHOUGH THE RECEIVER, AFTER HAVING BEEN CLEANED, WORKED
WELL ENOUGH. ON SUNDAY, THE 27TH (SEPTEMBER), I RECEIVED THE MESSAGE
SENT. THE FIRST PART WAS DECIPHERED ALTHOUGH THE REST COULD NOT BE
DUE TO UNSERVICEABLE GROUPS. THE OTHER DOCUMENTS ON HOW TO OPERATE
THE EQUIPMENT WERE SAVED. EVERY FIFTEEN DAYS I GO OVER TO CARDENAS.
VALENTIN HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ANYTHING ELSE OUT (OF THE CACHE).
(HORACIO) SAYS IT IS VERY DANGEROUS AT THIS TIME. (VALENTIN) HAS OPENED
ALL THE PACKAGES BECAUSE (GORACIO (AMTRUNK-15) HAS GIVEN ME THE DETAILS
OF WHAT THEY CONTAIN. DURING MY LAST VISIT I TOLD HORACIO THAT HE
HAD TO (RECOVER) THE PACKAGES AND ASKED HIM TO LET ME KNOW WHEN THEY
WERE IN HIS POSSESSION. FELIX (AMTRUNK-10) CALLED MY SISTER-IN-LAW
(THE MOTHER OF AVICE-14) AND SAID HE WAS COMING TO SEE ME. I HAVEN'T
SEEN HIM FOR OVER TWO MONTHS. I CAN'T MOVE (AROUND) BECAUSE MY CAR
IS BROKEN AND I CANNOT FIND THE SPARE PARTS (TO REPAIR IT). BECAUSE
OF MY ILL HEALTH I AM ON HALF PAY AND CAN'T GET AROUND BECAUSE OF
LACK OF MONEY
