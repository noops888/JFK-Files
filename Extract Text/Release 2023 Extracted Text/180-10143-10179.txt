13 contained in this file.
The file contained two memoranda for the record. prepared
by [Catherine La Maistre, Jdated June 30, 1961 and July 10, 1961.
The June 30. memo contains the following information:
a- Rothman's DOB is 26 Dec 1914; POB is Bronx, NY.
b- "When Rothman first came to CIA's attention in
Sept. 1958, he was living in Dallas, Texas and was
allegedly engaged in public relations work. According to his wife,
Gloria, he made a one-week trip to Los Angelos in September
on undisclosed business."
c- In oct 1959, Rothman was managing the Biltmore
Terrace Hotel in miami trom which he was reported by the FBI
to be supplying an anti-castro organization with arms which
he obtained through us. gangsters...."
d- Following Pittsburgh conviction, Rothman went to
Chicago, where he surrendered on charges of playing a key role
in one of the biggest robberies in modern criminal history, the
$ 13,5 million looting of a Canadian bank..... "Robbery was
touched off when the Canadian branch of the mafia received a
hurry up order from the Caribbean for arms. The Canadian
mafia did not have the money to buy arms, but it knew how
to get hands on the contents of the Brockville Ontario bank.
It called upon the U.S. matia fortassistance, and it was then
that Rothman entered the picture, it was charged. Subsequently
portions of loot turned up in Shanghai, Argentina, Cuba,
and Australia."
e-Before Rothman was tracked down in connection with the above
crimes, he was reported by the FBI as traveling to Yucatan to
seek a base of operations against the Castro gout. In this enter-
prise he was associated with (Teddy) Whitehouse Insua, formerly
of the Cuban Civil Aeronautical Association', ex-Colonal
Orlando Piedra Negueruela & former member of BRAC and
head of Cuban Bureau of Investigations, and Colonel Roberto
Fernandez Miranda brother-in-law of Batista and former
commander of the presidential guards as well as president
of the National Sports Commission. While no mention is made
of Rolando Masferrer in this connection, Rothman has engaged
in many exploits and deals with Masferrer."
f. " In Sept 1960 Rothman still out on $50,000 bond,
made an approach to Frank Fiorini, soldier of fortune,
offering to obtain two migs- one flown by a Czech
and another by a Cuban. Fiorini felt that Rothman's interest
was stimulated by a straight profit motive or by hopes
for favorable treatment regarding the Fed.case against him."
g. " In Oct. 1960, Rothman again appeared in Dallas,
where he approached Robert E. Grinnan, and oil
contracts promotion man. Rothman claimed to have
connections with Nor-Roth Industries of N.Y.C and stated
that clients of his had an interest in purchasing a million
metric tons of dies al fuel oil and 1 million metric tow
of crude oil to be delivered over a five-year period
to Hamberg, Germany. GSECRETduzzled by the offer
reported to the FBI. He went to N.4. in November and met
Rothman and the other principals of the deal, a Mary
Talley and a Dr. Phillip Paneth de Panay. Largely
because of Grinnan's suspicions the deal was never
consumated."
h..." As of December 1960, Rothman was living in
Dallas, Texas.!"

contains additional background information and an updated
location on Rothman. The memo indicates that during

The file also contains a memorandum for the
Deputy Chief of the Western Hemisphere División from Clark
w.simmons] re a meeting with Rothman and David m.
mcConnell. The memo is dated June 30,1961. The meeting
occurred on June 29, 1961, at the Deputy Attorney General's office
and was for the purpose of evaluating "Rothman's claim to
operational assets inside Cuba and elsewhere in the Caribbean
area. An agreement was made that mcConnell would be
notified of Rothman's "operational potential in cuban affairs"
on July 5. (There is no mention in the file of there any
further communication with mcconnell).

to simmons) and described himself as a "leading political
figure in the Democratic Party machine in N. Carolina," and
stated he was acquainted with Robert Kennedy, General Taylor, and

operational bases in the Yucatan at a cost of $50-81,000, to
sabatoge targets in cuba identified by the uis.gov't,
and to provide positive intelligence on the activities of
Chinese Communist Groups in the Western Hemisphere.
when Rothman was presiedny questioned by [Simmons] he
made the following points、
1- Castro had executed three of his close frienas:

and enter the u.s. through 3rd countries.
7- He knows of many Chinese communists going into
Canada from Cuba.
8- Rothman expressed resentment over gun-running

He said that he had supervised 40 ship operations on behalf
of the Frente against Cuba. He said that CIA would truck
the stust to the point of ship pick-up, where he (mr. Ruthman)
would supervise the loading of the ships. He said that he

boat to support the underground in Cuba. He added that
he knew everything the CIA planned in maritime operations
and for the invasion.“
9- Rothman stated he is a close friend of John Abbes
Garcia - Chief of Dominican Republic Security.
At the conclusion of the memorandum (Simmons) comments

agents and material assets. He recommences that there be no
further discussion with Rothman re these claims.

aka" Teddy". whitehouse is described as a compatriot of Rothman's.
An April 5,1960 report states that whitehouse and Elliot
Spinning intended to take a B-26 to Vera Cruz. Sam Rubin
(believed to be identical with Sam "Stretch" Rubin, chief
doorman at the Biltmore Terrace Hotel) was reported to be
the owner of the B-26 (Reg #N32446). A Dec. 31, 1959
report indicates that uis. Customs seized a B-26 at Miami and
another (N28816) at vero Beach, when whitehouse and
Spinning attempted to move them. A 12 Dec 1960 report

to P. O Box 68, Norborne, Missouri -
Ialso mailed a letter on 11-22-63, with information
for my picket sign for 11-22-63 and 11-25-63. I
addressed it to P.O. Box 1195, the return addres
on a letter I nad received from you. To my dumay,
it has not been answered. The political history of
those two days appears to prove that my letter of
10-22-63 was carried out in full and with an
un expected reply, which brought out the true
nature of communism in full. This should solidly
establish our position for the future. Inzue said
