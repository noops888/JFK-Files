OUR UNILATERAL OFFICERS ALSO HANDLE

ACTIVITY CARRIED OUT BY THESE OFFICERS IS NON-COMPATIBLE, AND WOULD
CAUSE DAMAGE TO STATION'S RELATIONS WITH OUR VARIOUS
CURRENTLY, STATION IS ENJOYING A PERIOD WHEREIN --AS A
RESULT OF PRESIDENT CLINTON'S VISIT HERE IN LATE 1997, AND THE
VISIT TO HEADQUARTERS IN NOV 97--

RELATIONS HAVE NEVER BEEN
CLOSER; THESE WOULD BE TARNISHED, NOT IRREPARABLY BY ANY MEANS
UNNECESSARILY, BY OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION OF CIA USE
HISTORICALLY RELATIONS WITH
1
RUT
HAVE BEEN STRAINED, AND IT IS
ONLY DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS THAT A NEW PRESIDENT AND HIS BOLD
FREE-MARKET REFORMS HAVE PUSHED
SQUARELY INTO THE
DEMOCRATIC ORBIT. CURIOUSLY, THE CLOSE POLITICAL RELATIONS AND OUR
STEADILY-IMPROVING RELATIONS WITH
+-EMBASSY DIPLOMATS AND SENIOR
TO
OR FROM
MEANS THAT BOTH PARTIES
OFFICERS WONDER WHY WE NEED
IF WE CAN GET VIRTUALLY ANYTHING WE ASK FOR FROM
OFFICIALS. INDEED, IN THIS RELATIVELY
OPEN, COMFORTABLE ENVIRONMENT, AN INDICATION THAT STATION WAS WORKING
ON INCOMPATIBLE LOCAL TARGETS WOULD BE ESPECIALLY DAMAGING.
5.
AT THE RISK OF BORING THE READER WITH DETAIL, EMBASSY
IS SO OPEN A WORKPLACE THAT THERE IS NO REAL CLEARED ACCESS
THIS
AREA (CAA), BUT RATHER A "HYBRID" CAA, TO USE THE RSO'S PHRASE.
MEANS THAT FSN'S HAVE LONG HAD OFFICES ON THE THIRD FLOOR, WHERE THE
*EXECUTIVE>OFFICES AND REPORTING OFFICES (INCLUDING STATION) ARE
LOCATED. NEEDLESS TO SAY, STATION IS NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE
CONFIGURATION OF OFFICES
IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, WHERE EMBASSY OFFICERS DO NOT HAVE A
FULL APPRECIATION OF THE ROLE/NEED FOR INTELLIGENCE IN SUCH AN OPEN,
FRIENDLY SOCIETY, OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION OF CIA'S USE
WOULD ONLY REAFFIRM THEIR POINT OF VIEW. OUR FEW
WOULD ESSENTIALLY THEN BE DECLARED. STATION WOULD HAVE TO ATTEMPT TO
CHANGE OUR
PROFILE BY OBTAINING MORE
OFFICERS WHILE
REDUCING THE NUMBER
AS HEADQUARTERS IS AWARE,
UNDER CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES THERE ARE FEW
AND THE SELECTION AND
TRAINING OF NEW ONES TAKES YEARS AND IS EXPENSIVE. IN THIS SCENARIO,
WOULD NEVER RECEIVE ENOUGH PRIORITY TO WARRANT SENDING
SLOTS WE CURRENTLY
THREE
TO REPLACE THE THREE
HAVE. THE END RESULT WOULD BE THAT WE WOULD COLLECT VERY LITTLE
INTELLIGENCE ON MAJOR PORTIONS OF OUR OPERATING DIRECTIVE (OD).
SPECIFICALLY, INTERNAL POLITICAL REPORTING, WHICH IS A FIRST PRIORITY
OBJECTIVE, WOULD BE ZEROED OUT, AND REPORTING ON THE WP AND ES
TARGETS, BOTH SECOND PRIORITY OBJECTIVES, WOULD BE NON-EXISTENT.
THIS WOULD BE A SERIOUS LOSS TO THE USG, SINCE OUR WP REPORTING HAS
HISTORICALLY BEEN THE ONLY MEANS OF LEARNING TO WHAT EXTENT THE
1
1
ARE RESPECTING INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND NOT REBUILDING
THEIR MISSILE PROGRAM.
ON THE ES TARGET, WE WOULD LOSE SIGNIFICANT
REPORTING ON REGIONAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND THE IMPACT OF THE ASIAN
FINANCIAL CRISIS IN THE AMERICAS. PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY, HOWEVER,
WE WOULD LOSE THE TRUST OF
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND OF SOME
SENIOR
OFFICIALS, WITH THE PREDICTABLE RESULT THAT IT WOULD
TAKE YEARS TO REBUILD THE RELATIONSHIP.
