Remarks:
Our files on Martin Luther King reveal
that after King's killing that an attempt was made to
locate the killer, initially suspected to be one
GALT but later found to be dames Earl Ray, in various
countries where it was suspected he might have fled
There is no written request from the FBI to do this
but Er Cher had a number of conversations with Mr.
Papich of the Fal which are referred to in our files.
It would be reasonable to xxxxxx conclude that our
effort to locate Ray was done in close coordination
with the FBI and probably at the FBI's specific request
A check of our files after the killing revealed
nothing on Pay prior to the Killing of King.
