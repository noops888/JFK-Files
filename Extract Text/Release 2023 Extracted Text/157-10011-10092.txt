like a broken man, he did that day anyway. But he was a very

MR. OLSEN: To use the house term, he was a spook?
MR. MARCHETTI: Yes. He was a very exotic character.

And all kinds of stories float around about Jim Angleton.
I am sure that some are nothing more than apocryphal and some
8
are pure rumor.

What intrigued me about this Runge thing is that
subsequently another reporter
and this time the guy identi-

fied the man he had been talking to the man he had been
talking to was Bill Harvey, who was one of the people respon-
sible for exposing Philby, in fact Philby gives Harvey the
credit in his book under a pseudonym that Harvey said to
this guy, oh, yes, the Agency to this reporter
Agency has been penetrated, it may even be now he made some
pompous statements of that nature. But then when the guy tried
yes, the
18
19
20
to dig deeper, Harvey held him at arm's length.
MR. OLSEN: Who is Harvey?
MR. MARCHETTI: Bill Harvey was a scenario officer.
21
He had been, among other things, Chief of Base

22
the Cold War He had been Head of the Cuban task force.

now?

MR. OLSEN: Which Cuban task force do you refer to
MR. MARCHETTI: Within the Agency, the Agency's own

Soviet defectors and peoplw who claim to be and have subse-

MR. MARCHETEI: You mean found to be illegitimate

defectors?
5
MR. OLSEN: No, found to be legitimate defectors
6
well, either way.

MR. MARCHETTI: Well, they would turn up from time to

of agents within the US Government.
Usually I didn't have any direct dealings. They were
handled by the Clandestine Services. But you would know the
case. There is the famous case of Olenevski (?), who is this
Polish intelligence officer who said that he was a KGB plantin
the Polish service, and he is the one that many people on the
extreme right like to point to as having identified all kinds
Eventually I got to the
15 point where the was taking out ads in the newspapers to the
16:
17
effect that he is the tsaravitch, he had survived the shooting,
and the legal claim and the throne.
18
At this point you don't know if the guy was nuts all
19
along, and I don't know what the official thinking about it
20
at the Agency is.
21
But there have been anumber of others over the years.
22
There is
23
MR. OLSEN: How do you spell his name.
24
MR. MARCHETTI:
25
These names are a matter of record. You will have

or not it comes within the charter of the CIA?

MR. HARCHETTI: No.. As I say, I have no first hand
knowledge on this subject.
You remember the finev-Rouse case?
MR. OLSEN: Yes. You mentioned that in your book, I
believe, don't you?
MR. MARCHETTI: I was in the Agency at the time that
happened, but I knew practically nothing about it in the Agency.
For one reason, I didn't pay any attention to it. I had no
reason to. But it was after getting out of the Agency.
12

15
This happened to be a case where Rouse, under Agency
orders, was directed to Mineyas being a Soviet agent in the
L.Estonian group, And Minev apparently to this day claims
absolute innocence, and said that he was framed, and it was
done
for
16
other reasons, because he didn't see eye to eye with the
Agency
17
18
MR. OLSEN: You don't know the story behind that, I
take it?
19
MR. MARCHETTI: No. But you could find out. I don't
20
21
22
know what the Agency was doing. All I know is that Helms
submitted some sort of affidavit which the judge accepted, and
on the basis of that the case was resolved in favor of
23
He had to idneitify
24
as being in the Agency's employ and
25
acting under orders from the Agency. The reasons why, they are
TOP SECRET

seem to work properly except in the US. And I am wondering what
1
2
kind of use in the US you might be aware of?
01
MR. MARCHETTI:
That wasn't what I meant by that.
4
What I meant was, it worked good under laboratory conditions
5
here, but when I would take it out to the field, it wouldn't
work.
6
MR. ROETHE:
7
You weren't referring to any use of these
beams here in the US?

MR. MARCHETTI:
But that is that system that people are talking about
now, the laser people bugging system, where they can get a
building across the street there and direct a beam here and
pick it up. It has become quite popular in recent years, at
least they talk about it.
MR OLSEN: YOu mean in the spy literature?
No, I was not.
15
MR MARCHETTI:
Yes.

:
MRROETHE: At page 196 you refer to monitoring of
17
embassy traffic from Maryland and Virginia.
Were you referring

to CIA's activity in monitoring, or NSAP
MR. MARCHETTI: NSA
MR. ROETHE: You are not aware of any CIA activity of
21
this nature?

MR. MARCHETTI: No, not here in this country. In

MR. ROETHE:
3
There is one reference to breaking into:
4
embassies at page 199.
And there is no reference to any
5
6
particular embassy. Are you aware of any activity where the
CIA was actually implicated in breaking into an embassy? You
7
have already talked about the Cilean Embassy.
MR. MARCHETTI:
8
This was based on information that was
9
availabe in the Houston Plan, which by that time had become
10
public. And also certain background information about the
11 capabilities of the SAgin its technical field, and certain CIA
clandestine abilities. And it was all rolled into one as a
12
supposition.

MR. ROETHE: On page 207 you indicate that many
individuals at CIA were pressing for action against the KGB
here in the US as the FRI was not doing a good enough job?
16
MR MARCHETTI:
Yes.
17
MR. ROETHE: Do you know of any actual operations that
18
were ever taken by teh CIA, or do you have any evidence of such
19
operations?
20
MR. MARCHETTI:
21
No, I do not.
MR. ROETHE: On page 216 you refer to training of
22
New and Chicago police.
What kind of training are you referring
23
to, or do you know?
24
MR. MARCHETTI: That is just it. I am not exactly sure
