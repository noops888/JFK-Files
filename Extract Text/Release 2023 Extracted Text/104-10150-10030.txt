APPRAISAL OF CONTENT: ADZHUBEY PROBABLY MADE THE COMMENTS AS REPORTED.
DURING A RECEPTION AT THE SOVIET EMBASSY, ALEKSEY ADZHUBEY
CRITICIZED THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT'S ERROR IN OVEREMPHASIZING INDUSTRY AT THE EXPENSE
OF AGRICULTURE. HE URGED THE SOVIET DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY TO INCREASE ITS
CONTACT WITH THE THAI PEOPLE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE REPORTING ON LOCAL
CONDITIONS. ADZHUBEY FELT THE THAIS SHOULD KNOW THE SOVIETS BETTER TOO.
ADZHUBEY SAID SEATO, CENTO AND NATO ARE USELESS, THAT THERE IS TROUBLE IN
VIETNAM AS WELL AS LAOS, AND THAT THAILAND SHOULD LEAVE THE SEATO
SYSTEM. LATER COMMENTS BY ADZHUBEY TO PRIME MINISTER THANOM AND
MINISTER THANAT ON POOR PRESS COVERAGE OF SOVIET EVENTS ARE MENTIONED
C-3/567,770.
A RECEPTION GIVEN IN HIS HONOR AT THE SOVIET EMBASSY, BANGKOK,
NOVEMBER 1963, ALEKSEY ADZHUBEY, "IZVESTIYA" EDITOR AND KHRUSHCHEV'S
SON-IN-LAW, DELIVERED A SPEECH TO SOVIET BLOC REPRESENTATIVES WHO WERE
ASKED TO STAY AFTER THE RECEPTION. ADZHUBEY EXPRESSED DEEP PERSONAL AND
NATIONAL REGRET AT THE DEATH OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY AND EULOGIZED HIS
WORK. CONCERNING THE SOVIET UNION, ADZHUBEY
SAID THE GOVERNMENT HAD ERRED IN PLACING TOO GREAT AN EMPHASIS
ON INDUSTRY WITH TOO LITTLE THOUGHT OR EFFORT FOR THE AGRICULTURAL
PART OF THE POPULATION. THIS LED TO THE SHORTAGE OF WHEAT AND OTHER
FOOD IN GENERAL. ADZHUBEY EMPHASIZED THAT MEMBERS OF THE SOVIET
COMMUNITY IN THAILAND SHOULD MAKE GREATER EFFORTS TO UNDERSTAND THE
SITUATION, TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THAILAND AND ITS PEOPLE. THIS WOULD LEAD
TO MORE COMPREHENSIVE REPORTING ON LOCAL CONDITIONS. ADZHUBEY
ALSO STATED, THAT SOME CONTACTS MAY NOT AGREE WITH THE
IDEOLOGY. THERE ARE MANY OTHER AREAS ON WHICH
THE SOVIETS SHOULD LEARN MORE ABOUT THAILAND, BUT
IT IS VITAL FOR THE THAIS TO KNOW THE SOVIETS BETTER.
