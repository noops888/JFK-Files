Mystery Witness in JFK Inquiry
A mystery witness has sworn to con-
gressional Investigators that a Central
Intelligence Agency agent Introduced
him to Lee Harvey Oswald in Dallas
three months before Oswald gunned.mo, "would of course be the expecta-
down President John F. Kennedy.
The witness, whom we have agreed
to identify only as Mr. X because of at-
tempts of his life, is the founder of a
Cuban terrorist group that worked
closely with the CIA.
The group hold secret meetings at
3126 Hollandale in Dallas before the as-
sassination. Not long after Kennedy.
was shot, a Dallas deputy sheriff was
told by an informant that Oswald had
been associating with some Cubans at
"3128 Hariendale."
Mr. X's dramatic testimony casts
new light on the story Sylvia Odlo,.
daughter of a wealthy opponent of Cu-
ban Premier Fidel Castro, told to the
FBL Two months before the Kennedy
killing, she related, she was visited in
her Dallas apartment by three men、
who identified themselves as friends
of her father.
t
One was introduced to her as "Leon
Oswald." When she saw the picture in
the newspapers of the man who had
shot Kennedy, she fainted from shock.
It was the same Oswald, she was cer-
tain, who had visited her apartinent..
Congressional investigators have
now learned that the late J. Edgar
Hoover deliberately misled the War-
ren Commission about Odlo's mysteri-
ous visitors. She was such a persuasive
witness that the commission staff was
preparing to investigate her story
thoroughly.
Staff members even speculated, ac-
cording to one internal memo, that the
anti-Castro forces might have re-
crulted Oswald, a known, pro-Castro
activist to kill Kennedy.
"The motive on this," states the me-
tion that after the President was
killed, Oswald would be caught or at
least his identity ascertained; the law
enforcement authorities and the pub-
lic would then blame the assassination
on the Castro government; and the call
for a forceful overthrow would be irre-
sistible."
But Hoover abruptly blocked this
line of inquiry by notifying the War-
ren Commission on Sept. 21, 1964, that
the FBI had located and kientified
Odio's callers. He named them as
Loran Hall, Lawrence Howard and
Willam Seymour, all anti-Castroltes,
Hoover even suggested that Odio could
have confused the names "Loran Hall"
and "Leon Oswald."
Now the congressional Investigators
have uncovered evidence that all three
denied visiting the Odio apartment
and that the FBI had obtained their
denlais before Hoover wrote his letter
to the Warren Commission.
how Kennedy would die. Then the rab-
ble rouser added knowingly that Ken-
nedy "knows he is a marked man."
Milteer later admitted to the FBI
that he had been in Dallas in June,
1963, but denled having any knowl-
edge of the Kennedy assassination.
However, the Informant told the FBI
that he asked Mliteer after the shoot-
ing whether he had known about it in
advance or had merely been guessing.
"I don't do any guessing," replied Mil-
teer.
But the most explosive development
is Mr. X's statement that he met Os-
wald in the company of a CIA agent.
Congressional investigators questioned
the mystery witness closely on three
separate occasions. They finally con-
cluded that "his credibility is strength-
ened by the details he provides consist-
ent with what he told us before. Signif-
Icantly, he remains very strong on the
Oswald sighting."
The encounter occurred in a down-
town Dallas building, where Mr. X had
an appointment with his CIA contact.
The agent was accompanied by a man
whom Mr. X later recognized as Ken-
nedy's killer.
The Investigators have also obtained
the tape of a fascinating conversation,
predicting two weeks in advance that
Kennedy would be shot "from an off-
Ice building with a high-powered ri-nearly freaked out, but he never said
fle." The prediction was made by the
late Joseph Milteor, a right-wing rab-
ble rouser, who alse Dappened to have
close connections with anti-Castro
leaders.
The conversation was taped on Nov.
9, 1963, in Miami by an FBI Informant
named Willie Somersett, who turned
the tape over to the FBI the next day.
Milteer is heard on the tape describing
"When he saw it was Oswald that
killed Kennedy," the investigators re-
ported in a confidential memo, "he
anything."
The investigators tried to pin down
Mr. X on how he could be sure that
man was Oswald. Mr. X replied, ac-
cording to the memo, that he bad
learned "how to retain the character-
ics of a persori; he had trained himself
to do that. And if it wasn't Oswald, it
was someone who was exactly like On-
wald, his exact double.

House Assassinations Commilice
Chairman. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.)
yesterday abruptly ordered the dismis-
sal of chief counsel Richard A. Spra-
gue, but Sprague refused to leave and
remained holed up in his offices on
Capitol Hill.
In a flurry of letters to Speaker
Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr. (D-Mass.)
and other key members of Congress,
Gonzalez angrily accused Sprague of,
"divisive and deceitful conduct" and
said the spullering investigation could
nol possibly succeed unless he were
fired.

The, latest brouhaha in the life of
the beleaguered committee was trig-
gered carlier this weck when González
made an effort to economize by calling
for at least a temporary cutback in
Ils 73-member staff. The new chair-
nian apparently was rebuffed, first at
a meeting with Sprague in Gonzaler
office Tuesday morning and then by
other members of the commillee al
a secret "informal" meeting later in
the day.
A Keystone Kops flavor was added
to the dispute when Gonzalez ordered
Capitol police to make sure Spra-
gue left his offices in the old FBI Iden-
tification Building by. 5 p.m., and then
had those orders countermanded, ap-
parently by Del. Walter E. Fauntroy
(D.D.C.).

House delayed re-establishing the
committee until last week and then
did so only on a temporary basis, giv-
ing the panel until March 31 to settle
down and come back for a permanent

In a letter to other committee
members, Gonzalez accused Sprague
iin effect of a rule-or-ruin approach to
The Investigation and protested that
under the present circumstances;
"there is no way that this committee
can furiction effectively or carry out
lls.responsibilities to the House."
:
"I am confident that we can carry
Fon a successful investigation without
Mr.. Sprague," Gonzalez declared. "I.
am confident that we cannot do so
with him."
"This committee has been led Into à
scries of errors by'lls counsel; its work,
has been without organization: and
direction; its official reports and docus
ments have been of wholly unaccept-
rable, quality," the chairman's Jelter con-
tinued, "These are matters that must
be remedied if this investigation is to
progress.".
Sprague had no comment except to
slate through a spokesman, shortly al-
¿ler 5 p.m., that he was staying on the
Job because "only the committee has
the power" to fire him.

According to several sources, Goni
zalez had proposed at a secret comit
tee meeting Monday that some staff-
ers be dismissed temporarily because
the committee's present funding: Is
only $84,000 a month and its payroll
amounts to $123,000 a month. A deci-
sion was postponed to Tuesday so that
Sprague could be heard.. He opposed,
the move, pointing out that many slaff-
ers had already taken a voluntary 35
per cent pay cut.:

Gonzalez Submits
Resignation From
JFK-King Panel
By George Lardner Jr.
Washington Post Staff Writer
In an indignant letter to the
Speaker of the House, Rep. Henry
B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) submitted his
resignation as chairman of the
House Assassinations Commillee
yesterday after an admittedly futile
effort to take charge of the inquiry.
lic accused House leaders of failing
to back him up in his struggle with the
committee's chief counsel, Richard A.
Sprague, and said that he saw no.
alternative to quitting "under the cir-
cunistances that now exist."
Accusing Sprague once again of mis-
management, insubordination and dis-
Joyalty, Gonzalez denounced him as
"an unscrupulous individual, an un-
conscionable scoundrel." Sprague, who
has thus far had the backing of the
rest of the 12-member committee, had
no comment.
Apparently caught by surprise,
House Majority Leader Jim Wright
(D-Tex.) said he doubled the investiga-
lion would survive at all unless Gon-
zalez can be persuaded to change his
mind.
The volatile Gonzalez phrased his
resignation letter in terms that ostens-
ibly made his departure immediate
and final but, under a precedent es-
tablished just two years ago, it is up
to the House to accept or reject it.
Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill
Jr. (D-Mass.) said he would not
schedule the issue for floor action
until he first had a chance to speak
to Gonzalez and try to dissuade him.
Gonzalez has been bedridden with flu
in his San Antonio home for the past
12 days.
O'Neill refused to speculate on what

"In view of the low repule we have
in the minds of other members of the
House because of the unseemliness of
the whole squabble, that might be
hard to get," said Rep. John B. An-
derson (IR-111l.), one of the commillec's
four GOP members. "The life of the
committee still hangs by a slim
thread."
The Speaker had already suggested,
in a television appearance last week,
that the committee would go out of
business at the end of the month.
"unless they come up with some-
thing sensational," and he reiterated
that judgment yesterday. He said
some committee members had "told
me they have some breakthrough on
the King business," but O'Neill said
he was not aware of what that might
be.
Del. Walter, E. Fauntroy (D-D.C.),
who has been heading a subcommittee
that would look into the King assas-
sination, hinted of a possible public
hearing to "focus on the results of
the investigation so far." But he de-
clined to predict any bombshells, and
other members said there was none
to be produced.

INQUIRY, From Al
The committee feels there's a good
chance to crack the King case, but
that's a long run," said Rep. Richard-
sop Preyer (D-N.C.), the ranking
Démocrat under Gonzalez. "But I
don't know of any bombshells we're
about to drop."
The commillce was already pre-
pared to postpone the Investigation
into President Kennedy's assassina-
tion, in anticipation of a much, slim-
mer budget than the $6.5 million a
ycar Sprague had proposed.....
Appointed chalrman just last
month, Gonzalez said he was quilling,
as both chairınan and as a member of
the commillee. He described the In-
quiry as mired down in "an adminis-
tralive nightmare," and said he de-
cided to fire Sprague only after find-
ing "unjustifiable salaries, unjustified
employees, and reckless, inexplicable
financial obligations.
It seemed plain that Gonzalez
would Insist on Sprague's ouster if he
were to be expected to change hise
mind. Alluding to an effort by a com-
miltec majority to secure paychecks
for Sprague and the rest of the com-
millec's 73-member staff in Gonzalez'
absence, the chairman protested that
sonic of his colleagues "appear to be
interested in usurping even my minis-
terial powers."
"It seems clear now that the Ilouse
leadership is unwilling to offer me
support," Gonzalez wrote O'Neill!
"Yet, I cannot bring myself to sign
pay vouchers for an unscrupulous in-
dividual, an unconscionable scoundrel,
and no power on earth can compel me
to do so."
Gonzalez aides said hè felt. House
leaders had expected him to bend too
much in keeping Sprague'on the com-
mittee staff. Majorily Leader Wright
acknowledged to reporters later in the
day that he may have miscalculated
on that score, thinking that Gonzalez
could be persuaded. to accept the pros-
ecutor "in a reduced role."
:..
Asked last month by Speaker O'Neill
to mediale the dispute, Wright told re-
porters he had gollen the approval of
eight of the committee's 12 members
to a compromise he had proposed this
weck.
Wright refused to discuss the de-
lails, but it was learned later that it
was a seven-point suggestion involving
Sprague's' retention as chief Investi-
gator and the hiring of "a new person
acceptable to all the members" to re-
place Sprague as staff administrator.
All "final decisions on hiring and fir-
ing would repose with the commillce
membership..."
O'Neill said House leaders would
meet today with other members of the
commillee to discuss the dispute.

PALM BEACH, Fla. - A Russian-

the congressional investigation of the
Kennedy assassination, was found
dead yesterday in an apparent sui-

Palm Beach County Sheriff Rich-
ard Wille identified the victim as
George de. Mohrenschildt, 65, a

Wille said de Mohrenschildt, a
guest at the historic oceanfront man-
sion in suburban Manalapan, Fla., of
Mrs. Charles Tilton III, apparently:
placed the muzzle of a 20 gauge shot-
gun to his mouth and pulled the trig-

The sheriff said de Mohrenschildt
had vanished from Dallas shortly
after a Dutch newspaper report
about three weeks ago claimed he
had prior knowledge of the assassina-
Lion.
De Mohnrenschildt was traced by
a House Assassinations. Committee
investigator to the Florida address,
the sheriff said, and he returned to
the Tilton home about 2:45 p.m. yes-
terday to learn that the investigator,
believed to be Gaeton J.. Fonzi, had
been trying to reach him.

Questions Remain in King Probe
Nine years ago, the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr., spiritual leader of the
civil rights, movement, was gunned
down in Memphis. An escaped convict,
James Earl Ray, was nailed for the
murder.
Yet nagging suspicions persisted
that he may have been hired by oth-.
ers. The public doubt finally forced a
Justice Department task force to
review the case. It has now concluded
that Ray "was the assassin and that he
acted alone."
House investigators, however, have
challenged the Justice Department's
findings in a confidential, 16-page
analysis, they have
signifi-
cant inconsistencies and omissions in
the task force report.
They note that the task force had a
"multitude of leads" to pursue yet In-
terviewed only 30 people. "Thirty in-
terviews could hardly scratch the sur-
face," declares the analysis. "A detec-
tive Investigating a common street
crime may very likely conduct more

tend that they have solved the case.
But they have set forth their clues in a
fascinating secret report, stamped
"Sensitive." Here are the highlights in
chronological order:
• While Ray was serving time in the
Missouri state penitentiary, he told cel-
Imates that he would kill King "If the
price was right." Ray also was quoted.
as saying he intended to seek out a
"businessmen's association" which al-
legedly had offered $100,000 for King's
murder.
• On April 23, 1967, Ray escaped
from the prison by hiding in a large
bread box, which was loaded on a bak-
CASEY
ery truck. The congressional Investiga-
tors are trying to find out "whether
anyone alded Ray in his escape and
whether this assistance was con-
nected" to the King assassination.
• The escapee had immediate access
to false Identities. He posed alternately
as Eric Galt, Ramon George Sneyd,
Paul Bridgman and John Willard.
"These allases correspond to the
names of real men, all of whom lived
close to one another in suburban To-
ronto," report the Investigators. "In ad-
dition, three out of the four bear phys-
resemblances to Ray." Galt "even
had scars in the same location as did
Ray, the forehead and right palm."
The House sleuths want to know
"whether Ray received any help in ob-
taining these allases."
• For the next year, Ray "traveled
across the United States, lived in more
than a dozen citles and traveled in
four foreign countries...A conserva-
tive estimate of his total expenses
would be at least $7,000. Nay himself
estimates that he spent at least $9,500."
Those who did business with him re-
call that "he often paid for items with
new $20 bills." The House Assassina-
tions Committee "Intends to investi-
gate the sources of Ray's funds In gen-
eral and of those $20 bills in particu-
lar."
• The committee has received unver-
Ified reports that Ray was in touch
with the Beverly Hills office of Litton
Industries in California. While he was
posing as Eric Galt, he also listed as his
previous employer a Pascagoula, Miss.,
shipbuilding company owned by Lit-
ton Industries. The investigators are
checking "whether there is any rela-
tionship between Ray and Litton In-
dustries."
• The late William Sartor, a Journal-
Ist, alleged that organized crime fig-
ures had accepted a $300,000 contract
on King's life from a right-wing racist
group. According to Sartor, Ray got in
touch with these men in New Orleans.
The committee is seeking "all eviden-
tlary material that might support or
refute Mr. Sartor's report.
• A witness has told investigators
that he overheard a telephone conver-
sation on the afternoon of the King as-
sassination. "Frank Liberto, a person
with alleged organized crime connect-
this afternoon. Shoot him, even if you
have to do it on the balcony, just do
it."
The committee has received "inde-
pendent corroboration" of a possible
Liberto link. A witness told of a Bir-
mingham, Ala., gunshop owner who,
before the assassination, pointed to a
rifle and said: "This is the gun that is
going to kill Martin Luther King."
Later the witness saw the gunshop
owner "in the company of Ray and
Liberto." The secret, report describes
Liberto as "a target of the committee's
Investigation."
• Ray fled to Toronto after the assas-
sination. He applied for Canadlan
birth certificates under the names of
