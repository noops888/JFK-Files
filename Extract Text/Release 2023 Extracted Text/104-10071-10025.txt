MEMORANDUM
SUBJECT: Jamaican Special Branch Report
-
Jamaica/United States Black Power Ties
1. Pertinent items from the Jamaican Special Branch
monthly report for April 1968, which contains several
references to ties between Black Power groups in Jamaica
and the United States, are provided, in full, below. A
summary of the report, omitting portions concerning the
United States or United States citizens, has been dissemin-
ated in CS-311/06459-68, a copy of which is attached.
2. The items of possible interest, omitted from the
dissemination, are noted below:
During April 1968, four meetings of the Wilson
On
✓faction of the Nation of Islam (NOI) were held.
3 April, Percy Hayles, the boxer, said that he was
impressed with the doctrine and had written to Elijah
Mohammed asking for a scholarship to enable him to
study in one of the Islam Universities in the United
States. Errol Levy said that only a revolution could
end the white man's practice of robbing the black
people of everything.
b. At the meeting on 24 April, Cecil (Prince
Buster) Campbell stated that the premises on 47 Charles
Street in Kingston belonged to him and he was willing
for it to be used for the assistance of the black race.
He called for unity among black people and said that
his organization was fighting to rule Jamaica. He
told members that they should be prepared to meet the
Reverend Sherriffe (aka Thomas View) who would soon be
visiting the Island.
C.
On the 5th and 8th of April, discussions were
vheld led by George Vassel, leader of the Young Socialist
14-00000
-2-
✓ League and a member of the Jamaican (Caribbean)
Workers Movement, on the possibility of holding
demonstrations at the American Embassy in Kingston
to protest against the assassination of Dr. Martin
Luther King. Vassel claimed that there was a United
States citizen hiding in Jamaica to escape the draft
who had in his possession recordings of speeches made
by the late Malcolm X during 1964. One of these vas
entitled "The Ballot or Bullets". He stated that King's
death disproved his theory of non-violence and was
bringing into prominence men like Stokely Carmichael
and H. Rap Brown.
d. During April, about 40 persons including
Winston Monroe, Joseph Christie, Roy Jeffrey, Leonard
✓Solomon and one Ny Survad, who is the American draft
escapee referred to in Paragraph c. above, met at
29 Fourth Street, Trench Town (Dallas Corner), where
Survad, identified as a Black Muslim and a member of
the Black Power Movement (BPM), answered questions put
to him by the gathering. It was understood that Survad
was in Jamaica to solicit support for the BPM in the
United States as well as to establish a branch here.
The record "The Ballot or Bullets" was played by
Survad and recorded by Monroe.
e.
Survad accepted George Myers' invitation to
attend a get-together which he was arranging in Savanna-
la-Mar on 11 May, and to spend a week or two with him
there. They discussed the Congress of Racial Equality
(CORE) and the BPM, and it was suggested that a local
Steering Committee should be appointed to consider the
formation of a group in Jamaica.
f.
(Jamaica Service Comment: Survad has subse-
quently been identified as John Davis, aka Selvyn Grey,
a member of CORE and the Black Muslims. He is in touch
with Rastafarians at Kintyre, and the leaders of the
Viking and Spade Gangs. He is expecting to meet one
Corporal James, aka "Jimmy" of the Jamaica Defence
Force, who is said to have complained that he was
deprived of promotion because of his views. Arrange-
✓ments were also being made for him to meet Walter Rodney
of the University of the West Indies. Survad has stated
14-00000
-3-
that if given the chance he would, within eighteen
months, stage a demonstration. He has suggested that
if his colleagues can supply marijuana and find a way
to export it, he could guarantee an outlet in the
United States and the money thus obtained could be
used to finance the local Movement. Survad was being
supported by his girlfriend, Bernadine Houston, who
was expected to arrive from the United States towards
the end of the ensuing month. He is now in straitened
circumstances.)
