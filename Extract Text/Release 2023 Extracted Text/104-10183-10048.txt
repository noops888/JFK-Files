2023 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
13 November 1962
MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:
SUBJECT: Meeting with AMWHIF-1 (Telephone N.Y.C. JU 6-4622)
DATE AND PLACE: 1800-1930 hours, 5 November 1962, Hotel Taft
New York City
PRESENT: Subject and John Sherwood) (alias Breitheim)
BACKGROUND:
1. The instant meeting was set on to determine whether
Subject would be a likely candidate to fill a temporary slot
in B. AZ, Rio) or (SAGOD as a PA working more or less exclusively
to attempt to penetrate the local Cuban diplomatic installation.
Since Wainwright was to be out of town for an indefinite period,
I was detailed to make the above determination. The meeting
was set by phone on the above date.
OPERATIONAL:
2. The main point of the meeting was settled quickly.
Subject indicated that he would be willing to take a three or
four month trip to Latin America for us, and to perform what-
ever operational tasks we felt he would assign to him. The
only qualification: This trip could not be taken until after
the first of the year. Subject stated that though the jewelry
business is presently in its pre holiday doldrums, this situa-
tion would change in about ton days to one of intense activity.
He simply could not afford to take extensive time out at this
Juncture. I am sure Subject was giving a straight line, and
thus made no attempt to pressure him, particularly since we
had no pressing specifics to put him to work against.
I asked
whether he knew of any Cubans in the Capitols of L.A. who
might be useful for our work. He came up with the name of the
former manager of the labana Hilton, Jose MENENDEZ DPOB 1920708
Cuba, presently manager of the Carrera Hilton, SAGO.Subject
chatmed this man was smart, dedicated to anti-Communism,
averred as to how he thought (MENENDEZJwould be happy to coop-
erate, and would certainly know much about the doings of most
Cubane 10 SAGO 16 KOTE: Upon return to Headquarters I learned
from Mareliun that SAGO in already in touch with MENENDEZ) but
not for Cuban ops,

3. Subject said that he is to make a four day trip to
Columbia within the coming fortnight and would be happy to
tackle any reasonable task we might ask of him. He agreed
that it would be a simple matter for him to introduce AIS to
MENENDEZ. I advised that we might want him to aid us in some
such fashion, but that I could think of mothing at the moment.
I asked him to give a ring as soon as his travel plans were firm.
4. One other bit of ops business: I asked Subject to go
over the Robert ECHEVERRI business again and when he was
through with the story, requested that he he phone the Cuban
Embassy in Ottawa to find out if (ECHEVARRIA) were still there.
We worked out a couple of routines to cover all eventualities
we could think of, that is, what to say if the man were out
of the office, and so forth. Af ECHEVARRIA were to be there,
Subject was to arrange a meeting in Montreal for a day some 10
days hence. NOTE: Subject phone on 6 November to report_that
he had caller per arrangement and was told that ECHEVARRIA) had
left Ottawa for Havana in June and would probably not be
returning.
COMMUNICATIONS:
5. Subject will continue to write to WAINWRIGHT alias
THOMPSON and to phone me alias BREITHEIM on 737-8294.
