I went into DC today to meet with Jack and look at the space on Indiana Ave. Two GSA reps, 3 FBI people, Jack and I walked through
the area. Looks like the modifications will be fairly easy and I am going to work up some options for Jack and his board to review. The
FBI says a few of their documents are TS. Do you have any idea if there are TS/SCI documents involved from our side (or any other
agency's side)?

by the Board will be approved once all of the Board's staff
receives SCI clearances. Requests for SCI clearances should
be sent by the Board to HRG for forwarding to Director,

ARRB Proposals to Expedite Review of Assassination Records
I. Re-location of Sequestered Collection to ARRB site will
allow ARRB staff on-site access to identify relevant/key
files and documents, and review Agency designated non-
related material.
Comment:
It is not feasible to transfer the entire collection
and continue CIA's review. Parts of the collection can be
transferred on temporary basis without impeding HRG's review
provided security and DO concerns are satisfied.
Security Requirements/Issues:
A
1) Agency Controlled Secure Area
pays?
construction cost/who
[ARRB should pick up this cost.]
2) Document Access Control:
a) During work-day
detailed CIA reviewers or
designated ARRB staffer?
b) after hours CIA guard or existing guard force?
DO Concerns:
Provided security requirements are met, DO has no
objections to portions of the JFK sequestered collection
being temporarily housed at ARRB site as needed for review.
[Note: Fred W. is checking with DO security re requirements
for storing records off-site.]
HRG Requirements:
1) Office/ workspace for HRG project officer and two or
three reviewers.
[Depending on security requirements, 2 HRG reviewers could
either be assigned to ARRB on a regular basis or report
there as needed project officer will be visiting ARRB
site on regular basis.]
2) Secure phone and FAX (STU IIIs) is a necessity; video
Conference capability would enhance communications.
3) Computer support PC/Word Processing is a necessity;
direct link to HRG index would enhance capability to handle
ARRB Staff questions and expedite review.
4) Priority Courier Service from IP at ARRB
:
13-00000
II. Expedite the review of the Sequestered Collection by
focusing on most relevant files/documents and not sending
duplicates to the Board for action.
Comment:
HRG has already implemented a review focusing on
documents that have not been acted on by the Board;
duplicates are flagged and will be prepared for NARA later.
Due to the duplicate search, the amount of time for an HRG
reviewer to review a box has increased, but the number of
documents per box for action has decreased.
A targeted /subject approach (identify and review most
relevant material first) will be difficult to implement
given current state of HRG index.
Additional review and computer support will be need to
meet the Board's request.
Requirements:
1) Increase HRG re-review team to 4 or 5 reviewers.
2) Begin separate review of HSCA material including
documents held by the ARRB 2 reviewers.
[Note: HSCA material is a high priority of the Board;
however, since most HSCA documents are releasable in full,
the review generate few documents for Board action.]
3) Enhancements to the HRG index/data base will be required
to facilitate searching and identifying duplicates (work
already under way)
4) Communications and computer support same as Request I
III.

Resource Requirements/impact
Note: Detailing two or three CIA reviewers to ARRB will
offset much of the negative impact of the move to IP.
addition to controlling access to CIA records, these
reviewers would:
In
1) perform quality control review of documents prepared
for the Board at IP (processing mistakes have been a
continuing problem in the review]
2) handle questions from the ARRB staff consulting with
project officer and IP HRG/DO reviewers as necessary
3) Review HSCA material being held by ARRB and 3rd
Agency documents (a DO reviewer would join the HRG
reviewers when documents were ready for DO review]

FROM:
SUBJECT:
Director, Center for the Study

John F. Pereira
Chief, Historical Review Group, CSI
JFK Board Request for Transfer
of CIA Documents
(U) This memorandum is for your information. It
summarizes arrangements between CIA and the JFK
Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) to transfer
certain CIA records to the Board's offices.
(FOUO) Background: During a meeting with you on 16
October, ARRB Chairman John Tunheim requested that the
Agency transfer a large quantity of records related to the
JFK assassination. The request was based on the Board's
need to have the documents--totaling approximately 190,000
pages--reviewed by the Board's staff. Judge Tunheim and
other Board members consider it unworkable for their staff
to review the documents in the International Point Building,
to which the records would be moved when the Center for the
Study of Intelligence moves there in mid-November.
(C) The principal issue raised by the request is one of
control over and protection of the sensitive CIA (mainly DO)
records once they are transferred to the Board's offices in
the District at 600 E Street, N.W. The Board has agreed to
construct a dedicated secure facility (SCIF), access to
which would be controlled by Agency personnel. Roger
Martin, DCI Area Security Officer, has conducted a
preliminary survey of the space where the SCIF would be
located, and concludes that the proposed security
arrangements would be acceptable.
for open shelf storag
(FOUO) A second issue concerns funding for the
construction of the SCIF. There would also be additional
costs for installation of a secure telephone and a secure
fax, which are needed to allow secure communications with
International Point. We are proposing that the Agency and
ARRB share the costs, but it is possible that the Agency
will be asked to reimburse the Board for whatever funds they
expend. In any event, we do not believe that the costs will
be great.
:
(FOUO) Conclusion: Our judgement is that the Agency
should comply with the JFK Board's request to transfer the
records, but that the transfer should clearly be documented
as temporary. The documents would be provided in
increments. Once the Board's staff has reviewed a group of
records, they would be returned to the Agency for final
review and sanitization, before they are released to the
National Archives. We plan to detail to the Board a small
number of reviewers from the Historical Review Group who
would control access to the documents and also assist in
coordinating the records review.
(FOUO) Unless you have objections, we plan to transfer
to the JFK Board the records requested by the Board's
Chairman. The transfer will be contingent on the
installation of an approved security facility and an
agreement on funding.

view specific documents related to the JFK assassination. Russ Holmes is being interview on
December 13 by the ARRB staff concerning his role as custodian of the Agency's JFK assassination

Holmes that were found in working files that he had set up.
2. The ARRB's Executive Director and General Counsel are aware that Mr. Holmes'
separation from the Agency was controversial. His access will be restricted to those documents
that his knowledge is required to clarify the historical record. The ARRB staff will provide a list to
the Agency of all classified documents seen by Mr. Holmes.
3. This request for clearance has been coordinaated with Fred Wickham and Ken Johnson
of DO/IMS. IMS is Mr. Holmes' fromer office and the current DO focal point for ARRB requests.
