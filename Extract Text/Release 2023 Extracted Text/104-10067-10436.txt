LATIN AMERICAN INTELLECTUALS AND BY REPORTING ON ACTIVITIES/ATTITUDES
OF MEXICAN LEFT-WING INTELLECTUALS. FOR PERSONAL REASONS, TICHBORN
LEFT MEXICO IN AUG 1966. DURING PERIOD 1 OCT 1966

DIVISION HAD OPPORTUNITY TO USE TICHBORN AS POLITICAL ACTION ADVISOR
ON ONE OCCASION. FILE INDICATED HE ALSO MADE MAJOR EFFORT TO DEVELOP
IN-DEPTH STUDY OF THE PRI IN MEXICO BUT, AS OF MAY 1967, THIS EFFORT
WAS DROPPED BECAUSE OF RELUCTANCE ON PART OF HIS PRI CONTACTS TO
DISCUSS SENSITIVE PRI AREAS AND TO INTRODUCE HIM TO OTHER CONTACTS.

SEVERED HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS COVER COMPANY ON 31 AUG 1968
