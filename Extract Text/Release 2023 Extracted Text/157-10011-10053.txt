Mr. Schwarz. Reflecting a minute of the meeting on May
2
3rd, Present: General Taylor, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Johnson; Mr.
3
Gilpatric, General Decker, General Lansdale and General
4
Craig; Mr. McCone, and Mr. Harvey.
5
Here I would like to read into the record the entirety
6
of paragraph 2, which is: "Mr. Harvey gave a rundown on
7
progress to date, with agent teams and in the general field of
(1) (B) 8
intelligence, including the Opa-locka interrogation center and
9
the Madrid clandestine interrogation center. He outlined
10
various difficulties encountered and said the three agent teams
11
had been infiltrated and the five W/T sets are in place.
12
Approximately 72 actual or potential reporting sources are
13
also in place. A significant development is that Major Duque
14
has refused to allow agents responsive to him to be dispatched
15
on purely intelligence-gathering missions. (This sort of
16
attitude had been forecast earlier as a possibility, but it now
17
assumes particular importance in view of Duque's stature.)".
18
All right.
19
Now, having marked these three exhibits, Mr. Harvey, they
20
surround your visit to Miami when you passed the poisoned pills
21
to Roselli for assassination purposes.
22
Now you have testified that when you were in Miami you
23
did a lot of other things. Could you first state what they
24
are?

Mr. Harvey. Well, basically, this was one of a number of

operations, and that I had been previously been Chief of
2
Station in Berlin for a number of years. The only time the
3
007 comment was ever made to my knowledge was at a Special
4
Group (Augmented) meeting, and the sort of facetious comment
5
by the then-Attorney General, why can't you and this was a
6
part of his sort of favorite author was Ian Fleming, and so
7
on why can't you gentlemen get things cooking the way 007
8
does?
9
That's the only time I ever recall that being made, or that
10
type of reference being made.
11
As far as this business of the firearms is concerned, the
12
only incident that ever happened on that is the one that I
13
mentioned a moment ago, gentlemen. There was one occasion when
14
as I recall I was at lunch and was called from the Director's
15
Office and told to go to the White House because of a meeting.
16
I did happen to be armed at the time, and it occurred to
17
me as I went in downstairs at the White House that it was most
18
inappropriate for anybody except the Secret Service officer to
19
go up to the White House offices armed, so I checked the sidearm
20
that I had with the Secret Service officer at the desk, and I
21
picked it up on the way out.
22
That is the only incident, as far as I know, not only as
23
far as I know, it is the only incident that ever happened which
24
even remotely resembles the question you raised.

documents we discussed previously.
After you called Frank Hand about the 13 August memo from
2
Lansdale, did you talk to anyone else about the part that
3
you desired excised from that memo?
4
Mr. Harvey. Yes, I probably mentioned the particular memo
5
and the excised parts to several people, Mr. Smothers, and
6
starting with the Director, I am not sure I mentioned that to
7
him personally or not.
8
Mr. Smothers. The Director, you mean Mr. McCone?
9
Mr. Harvey. Yes. If I did not, then I am rather sure
10
that I briefed Walter Elder to brief the Director on this.
11
I may also have discussed it with the Director personally.
12
The memorandum that you have in the record was written
13
to Helms. I believe that was in part confirmatory of an
14
oral conversation I had with him. I probably would have
15
mentioned it, or possibly may have mentioned it to two other
16
individuals who very possibly could have seen the memorandum
17
before I did. One would have been Sam Halpern and the other
18
would have been Bruce Cheeter, who is my Deputy.
19
But now on this last answer, Mr. Smothers, I'm just
20
telling you it would have been logical had I done so. I do
21
not have any firm recollection.
22
Mr. Smothers. Do you recall if you discussed it with
23
any of the other addressees?
24
Mr. Harvey. No, I do not believe that I did, although

SUBJECT:
CUBA
26 April 1962

R459
1. General Lansdale reported on the activities as per the
attached report. McCone expressed dissatisfaction with progress;
stated nothing had been accomplished in putting Cubans in the Army
for training and that no actions had been taken on matters decided
two weeks ago. (In other words, I was very disagreeable.) McCone
finally recommended more action; acceptance of attribution if
necessary; establishment of training facilities; training of guerrillas
and a more dynamic effort in the infiltration of both agents and
guerrillas.
ACTION: A meeting should be arranged between McCone,
Lansdale, and Harvey, immediately upon Harvey's return.
2. The Attorney General requested copies of the Daily Reports on
the Opa Lake interrogation, General Taylor instructed Lansdale to
prepare a summary of the reports, paying particular attention to
specific items of information on complaints which were recurring in
successive interviews.
3. General Taylor requested that Mr. Harvey attend the next
meeting and report on agent activites,
4. General Taylor suggested that McCone review the memorandum
summarizing "Communist Indoctrination of Latin America" with the
President at the earliest opportunity.
5. NPIC made a most interesting presentation of the last
CORONA flight.
ACTION: McCone agreed to arrange briefing for the President
at the earliest convenient time; also briefing for Macmillan when he
is here, at a convenient time.
