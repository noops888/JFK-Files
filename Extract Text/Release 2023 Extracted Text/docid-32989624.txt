MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Director/Comptroller
Agency Support to the U.S. Secret Service
(USSS) for National Democratic (10-14 July
1972) and National Republican (21-24 August
1972) Conventions
This memorandum is for the information of the Executive
Director/Comptroller.
Authorization for CIA support to the U.S. Secret Service
for the Democratic and Republican National Conventions is con-
tained in a memorandum of 7 April 1972 from Chief, CI Staff to
the DCI which was concurred in by the ADDP and approved by the
DCI on 10 April 1972 (copy attached).
On 13 April 1972 the COS, Miami met with the Miami
USSS representative and Mr. Mastrovito of CSS Headquarters to
discuss preliminary planning for Station Miami support to the
USSS prior to and during subject conventions. In 17 April 1972
the C/M/COS and C/CI/LSH met with Mr. Mastrovito at Headquarters
to implement the preliminary planning agreed upon in Miami and
to determine the extent of Headquarters support required by the
USSS.
The basic agreement mutually concurred in by the USSS
and Headquarters representatives provided that:
a. Station WH/Miami would conduct name traces on
all Cubans of interest to the USSS.
b. CIA Headquarters would conduct name traces on
all other foreign born persons of interest to the USSS.
c. CIA would keep the USSS informed of any events
in the Caribbean and Latin American areas that would
have any bearing on the USSS protective mission during
the convention periods. This would include briefings
on Cuba and Cuban policies toward the United States and
on activities of Cuban intelligence operations which
could affect the security of the conventions.
Coverage of Latin American exile groups in the
United States would be the responsibility of the FBI
since CIA had ceased the extensive coverage formerly
targeted against these groups since it was now considered
an internal security function.
On 27 April 1972 a meeting was held at a buffer office
of Station Miami with the USSS Chief of Communica-
tions, Station personnel and a Headquarters representative. It
was agreed that name traces would be handled by Miami security
Field office courier from the SSS to buffer office until the SSS
established communications links from their command post in
convention center, at which time trace requests would be sent
from the command post to USSS headquarters and relayed to CIA
Headquarters. Cuban name traces are relayed to Station WH/Miami
by the Signal Center and non-Cuban traces are conducted by EH/COS.
Replies to USSS requests on non-Cubans are coordinated with
CI/SSO.
Station WH/Miami has arranged the rental of a safehouse
about five minutes from convention center which will provide a
secure and nearby meeting site for USSS and Agency personnel.
This safehouse will be available just prior to and during both
conventions. A Headquarters officer will travel to Miami prior to
the conventions and remain until the conventions adjourn to
assist the Station in providing the support described in paragraph
four above.
Station WH/Miami is in daily contact with the USSS in
Miami, utilizing buffer office as a meeting site when necessary. The
location of Station WH/Miami has not been revealed to the USSS.
Additionally, the Miami Security Field Office maintains normal
liaison with the local USSS Miami unit.
The Station understands that no personnel will be present
at the convention hall, that they will not provide any equipment
unique to the Agency, nor will it provide the use of any other
facilities other than the safehouse described in paragraph six.

Request for Information on Sensitive Activities
You will recall that in Fiscal Years 1971 and 1972,
I believe, Agency funds were made available to the FBI.
These funds may still be possibly held in a special
account for that use. This is one of the areas where
TSD has been very much involved. Chuck Briggs would
have the details as this was handled through the Executive
Director's office and of course Angleton would have
additional information.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations
Areas of Possible Embarrassment
to the Agency
Sometime in the spring or early summer of 1971, Mr. John
Dean levied the requirement on the Agency for information relating to
the Investors Overseas Service (IOS). The original request was
non-specific but it gradually emerged that Dean was concerned with
the possible adverse publicity that might develop regarding the
President's nephew, who was employed by IOS.
There were multiple channels from the White House to the
Agency on this subject:
a. Presumbly Haldeman and/or Ehrlichman to Director
Helms.
b. Someone (unnamed) in the White House to the DDCI,
General Cushman (see attached telephone conversation).
Note that Ehrlichman is mentioned, and
c. John Dean to the CI Staff. These various channels
were sorted out in time and six reports were passed by
the CI Staff to Mr. Fred Fielding for Mr. John Dean.
The telephone call of General Cushman's is of interest since
it gives the flavor of White House concern. It took several days to
uncover the fact that the White House interest centered on the involve-
ment of the President's nephew with IOS and possible adverse publicity.
The reports submitted to Dean's office were routine in nature and were
coordinated with the DCI. After a few months, interest in this sub-
ject died down and we did not pursue it further.
Please return the attachments when they have served your
purpose.
I also include a short note on the Intelligence Evaluation
Committee and Staff prepared by Richard Ober. The original
meetings were held in the office of John Dean at the White House
and the principal sparkplug for this group activity was the then
Assistant Attorney General for Internal Security, Robert Mardian
and then later his assistant, William Olsen. It is noted that Mr.
Mardian is now appearing before the Grand Jury and it is always
possible that he might draw in the Agency.
Before appointing Ober to the IES Staff as the Agency
representative, I had attended various inter-agency meetings pre-
sided over by Mardian. I expressed the view to Director Helms
that Mardian would require very careful handling due to his inex-
perience. Furthermore, Mardian was deeply involved in the split
between Bill Sullivan and Mr. Hoover. On a confidential basis
one or two senior FBI officials stated that Sullivan was secretly
passing files to Mardian without Mr. Hoover's permission. This
was one of the important reasons why Sullivan was dismissed from
the Bureau.
Counter Intelligence Staff,
Police Group Activities
Counter Intelligence Staff, Police Group (CI/PG)
is responsible for Staff coordination within the Office
of the Deputy Director for Operations for activities and
programs involving assistance to foreign police/security
forces for the purpose of exploiting such activities and
programs for intelligence purposes.
CI/PG maintains liaison with the Office of Public
Safety, Agency for International Development (OPS/AID)
and its training facility, the International Police Academy
(IPA). CI/PG also administers and supervises Project
IDEN-171 and its training proprietary facility IDEN-172.
In addition, CI/PG coordinates a joint OPS/AID Technical
Services Division, Central Intelligence Agency (TSC/CIA)
Technical Investigations Course. CI/PG provides guidance
and counsel to the Area Divisions in matters pertaining
to police/security functions and activities. Specific
details of these functions are as follows:
LIAISON WITH OPS/AID
CI/PG liaison with OPS/AID and IPA is conducted on a
daily basis and consists principally of:
a. exchange of information on IPA participants, some
of whom later attend IDEN-172 courses and who are
of interest to Agency components,
b. arranging for inclusion of Agency sponsored partici-
pants in IPA/OPS/AID training programs,
c. arranging for IPA/OPS/AID briefings and tours for
foreign police/security representatives sponsored
by CIA Area Divisions,
d. obtaining biographic and assessment data on
IPA/OPS/AID trainees,
e. providing general information pertaining to
police/security organizations, activities, equip-
ment, and personalities requested by Agency
operating components,
f. coordinating the Agency's participation in the
Technical Investigations Course designed to
familiarize the trainees with the techniques
required to properly investigate terrorist
activities wherein explosives have been utilized,
g. arranging contact between Desk officers and OPS/AID
sponsored participants.
PROJECT IDEN-171 PROPRIETARY IDEN-172
IDEN-172 Training Academy is a commercial enterprise.
It was incorporated under the laws of the State of Maryland
in 1952 and conducts its business in the District of
Columbia. It is engaged principally in training foreign
police/security personnel and selling police/security equipment
and training programs and briefings to foreign
police/security personnel and organizations. IDEN-172 also
provides special training programs and briefings to
foreign police/security personnel of interest to Agency
operating divisions. It provides biographic and assessment
data on trainees to country desks. Recently IDEN-172 has
acquired the capability of providing training to foreign
police/security personnel in VIP protective security
for Chiefs of State.
CI/PG does not maintain direct contact or liaison
with any law enforcement organization, local or federal
at home or abroad. When the need arises, such contact is
sometimes made on our behalf by OPS/AID or IDEN-172.
OPS/AID has such contacts at home and abroad because of
the nature of its activities (training of foreign police/security personnel at home
and abroad), and its Public Safety programs around the
world. IDEN-172 has such contacts at home--local and
federal levels--because its personnel are personally
acquainted with law enforcement officers throughout the
United States. Members of the IDEN-172 staff have appeared as guest lecturers at such local
institutions as the U.S. Park Police, IPA, the U.S.
Secret Service, and the U.S. Treasury Enforcement Division.
In addition to the liaison mentioned in the
previous paragraph, the Agency maintains liaison in varying
degrees with foreign police/security organizations through
its field stations. The existence and extent thereof,
however, is a decision to be made by the Area Division,
and is not the responsibility of CI/PG.
The CIA station as a member of the Country Team in
may have had some contact with Jan
Hitrione, who was murdered by the Tupamaros. Dan Citrione,
an experienced and respected law enforcement officer, was
a bona fide OPS/AID officer assigned to the AID mission
in Uruguay, and was never a CIA employee or agent.
The MHCHAOS program is a worldwide program for
clandestine collection abroad of information on foreign
efforts to support/encourage/exploit/manipulate domestic
U.S. extremism, especially by Cuba, Communist China,
North Vietnam, the Soviet Union, North Korea and the
Arab fedayeen.
The MHCHAOS program has not and is not conduct-
ing efforts domestically for internal domestic collection
purposes. Agency efforts are foreign. Foreign-oriented
activity in the United States has been of two types:
a. Selected FBI domestic sources who travel
abroad in connection with their extremist activity
and/or affiliations to make contact with hostile
foreign powers or with foreign extremist groups
have been briefed and debriefed by Headquarters
officers. The briefing has included appropriate
operational guidance, including defensive advice.
b. Americans with existing extremist creden-
tials have been assessed, recruited, tested and
dispatched abroad for PCS assignments as contract
agents, primarily sources offered for such use by
the FBI. When abroad they collect information re-
sponsive to MHCHAOS program requirements, as well
as other Agency requirements. They are thus used
primarily for targeting against Cubans, Chinese Com-
munists, the North Vietnamese, etc., as their back-
ground and their particular access permits. It
should be noted that the MPTROIKA aspect of the
MPLODESTAR project of the East Asia Division is
similar to the MHCHAOS PROGRAM.
As indicated earlier, MHCHAOS is a foreign pro-
gram, conducted overseas, except for the limited activity
described above. The program is and has been managed so
as to achieve the maximum feasible utilization of exist-
ing resources of the Operations Directorate. No assets
have been recruited and run exclusively for the MHCHAOS
program. Instead, emphasis has been placed on the exploi-
tation of new and old Agency assets who have a by-product
capability or a concurrent capability for provision of
information responsive to the program's requirements.
This has involved the provision of custom-tailored collec-
tion requirements and operational guidance. This collec-
tion program is viewed as an integral part of the recruit-
ment and collection programs of China Operations, Vietnam
Operations, Cuban Operations, Soviet Bloc Division opera-
tions and Korean Branch operations. Agents who have an
American "Movement" background or who have known connec-
tions with the American "Movement" are useful as access
agents to obtain biographic and personality data, to dis-
cern possible vulnerabilities and susceptibilities, and
to develop operationally exploitable relationships with
recruitment targets of the above programs. These assets
are of interest to our targets because of their connec-
tions with and/or knowledge of the American "Movement."
Over the course of the MHCHAOS program, there have been
approximately 20 important areas of operational interest,
which at the present time have been reduced to about ten:
Paris, Stockholm, Brussels, Dar Es Salaam, Conakry, Algiers,
Mexico City, Santiago, Ottawa and Hong Kong.
The MHCHAOS program also utilizes audio opera-
tions, two of which have been implemented to cover tar-
gets of special interest.
MHCHAOS reporting from abroad relating to the
program originates in two ways: Individuals who are noted
in contact with Cubans, the Chinese Communists, etc., and
who appear to have extremist connections, interests or
background are reported upon. Other individuals are re-
ported upon in response to specific Headquarters require-
ments received from the FBI because such individuals are
of active investigatory security interest to the FBI.
All cable and dispatch traffic related to the
MHCHAOS program is sent via restricted channels. It is
not processed by either the Cable Secretariat or the In-
formation Services Division. The control and retriev-
ability of information obtained, including information
received from the FBI, is the responsibility of the Spe-
cial Operations Group.
Information responsive to specific FBI require-
ments is disseminated to the FBI via special controlled
dissemination channels, i.e., by restricted handling cable
traffic or via special pouch and specially numbered blind
memoranda.
Information of particular significance, when col-
lected, has been disseminated by special memorandum over
the signature of the Director of Central Intelligence to
the White House (Dr. Kissinger and John Dean), as well as
to the Attorney General, the Secretary of State and the
Director of the FBI.
Foreign Resources Division Operational
Activities with Possible Flap Potential
At the risk of stating the obvious, almost all of the operational
activities carried on by FR Division in the United States run the risk
that unauthorized disclosure could create embarrassment to the Agency.
We have accepted this as a condition precedent and have proceeded with
our operational activities in the most professional manner possible under
