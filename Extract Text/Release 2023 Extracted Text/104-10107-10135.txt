1. A meeting was held on 27 January 1969 with Messrs.
Rocca, Houston, Warner and myself to discuss the ramifications
of the confrontation with the New York FBI office on 17 January.
It was concluded that additional information was required on
03(Thomas L. Roberts) and (
I contacted the Director
of Security and requested the security files on these two individuals
and was advised that we could not have the security files but that
Mr. Ward Greene would bring the files to the office and discuss
their contents openly.
03 2. On 29 January, Mr. Greene brought the security files
on (Roberts) and and was most cooperative in explaining
their contents. Attached is a chronological rundown on the
pertinent information on Thomas (T L. Roberts' R erts affiliation with
the FBI, CIA and Itkin.

3. On 30 January a meeting was held with Messrs. Houston,
Warner, Rocca, and
CCS/LPGLOBE, to discuss
the operational use of Mr. Roberts. Mr. Roberts has been a
Staff Agent of CIA since 28 August 1961. From March 1964 to
November 1964 he spent time in West Africa) writing a monograph
on West est African legal) problems. 10 It should be noted that this
task was performed under a grant from a foundation which was
blown in the MHDOWEL exposures. In November 1964 (Roberts) 03
was assigned for Cover to the C
staff where he remained until March 1965 and then went
to (Dakar.

The facts in the attached chronology are subject to
question since they are the result of (Roberts) own explanation of
his affiliation with Itkin rather than having been determined from
independent sources. The most critical aspect would appear to
be the knowledge or suspicion that Itkin may have known of
03 Roberts) affiliation with CIA.
This knowledge is borne out by
02
name
the strange way in which Itkin repeatedly brings (Roberts)'
into the story which Itkin develops about his CIA affiliations.
One of the questions to be answered by CP GLOBE personnel is
whether or not (Roberts) reported his activities with Itkin in Geneva,
Switzerland, in March 1966. There appears to be no record of
03(Roberts having explained why he never pursued the Itkin debt or
what his financial contribution was to the

5. Mr. Rocca was advised by Mr. Sam Papich of the FBI
that the New York District Attorney may be considering prosecution
against (Robert for having absconded with funds received from
negligence cases. We do not have sufficient information to evaluate
the likelihood of criminal prosecution. It may be necessary to
discuss this problem with representatives of Mr. Hogan's office.

there appear to have been

two operational considerations, one having been a request to use
him with Project DTPILLAR from November 1953 to February
1955, and then a request in 1963 by the Domestic Operations
Division for his use on Project WUBRINY. In March 1964 DO
Division advised Security that (
was not going to be used
on WUBRINY. Mr. Rocca commented that there are some rather
ominous allegations against members of the firm of (
) indicating that one member of the firm was a card-
carrying member of the Communist Party. At the present time
Mr. Rocca is investigating the DTPILLAR use of Mr.(
