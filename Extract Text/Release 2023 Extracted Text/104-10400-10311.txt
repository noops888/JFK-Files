AT RECEPTION AT HOME OF CHARGE NIGHT OF 11 JANUARY,
REPRESENTATIVE ADDABBO MADE POINT OF TELLING COS THAT STATION
BRIEFING AS PER REF WAS "DAMN. GOOD" AND THAT HE APPRECIATED THE
FRANK ANSWERS TO THE DELEGATION'S QUESTIONS.
2,
MR. SNODGRASS ALSO VOLUNTERRED THAT THE BRIEFING HAD
IMPACTED FAVORABLY ON THE DELEGATION AND THAT THEY WERE SURPRISED
AND PLEASED TO GET SUCH STRAIGHTFORWARD ANSWERS TO THEIR QUESTIONS..
HE ADDED THAT WHAT OFTEN GAVE HIM TROUBLE WAS STATEMENTS BY
AGENCY OFFICERS THAT THEY HAD BEEN PURSUING SOVIET OFFICIALS FOR
TEN YEARS OR MORE AND HAD NOT YET RECRUITED ONE. HE ALLUDED TO
THIS AS THE BUREAUCRAT'S DREAM, BEING PERPETUALLY PAID FOR SEEKING
THE HOLY GRAIL WITHOUT EVER FINDING IT. COS POINTED OUT TO MR.
SNUDGRASS THAT SOVIETS WERE BEING RECRUITED AND THAT THE WORK
OF UNE STATION. WHICH MIGHT NOT HESULT IN RECRUITMENT WOULD BE

RECRUITMENT APPROACH, IN COST EFFECTIVENESS TERMS, ALSO POINTED
OUT THAT THE RECRUITMENT OF A SINGLE SOVIET COULD AND DOES RESULT
IN A MORE ACCURATE APPRAISAL OF THE SOVIET THREAT AND THUS A MORE
RELIST IC ALLOCATION OF FUNDS TO MEET IT. MR. SNOD GRASS ADMITTED
THAT THIS WAS SO BUT ADDED HIS UPINION THAT MORE RATHER THAN LESS
CONGRESSIONAL CONTACT WITH CIA FIELD PERSONNEL AS IN
WOULD BE A PLUS FOR THE AGENCY AND GIVE THE CONGRESS A BETTER
FEEL FOR OUR ENDEA VORS AND PROBLEMS.

MR. CAREY ALSO SAID THAT ON THE BASIS OF HIS TALKS WITH
MEMBERS OF THE DELEGATION IT APPEARED THAT THE BRIEFING HAD GONE
