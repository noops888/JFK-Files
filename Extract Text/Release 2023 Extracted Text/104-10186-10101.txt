3. In May 1962 an untested source, who was then a member of the MPD,
said that CASTRO was probably Secretary of Workers' Affairs_on
the Central Committee of the MPD. (See CS-3/511,325). An official
Jamaican service reported in CS-3/561,001 that CASTRO arrived in
Kingston, Jamaica, on 18 September 1963 en route to Habana as a
delegate to attend the Seventh Congress of the International Union
of Architects, to be held from 29 September to 3 October 1963.
His passport, No. 115933, issued on 10 September 1963, stated
that he was born on 5 May 1928 in Santo Domingo and that he was
an industrial employee. In December 1963 an untested source, a
member of the MPD, reported that the first rebel groups under
the direction of the IMPD had been formed at Hato Mayor and at
El Seibo, in the eastern part of the Dominican Republic, and that
the Rato Mayor group, composed of about 150 men from all leftist
parties, was under the leadership of Roman Baldemiro CASTRO.
(See TDCS 3/567,279). In October 1964 CASTRO is reported to have
returned to the Dominican Republic from Cuba. (See CS-311/06078-64).
CASTRO is married to Ana Mercedes ESPINAL, and they have six
children.
