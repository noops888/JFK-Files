and the place was coming apart.
Mr. Wides. Prior to your leaving, and in connection with
your preparations and briefings and discussions at Headquarters,
had there been any discussion at all with you or that you were
aware of regarding the possible assassination of Patrice
Lumumba?
Mr. Hedgman. Absolutely none. I can say that that is

Mr. Wides.
And then you had been there a short while, I
3
take it, and in about the last week of July, when Patrice
Lumumba and others from the Congo came to the United States, I
5
believe around the 26th of July, am I correct, that both you and
6
the Ambassador returned to America?
7
Mr. Hedgman. That's correct.
8
Mr. Wides.
And during 'your return here, in any discussions
9
you had with officials at CIA or other government officials.
10
11
did you have any discussions or learn of any discussions
regarding the possible assassination of Patrice Lumumba?

12
Mr. lledgman.
No, sir, I did not.

Mr Wides.
And then you returned to the Congo?

Mr. Hedgman.
Yes.
I believe we returned on the 6th of

15
August, if memory serves me.
16
Mr. Wides. Now, as a very brief background for the
17
next series of questions, is it correct that by early September,
that is by the 5th of 6th, Patrice Lumumba had been dismissed
19
as Premier and the U.S. had already become seriously concerned
410 First Street, S... Washington, D.C. 20003

to be a Soviet effort to take over the Congo.
Mr. Wides. And because of conflict between among, I
guess, is the appropriate word because of conflict, or
potential conflict, among the central government under
President Kasavubu and others as one faction, Patrice Lumumba
and his followers as a second faction, and Mr. Tshombe and
7
8
his follwers as a third
9
Mr. Iledgman.
And Gizenga as a fourth.
10
Mr. Wides.
Gizenga, I take it he was somewhat within
11
Lumumba's camp?
12
Mr. Hedgman. Yus. I'm sorry. I should not have

interrupted.
14
Mr Wides. In any event, there was the potential of

imminent fratricidal war?

22
Mr. Hedgman. Tshombe had already declared the Katanga
to be an independent state of Katanga on the 11th of July, if
memory sarves me.
Mr. Wides. Is it also correct that Mr. Lumumba was the
person of those three leaders, of those three factions, whose
potential activities concerned the United States the most at
that point, particularly with regard to the possibility of
Communist influence in the Congo?

In early September, did you receive a message from lHead-

channel indicating it was for your eyes only at the Station, and
telling you that a messenger whom you would recognize would be
arriving with a mission for you?
11
12
Mr. Hedgman. I believe, yes, I received such a message.
Mr. Wides. When, would you please state

Mr. Hedgman. And I believe that was the general thrust
of the wording. I cannot, at this time, affirm with absolute

beginning of September, but I cannot pin it down more than
within a week or ten days.
Mr. Wides. About how long before the mussenger arrived
would you say the cable came, if you can recall?
Mr. Hadgman. I cannot recall definitively. I would quess,
and I would just guess, a few days.
Mr. Wides. And is it accurate that the thrust of the

Mr. Baron. Can you state in your own words just exactly
what the gist of that cable was?
Mr. Hedgman. I am not sure that it will be exact or
even close, but it is my I am going again, and I stress this
time now on recollection, and it is not a sure thing, but my
recollection was that the cable advised me that a person whom
I would know to be or recognize as an officer of the Agency,
and I am not sure that it said as an officer of the Agency,
someone who I would have recognized would arrive with instruc-
16 tions for me.
Mr. Wides. Did the cable refer in any way to Lumumba
17
!e
that you can recall, that would involve the Lumumba problem or

20
not refer to Lumumba in any way.

reference or slug, I believe is the term?

Mr. Hedgman. I think, I am guessing about that. I think

indicate the special handling. I believe the message also was

and contained instructions that I was not

9
Mr. Baron. And that you ware to destroy the message?
Mr. Hedgman. Not at that time。
10
11

you sent thereafter to the leadquarters in connection with the
impending visit were to be given the same slug or

19
Mr. Hedgman. I am assuming that it probably did, but I
cannot be 100 percent certain. I dont recall sending a message
until after I met the gentleman concerned.
Mr. Dawson. Maybe we could approach that a different way.
You do recall whatever message you received was not in the norma
course of communications with the Agency?
Mr. Hedgman. Well, it came through Agency communications
