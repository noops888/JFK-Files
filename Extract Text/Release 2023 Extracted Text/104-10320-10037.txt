Dear W
Your Melbourne Station has sought my views
on the possibility of declassifying a Warren Commission
document in which reference is made to the "Australian
security service". The document in question is CD.971
dated 22nd May, 1964, together with an attachment dated
29th November, 1963.
I would recommend strongly that CD,971 and
Its attachment should not on any account be declassified or
publicly released for reasons which include the following :
(i) It has never been officially stated that there
is a "C.I.A. Canberra Station" or that
there are C.I.A. officers in Australia.
This has been avoided as a point of policy.
(ii) Publication of these facts would invoke a
spate of questions by the Press and in the
Parliament, which would be contrary to the
national security interest, for example :
(a) Who approved the establishment of
the "C.I.A. Canberra Station"?
(b) What is its composition and location?
(c) What is its purpose in Australia?
(Allegations have already been made
that C.I.A. is interfering in Aust-
ralian domestic affairs.)
(d) With what Australian agencies does it
deal?
