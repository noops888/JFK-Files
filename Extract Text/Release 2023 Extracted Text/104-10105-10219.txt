3. Early in 1969, a prototype Ingram submachinegun manufactured by
SIONICS Incorporated, the predecessor of Military Armament Corporation,
with which Subject was also associated, was demonstrated to SOD. The
company's solicitation for purchase orders was unsuccessful, the asking
price of more than $1,400 having been considered excessive. There is no
record of the identity of the SIONICS Incorporated representative with
whom SOD was in contact at that time nor whether, in fact, there was
direct contact. A memorandum from the former Chief, SOD, Mr. F. P. Holcomb,
to Chief, WH Division concerning Subject indicates there was no contact,
at least with Subject.
4. There is no information on record with this office concerning
a Colonel Bayard.
