HIROYUKI TOLD REVUELTA THAT RECRUITMENT OF JAPANESE CREWS WOULD BE...
FEASIBLE IF THE CONTRACT TERMS WERE ATTRACTIVE.
4. THE LATEST PROPOSAL SUBMITTED BY REVUELTA TO JAAEC OFFICIALS
CALLS FOR A TRIANGULAR ROUTE LINKING JAPAN, CUBA, AND CHINA. UNDER
THIS PROPOSAL, A JAPANESE SHIP WOULD CARRY JAPANESE EXPORTS TO CUBA,
LOAD SUGAR IN CUBA FOR SHIPMENT TO CHINA AND JAPAN, PROCEED TO CHINA
TO UNLOAD SUGAR FOR CHINA AND LOAD CHINESE EXPORTS TO JAPAN, AND THEN
RETURN TO JAPAN.
:
5. WHEN UMEHARA TOLD A MITSUI LINE OFFICIAL OF REVUELTA'S LATEST
PROPOSAL, THE SHIPPING OFFICIAL COMMENTED THAT THE IDEA WAS INTERESTING.
HE THOUGHT THAT THE VOLUME OF SUGAR SHIPMENTS TO CHINA AND JAPAN
WOULD BE ENOUGH TO OFFSET THE SMALL VOLUME OF CARGO BETWEEN JAPAN
AND CUBA, BUT EXPRESSED DOUBT OVER THE AVAILABILITY OF SUFFICIENT
CARGO TO MAKE THE CHINA-JAPAN LEG OF THE TRIANGULAR ROUTE PROFITABLE
FOR JAPANESE SHIPPING COMPANIES.
