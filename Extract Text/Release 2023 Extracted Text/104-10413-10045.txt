2023 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
10 January 1953
Request for eneral of Project! ΙENVOY
1. It is requested that the LIENVCY Freject be renched for the period.
1 February 1963 through 31 January 19h for a total of 17,000; 19,210 for
100 and 29,250 for 1904.
2. The liaison chamel of this project to LIDLEGANT, LIERGO, and the
Fresident of Lexico was particularly worthwhile during the past year in
making arrangements for the trip of Fresident Remedy to Rexico from 29 June
to 1 July and at the time of the Cuban crisis in October 1962. The Chief of
Station was given permission to give President LOPDG Mateos a special brief-
ing on Soviet missile bases in Cuba and special photographs were shom to
him. In view of Mexico's important position in the "neutralist non-inter-
vention" camp of Latin American countries, the ready access to Fresident
LOPEZ Mateos, through the 303 who has built up an excellent rapport, isan
invaluable asset for ODYOKE policy makers. The present Ambassador has chosen
to use this channel on several occasions.
3. The Station passes to the Fresident FBRAND material after proper
editing. These are given him promptly so that the information will be
timely, and he has shown great interest in this weekly briefing. In fact,
he has asked for special briefings, and one such report on the India-Red
Chinese border war was prepared for him. On his trip to the Far East in
October 1902, he asked for special briefings on communism and important
personalities who were communists or pro-communists in three countries he
planned to visit; Indonesia, Japan, and India. They were prepared by
31/TCG and forwarded to the Station for translation and passage to the
Fresident.
a. The joint tap conter which provides coverage of 30 lines, is one of
the most important sources of positive intelligence and CI information for
Mexico. The Station is provided with the take from these lines on a daily
basis. There is a KUBARK Staff Agent, Arnold F. AREHART (ps), who spends
full time in the LP, and is responsible for complete maintenance of all the
CHOPET
13-00000
equipment and for controlling KUBARK interests in this phase of the Froject.
5. With regard to events which might be considered as bearing on the
security of this project, the Station reported that on 15 June 1962, at
approximately 0930, the concierge noticed two men standing directly across
the street from the LF and who seemed to have an unusual interest in the
activity of the LF. After about an hour both got in an automobile and con-
tinued to watch the building from the car, and from time to time appeared
to be taking notes on the comings and goings of the installations, as well.
as making notes on the cars used by the personnel of the LF. They attempted
to follow one LF employee when he left for lunch. Later that day, LIENVOY-2
and LIENVOY-11, approached one of the two surveillance men and asked for an
explanation of his action that day. They also asked him to identify himself.
He showed them a driver's license with the name Mariano VERA Gonzalez. This
information was checked at the Department of Traffic and found to be the
license of another person. The Traffic Department was staked out to deter-
mine who, if anyone, might show an interest in the names and addresses of
the cars used by LP personnel. On the 16th of June, an agent of the Secret
Service of the Folice Headquarters showed up and tried to obtain information
about the owner of the license plates on LIENVOY-2's car. The stake-out
employee and Secret Service man checked the traffic files, but the information
was not there. In conversation with the Secret Service man, information was
gained which led the Station to suspect that he was a member of an investi-
gative group headed by a Mexican whose aim is to obtain political information
for Mexican politicians. Since the 15th, no further attempts to place the
LP under observation have been noted. Any problems such as this can be
handled, if necessary, by the COS and his government contacts since this is
a joint venture.
6. During the past project year, there have been 236 disseminations
based on LIENVOY and LIENVOY-2 information: 200 from the former and 36
from the latter. LIENVOY reporting covered such topics as:
a. Activities of Mexican leftists such as Lazaro CARDENAS, Jorge
L. TAMAYO, Vicente LOMBARDO Toledano.
b. World Peace Council.
c.
Soviet and Czech activities in Mexico.
:
d. Activities of Soviet and Czech officials in Mexico.
e.
National Liberation Movement (MLN).
13-00000
f. Cuban commercial activities in Mexico, and transshipment of
goods to Cuba.
٤٠ Activities in Cuba and Cuban activities in Mexico.
h. Mexican Communist Party.
i. Popular Socialist Farty.
:
j. Clandestine Communist propaganda and periodicals.
k. Coverage of activity in Mexico of interest to KUBARK in
connection with the trip of President Kennedy.
1. Travel of persons of interest.
LIENVOY-2's informants provided reports covering such topics as the following:
a. Communist Party activities in Mexico.
b. Anti-government propaganda and activity.
c. National Liberation Hovement.
d. Anti-U.S. activity in the National University.
e.
Developments in Mexico of interest regarding the trip of
President Kennedy.
7. WH Division supports the attached renewal request for Project
LIENVOY submitted by the Mexico City Station. This project is considered
one of the Station's most productive sources of positive, operational and
CI information. Also, it provides a alandestine Channel to the President
of Mexico for both the Station and the Ambassador.
13-00000
REQUEST FOR PROJECT LIENVOY RENEWAL
A. Current Objectives.
The objectives of this project remain the same as those stated in
the last renewal request. The project continues to provide the Mexico
Station with a smooth and rapid channel to Mexico's highest political
figures. The Principal Agent continues to be a close associate of Pres LOPEZ
Mateos The intercept center has undergone no major changes during
the past year.
•
1. RNDM-6 Objectives Priority A, 1. a; Priority A, 4, a, b, c;
and Priority B, 2 and 3 continue to be effectively covered by this
project. Cordial and friendly relations continue between
Government of Mexico leaders and the Chief of Station, Mexico.
During the past year, the Chief of Station, Mexico, at the
request of the Chief, ODACID, Mexico, has held a number of covert
meetings with President to convey ODYOKE policy matters. The
Chief, ODACID, remains pleased with this access to Mexican officials.
2. All Soviet and Czechoslovak
installations in
Mexico City are covered by this project. The Case Officer
for Soviet Operations and the Case Officer for Soviet Satellite
Operations rely heavily on this product for operational leads
and data to support double agent operations.
3. All major anti-PBPRIME elements in Mexico City are
covered by this project.
4. Targets of opportunity which appear to be hostile or
critical to PEPRIME or to the present Government of Mexico are
covered by this project.
All major objectives of the project are being effectively realized.
B. Changes.
At a yet to be determined date, it is planned to move the intercept
center from its present location. Two reasons are behind this move:
1) security, since the present base has been used for almost three years:
and 2) to provide the center with more mobile equipment. Such equipment
is now under consideration by KURIOT and when it becomes available, an
amendment to this project will be forwarded requesting approval for the
transfer of the intercept center.

C. Intelligence Production.
The activities report forwarded to Headquarters each month lists
the intelligence reports received from this project. During 1962 there
were 534 intelligence reports produced by this project which were
forwarded to Headquarters through 1 December 1962. All of these
concerned RMDM-6 reporting priorities and current requirements levied
by Headquarters and the ODACID installation.
In addition, this project produces a large amount of information
which is not disseminated on a current basis but is reported to ODACID,
ODENVY and other ODYOKE agencies in reply to a steady stream of routine
file trace requests. These file trace requests run into the thousands
each month. It would be difficult to determine the exact percentage of
the information produced by LIENVOY; but in many instances involving
prominent Mexican Government officials, large portions of the file came
to us through LIENVOY coverage.
D. Effectiveness.
The LIENVOY project provides the Station with a channel to the
highest level of the Mexican Government which is both effective and
rapid as well as covert. The Station continues to receive the daily
"resumen" highlights from the thirty (30) lines covered. A high
percentage of current intelligence is disseminated from these daily
reports. In addition, full transcripts are received on Soviet and
Czech
lines and on any of the thirty targets we may request. A good
part of this is personality data useful only to KUBARK and in some cases
to ODENVY. In addition, the project provides a support mechanism for
covering targets of interest to KUBARK or other ODYOKE agencies.
E. Problems.
There have been no significant security, cover, control or liaison
problems during the past year.
F. Liaison.
From a liaison point of view, the Station believes that this project
contributes greatly to the present friendly attitude of the Mexican
Government leaders toward ODYOKE policies. The liaison remains
clandestine in nature though contacts between the Chief of Station and Pres LOFE?
Mateos are usually made at the request of the Chief, ODACID, Mexico.
G.. Interagency Coordination.
The Chicf, ODACID, Mexico, is the only ODYOKE representative in
Mexico outside KUBARK who is aware of this project. His role has been
13-00000
explained above and the coordination with KUEARK is excellent.
H. Plans.
No significant operational changes are recommended for the next
project year. Subject to the continuation of the present Mexican
officials in their current positions, the project will not be changed.
I. Costs.
1. For the past period.
The cost of the project (paid by Mexico Station exclusive of
Headquarters costs) from 1 February 1962 through 30 June 1962 was
US $16,253.00 and from 1 July 1962 through 30 November 1962 (actual)

J. Annex.
The equipment and Headquarters technical support furnished this
project during the past year has been commendable. A project amendment
will be submitted requesting additional equipment for the transfer of
the intercept center as soon as modifications and estimates are known.
K. Emergency Conditions.
Should a crisis require the evacuation of the KUBARK staff agent
working inside the Intercept Center, contact can be maintained with
LIELEGANT at his clandestine apartment. This address is retained at
the Mexico Station. If the contact is not made by Willard C. CURTIS,
the use of his name should be sufficient introduction. LIENVOY/2 could
be contacted in the same manner at his home in Mexico City.
