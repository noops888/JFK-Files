NAME CHECK
1. This Agency was recently in receipt of information from
Spanish service on Subject which may be of interest to the addressees.
It is as follows
211320
Beclassify OADR
12-15-93
LISA-
Subject was born on 5 August 1910 in the Province of
Castalon, Spain, the son of Miguel and Teresa, who
then had a permanent residence in Monrovia, Liberia.
He carries a Spanish National Identity document
#36989661; place of issuance illegible. It is reported
that Subject was formerly a Colonel in the American
Air Force but lost his retirement pension from the
USAP because of his work as an Air Force instructor in
Venezuela during the reign of Marcos Perez Jimenez. He
is divorced and has a son residing in Canada, also a
pilot in the USAF.
Subject, who is presently residing in the Canary Islands,
drew attention to himself when it was revealed he carried
both Spanish and "North American" passports. He appeared
to have plenty of money but lived alone and avoided all
social contact.
2. If there is any information on Subject in the files of
the addressees, it would be appreciated if it would be forwarded-
to this Agency.
*This is assumed to mean United States, but our report referred only
to "North American".
