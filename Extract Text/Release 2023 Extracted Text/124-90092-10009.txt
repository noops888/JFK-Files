As you know, the Bureau, of course, can make no objection to the
establishment of such liaison. For your confidential information, however,
information has been received at the Seat of Government that a CIA liaison
representative will be placed in Canada within the next few weeks
of CIA have confidentially advised the Bureau's Liaison Section that they
readily recognize that it will take years to build up a close liaison with
the RCMPd related organizations They state, however, that they feel such
(U) action must be taken in view of CIA'S jurisdiction in foreign circles

For your further information, it has been ascertained that CIA is
presently considering one (Samuel Herman Horton, Samuel Herman Horton, former Bureau agent and
now an employee of the Office of Special Operations, CIA, for the position
(U) in question Horton entered the Bureau as a Special Agent on January 15,
1940.He was assigned to the Richment and Cincinnati Offices and was trans-
ferred to the Seat of Government on June 28, 1943. He resigned on December

It has additionally been ascertained that William K. Harvey, also

confidence and use you as an entree with the RCMP and other excellent Bureau
contacts. The recommendation was also specifically made that "due to your
peculiar personality" Horton should be the new Canadian representative
because of his so-called "ability to handle people," meaning of course, that
he is expected to cultivate and properly handle you for the benefit of CIA.
It is therefore quite evident that CIA personnel are not only unfairly
judging you, but also have every intention of using you as a "stepping-Stone"
for their own designs.
This information is being pointed out to you so that you may be
completely aware of the situation. You should be particularly alert to prevent
being used as any such "stepping-stone" for CIA or Horton. CIA should develop
its own contacts without depending ling upon the excellent relationships already
established between the FBI and Canadian official channels Only that liaison
necessary for the coordination of domestic and foreign matters is necessary and
it should be most circumspect.
