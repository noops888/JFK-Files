AND CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTIES ARE UNLIKELY TO DEFEAT PREMIER HORO
IN THE PARLIAMENTARY VOTE OF DONF IDEMES NEXT WEEK, BUT THEY MAY
RAISE SERIOUS DOUBTS ABOUT THE VIABILITY OF THE COALITION. RECENT
LEFTUING SOCIALIST AGITATION FOR MORE INFLUENCIAL POSTS WITHIN THE
PARTY'S HIERARCHY WAS APPAR PPARELY MECCSSFUL AND SOME PSI DIE-HARDE
MAY- RISK EXPULSION BY VOTING AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT. OVER THE LONG
RUN, THE KEY FACTOR MAY BE THE ATTITUDE OF CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC
RIGHT-WINGERS WILOSE DEFECTION WOULD LESSEN MORO'S MANEUVERABILITY.//
