operations from MR. BISSELL. Approximately 15 million dollars were required
to finance Cuban operations for the fiscal year and a balance of 1083/4 was

were (1) political action, (2) propaganda, (3) paramilitary, (4) intelligence
collection, (5) counterintelligence, (6) communications support, (7) support.
"This matter should be laid before the appropriate higher authori-

Nestor SANCHEZ (a Spanish-speaking case officer from Headquarters
acting as
case officer for AMLASH-1) cabled that AMLASH-1 "was insistent upon meeting with
a senior U.S. official, preferably. Robert F. KENNEDY, for assurances of U.S. moral
support" (88) for AMLASH's activities in Cuba. SANCHEZ recommended that "Highest
and profound consideration be given" (88) because AMLASH-1 was determined to attempt
an operation against Castro "with or without U.S. support" (88).

JACK STEWART, an officer assigned to the Mexico City station, met in
Mexico City with a high officer in the Cuban armed forces who was subsequently
to become a CIA asset known as A.M. LASH-1. STEWART met with A.M. LASH to
sound out his views on the Cuban situation. A.M. LASH was in Mexico City to
attend a "leftist-sponsored" conference. (78).
The March 1961 meeting was inconclusive, but it led to other meetings out
of which Project A.M.LASH was created. A.M. LASH-1 "repeatedly insisted that
the essential first step in overthrowing the regime was the elimination of
CASTRO himself, which /A.M. LASH-17 claimed he was prepared to accomplish. He
repeatedly requested that we /CIA furnish him the special equipment or material
needed to do the job." (79).
The IG REPORT concludes that: "The Agency offered both direct and indirect
support for /A.M. LASII's7 plottings" (80) Gontinued on next card)
