1. I had an opportunity to discuss Luis Kutner
with a reliable and discreet source on 16 Feb 62 who
knows Kutner vell. His assessment of Kutner is as
follows.
اگر
2. Kutner is a highly intelligent, over-stimulated
Individual. He is inclined to accept stories as being
true without confirming. He exaggerates and seeks to
embellish. He will use every trick and angle "in the book"
and anyone he can to further his efforts. If he does a
favor for anyone he wants a favor in turn - sooner or later.
He looks for publicity and recognition and will use anyone
to accomplish this.
3. He was vas very active during the Kefauver hearings
and, according to source, furnished unreliable information.

27 December-190
CHI-61-1483
1. I have learned through a local bank that Luis Rutner
had an account there until September 1960, when it was c
out. A fov months prior to the closing Kitner vas trying to
borrow $10,000; the bank vould not loan it to him, settings
limit of $2,000.
2. In 1954 he was shown as a partner - with K.L. Braun,
208 South LaSalle Street - in a company called American Dodus-
trial Enterprise. In 1955 he was involved in trying to to obtain
letter of credit from the Bank of China to sell tanks and
other machinery to the Central Trust Division of Chinese ePro P
curement through a company called Productos Latinos Americanos.
3. The bank gọt curious about Kutner and his activities
one time and thought of making inquiries concerning him of
the Chicago Crime Commission
From a local friend in a large department store
learned Kutner is married (wife Rose), lives at 1431 Ridge
Avenue, Evanston, Illinois, and has a son and a daughter. His
billa are paid promptly.
I have heard a rumor, repeat rumor, that Kitner is
close friend of Maggie Daly, a local gossip columnist.
The American Bar Association informed me Kutner is
hamber in good standing" g" born 1908, a 1930 graduate of
Chicago University Lav School and has offices at 105 West Ad
Street. Bere he becomes a little little mysterious, for a check made de
the Uni University revealed a "forser student named Luis Pyrtrea
Kutner, a non-graduate, employed as an associate attorney at
105 West Adams Street". He has no as no degree according to Univer
sity recards we checked, either bachelor's or lav.
7. Roger White is attempting to learn more about Runner
