SUBJECT:
Theory re MOSKALEV, Yuriy Ivanovich and
Unidentified Man
That Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV might be identifiable with
the "unidentified man" going into and coming out of the Soviet
Embassy in Mexico City in October 1963. The "unidentified man"
was recently identified by SLIPSTREAM as a KGB type by name of
"Yuri" whom he knew in Moscow in 1964.
According to travel records MOSKALEV was in the
USSR in 1964.; in the U.S. in October 1963
•
MOSKALEV functions officially as a Soviet scientist
and often attends international conferences. He
has been in contact with known GRU Soviet diplomat in
the U.S.
MOSKALEV bears a striking resemblance to composite of
"Saul" in book Appointment in Dallas who claims he was involved
in the assassination of President Kennedy. "Saul" claims:
he crossed border into U.S. illegally and was in
Dallas on 20 November.
That he had been to Mexico City, had a contact in
Soviet Embassy there, in 1963, and that he knew the
identity of OSWALD because he (OSWALD) had been
fingered to him in Mexico City.

τ

that OSWALD was involved in the Kennedy assassination
plot, but that he, "Saul", fired shots that killed
Kennedy.
that two hours after the assassination he, "Saul",
was out of the U.S. That he used limp as a
disguise.
QUESTIONS
1. Could MOSKALEV be "Saul"?
2.
3.
Could MOSKALEV, therefore, be mystery man who
boarded plane in Mexico City for Havana on 22
November 1963?
Was assassination a Soviet comspiracy without
Cuban knowledge?
RECOMMENDATION
1. Can we obtain voice tape of MOSKALEV, since he
has delivered speeches at scientific conferences
in U.S. and abroad?
2.
If so, could we arrange to have McDonald (unwittingly)
hear it, to see if he recognizes it as that of "Saul"?

1.
Can we find hote that PENKOVSKY identified of
MOSKALEVSKIY.
2.
May I see PENKOVSKIY's 201 file for period 61-63?
3.
Get photos and check out MOISEEV and BABKOV.
4.
Via CI Staff, find out if we can show photo to DERYABIN
and ROSTVOROFF?
5.
Could MOSKALEV be Dept 13? Could OSWALD have met with
him in Mexico City clandestinely in 1963?

Re International Conference on Diagnosis
and Treatment of Radioactive Poisoning,
Vienna, Aust. 15-18 Oct 62. "Most
interesting aspect of meeting was conduct
ad contributions of Prof. MOSKALEV of
USSR Academy of Sciences. His subject was
listed as "Uptake and Retention of
Plutonium in Man"; no abstract was
presented. When he spoke he changed the
title to "Problems of Kenetics of Uptake
and Retention of Radioisotopes." His
paper presented nothing new and can be
described as elementary. He apparently
spoke no English.

Information from another source on the
above conference. Dr. D. J. SEMENOV and
Dr. I.T. TRUGUBENKO ? were invited to
attend. The Soviets sent instead, Prof.
MOSKALEV. He was bright, but not

Re Symposium in Vienna, Austria from
26-31 August 63. The Soviets sant a small
three or four member delegation headed by
MOSKALEV "a very personable and diplomatic
gentleman." At the end of the conference
MOSKALEV voiced his dismay that the
Soviets had misunderstood the exact point
of the meeting and had presented very
minor papers.

Symposium on Radiological Health and
Safety in Nuclear Materials Mining &
Milling, Vienna, Austria late Aug 63.
"Due to misunderstanding in USSR, topics
covered by symposium were not known
sufficiently in advance for Soviet
scientists to contribute papers on other
than nuclear toxicology." All papers
were given by Dr. L. N. BURYKINA in

IAEA Symposium on Neutron Irradiation,

MOSKALEV, one of the Soviet delegates
was frequent commentator on other people's
work and made a practice of denigrating
their reports with respect to radiation
lethality.
Sources (3 U.S. scientists) were asked
if they thought MOSKALEV's objectives
were motivated from anything more than
genuine scientific position. They
responded - "Who can say?" MOSKALEV,
both from papers he gave and his questions
and comments in discussion, indicated he
was very sharp The paper he gave
presented no new data. His paper said
nothing specific.
ООВ 321,15482-66
About one third of the Soviets expected
at the Third Int'l Congress of Radiation
Research put in appearance. The papers
were disappointing. A paper written by
MOSKALEV and V.A. STRELTSOVA was not
impressive.

two days early. He had furnished no brief

OOB 321,27474-67
MOSKALEV participated in Second Int'l
Symposium on Delayed Effects of Bone
Seeking Radio Nuclides, Sun Valley,
Idaho, arriving two days early. He
had travelled alone to Sun Valley and
apparently was able to use his knowledge
of English language to get along on his
own. However, he complained to Chairman
of conference that he did not know enough
English to read his paper which also
required condensation because it was too
long for the time allowed. A colleague
who had known MOSKALEV from previous meet-
ings said MOSKALEV's knowledge of English
improved greatly after a few drinks.
However, he did not drink at all during
this conference. He did mention that he
had written the English version of the
paper he presented himself. A respected
U.S. scientisi with nore experience
than MOSKALEV said he frankly did not
believe MOSKALEV's findings. (Said this
in private.) MOSKALEV attempted to
make propaganda of a report by a West
German. MOSKALEV left the conference a
little upset. He took copious notes on
all papers, which indicated he understood
what was going on. He also took many
pictures with a 35 mm camera. From questions
he asked in private, it was obvious he
understood English quite well. Considerable
time was spent in arranging visit to a U.S.
lab. in route to his home. He took a
different route, without telling anyone
of plans, and did not visit the Tab

MOSKALEV was among Soviet delegation to

MOSKALEV personally attended virtually
every session and was very busy asking
many questions. He asked all questions
through an interpreter, but when answers
were given, in English, he always seemed
to understand without benefit of his
interpreter.

SUBJECT:
Possible Identity of the "Unidentified Man"
Photographed in Mexico City in October 1963
REFERENCES: A. Photos Taken in Mexico City by Mexico City
B.
Station
Paperback Boob "Appointment in Dallas"
C. Soft File, Headquarters Information on
Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV, Possible
"Unidentified Man"
1. Photographs of the unidentified man were taken by
our Mexico City Station on 2,3,4, and 15 October 1963, going
into or coming out of both the Cuban and Soviet Embassies in
Mexico City. Copies were provided to the FBI in Dallas,
Texas on 22 November 1963. Although cropped copies have
appeared in various works, including Volume XX, page 691, of
the Warren Commission Report, and the book "Appointment in
Dallas", to our knowledge the individual has never beeni
identified.
2. On 17 March 1977, a former member of the Cuban General
Directorate of Intelligence (DGI) recognized photographs of
the unidentifid man as Yuri LNU, a KGB officer, whom he met
in Moscow in 1964 while attending an intelligence course
there. He said that Yuri, a fluent English and Spanish
speaker, was acting as a trouble shooter for the Cuban group,
about 15, attending the course. Yuri lived with
14-00000
2
the Cuban and Bulgarian groups quartered in the same building
in Moscow.
Any time the Cubans had a problem, Yuri would solve
it for them.
Yuri was a good friend of Juan (pseudo) a KGB
officer who taught the Cubans about the Agency (CIA) and the
West German intelligence apparatus. Juan told the DGI member
that he had served in Mexico for about 20 years and in the U.S.
clandestinely for about 10 years (specific dates unknown). Yuri
was entrusted with their welfare only, and did not attend classes
with the Cuban group.
3. SE/X travel records were reviewed in search of an
individual by the name of Yuri who possibly fit the description
of the unidentified man. This lead to an individual by the
name of Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV, a Soviet, reportedly a Doctor
of Medical Sciences, who has participated in international
scientific conferences for the USSR since 1962 or earlier.
Although there is no official 201 file on MOSKALEV, there is a
sizable dossier on him in the Central Reference Service.
Many
of the documents in his dossier are 00 reports from U.S.
scientists concerning MOSKALEV's attendance and behavior at
scientific meetings. It is obvious that he has a much greater
knowledge of the English language than he admits.
His capability
is said to improve greatly after a few drinks; however, it is
noted that he rarely, if ever, drank at the scientific meetings.
It is also noted that on
occasions he reportedly was not
qualified to represent the Soviets at a particular conference.
His papers rarely, if ever, were specific, or presented new data.

Following are items of interest from selected documents in
MOSKALEV's CRS dossier:
a. In 1961 PENKOVSKY identified a photo (with no
name provided) as that of Col. Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEVSKIY,
Air Force Col.and GRU officer in the Information Directorate
of the GRU.
b. In
In December 1963 the FBI reported
c. In October 1963 MOSKALEV was a delegate to the
IAEA Symposium on Neutron Irradiation, Brookhaven, Long Island,
New York. Described by U.S. scientists as very sharp, MOSKALEV
was a frequent commentator on other people's work and made
a practice of denigrating their reports with respect to
radiation lethality.
d. In October 1967 MOSKALEV participated in the Second
International Symposium on Delayed Effects of Bone Seeking Radio
Nuclides, Sun Valley, Idaho, arriving two days early. He

was able to use
his knowledge of the English language to get along on his own.
Although he complained about not nowing much English, he
admitted writing the English version of the paper he presented.
MOSKALEV attempted to make propaganda of a paper by a West
German scientist. A respected U.S. scientist said he fran-ly
did not believe MOSKALEV's findings. MOSKALEV took copious
notes on all papers, which indicated he understood what was
going on. He also took many pictures with a 35 mm camera.
From questions MOSKALEV asked, it was obvious that he new
English quite well1. Although considerable time was spent
arranging for MOSKALEV to visit a U.S. laboratory en route to
his home, he took a different route,
without telling anyone
FBI
of his plans, and did not visit the lat.

4. On 23 March 1977 several identification experts of
the Disguise and Identification Section of OTS/GAD compared
photos of the unidentified man with photos of M Yuriy
Ivanovich MOSKALEV from the FBI, British Liaison, and CRS.
It was their opinion that MOSKALEV could very likely be
identifiable with the unidentified man.
5. Page 59 of the book "Appointment in Dallas," shows an
Identi-Kit Model composite of an individual who told the
author in London in 1972 that he was involved in the assassination
of President Kennedy. The composite of that individual (code
name "Saul"), whose real name is unknown to the author, bears
a striking resemblance to the photos of Yuriy Ivanovich
MOSKALEV. According to the author "Saul"identified the
picture shown in the Warren Commission Exhibit #237 as
having been taken at the Russian Embassy in Mexico City,
either in the foyer or just outside.

The author of the aforementioned book, Hugh C. McDonald,
is the inventor of the Identi-Kit and at one time was under
contract to CIA in regard to the Identi-Kit.
McDonald claims
in his book that he met "Saul" at an office in CIA Headquarters
sometime after the Bay of Pigs invasion, and that a colleague
of McDonald told him that "Saul" was an assassin.

There are striking parallels between the backgrounds
of "Saul" as given in McDonald's book, and MOSKALEV. For example:
