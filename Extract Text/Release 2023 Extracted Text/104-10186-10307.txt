1. The following information was received on
May 1, 1964 by a representative of this Agency from a
source in the Cuban intelligence service up to April 1964.
The information which he has provided to date has proved
to be reliable:
A.
is the "director de
politica regional de Europa Occidental" in the Cuban
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a post to which he was
rather recently named. Prior to being named to this
post, MONTENEGRO obtained 411 Cuban passports issued
in false names for the Direccion General de
Inteligencia (DGI - General Directorate of Intelligence)
agents and guerrilla warfare trainees. It is possible
that he will continue to handle the furnishing of
such passports in his new post.
B. MONTENEGRO knows all the DGI personnel and
frequently visits the chief of the DGI, Manuel VILLARO,
who probably is a DGI officer assigned to the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs; but, if not, he is at least
completely witting of DGI operations.
C. MONTENEGRO is a cousin of Ramon VAZQUEZ
Montenegro.
2. The records of this Agency reveal that in a document
dated 28 April 1960 there was included a list of persons who
were aboard the fishing vessel HATARI when it landed near
Vanny, Playa Colorado, San Blas Territory, Panama, on
25 April 1959. One Rogelio MONTENEGRO, possibly identical
with MONTENEGRO above, was one of the persons included on
SECRET
the list. The source of this information is not known; however,
newspaper accounts have substantiated the information.
3. Rogelio MONTENEGRO Guest, presumably identical with
Rogelio MONTENEGRO Gaspar, a Cuban diplomat, arrived
in Santiago, Chile, on February 1964 from Mexico; he carried
diplomatic passport E1/100. This information was received on
3 March 1964 by a representative of this Agency from an
official liaison service.
4. In a Bureau report dated 19 October 1952, New York,
New York, the name Rogelio MONTENEGRO Gudap, Cuban Counselor,
was mentioned as an individual intending to apply for travel
to the United States on 28 or 29 October 1952. This Agency
would appreciate receiving pertinent additional information
the Bureau may have on MONTENEGRO.
