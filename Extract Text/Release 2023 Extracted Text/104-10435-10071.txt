September 1944
After emerging briefly from hiding in September 1944, DIMITROV again went
underground engaging in anti-Communist activities, touring various towns
and cities (including sections of Yugoslavia and Macedonia) and urging
members of the Agrarian Party to take positive action against the Commu
nists

DIMITROV claimed he began underground anti-Fascist activities in 1943 in
Macedonia and to have worked closely with Dr. George M. DIMITROV (who
headed the left-wing of the Agrarian Party known as Pladne) during this
time.

The Bulgarians at Lavrion Camp established a new political organization
known as the "P. D. Petkov Organization". The member, who are listed
in the protocol (attached to the report), have deserted the Bulgarian
Agrarian Party in an effort to retain their "pure" agrarian character.
In the opinion of the Petkov Organization, the Agragrian Party has been
penetrated by the leftists. Protocol signed on 30 April 1950.
DIMITROV's name appears as a member of the Board of Control.

OCTOBER 1950
Early in October 1950, DIMITROV visited the Lavrion Camp where he met
with a number of his Bulgarian friends and advised them that he had been
given a "charter and instructions", by certain members of
to form a committee of five members for the planning and execu-
tion of a fight for the liberation of Bulgaria. This committee, according
to DIMITROV, would be established in Athens and would cooperate with other
similar committees which have already been formed in France, Germany, and
other countries. The committee would later expand to 20 members and would
establish a so-called "Democratic Agrarian Bloc".
Recruits would come from
among the members and sympathizers of the Bulgarian Democratic Party
(Moushynov) and from the Gichev Agrarians. Eligible Bulgarian emigres
would come to Greece from Western Europe to assist in the work, and pro-
13 00000
minent members of the Gichev Agrarians and of the Democratic Party would
be assisted in escaping to Greece (presumably from Bulgaria) to join the
organization.
DIMITROV listed the organization's tasks as follows:
a.
b.
c.
Intelligence activity in Bulgaria.
Organization of an underground resistance
movement in Bulgaria, and
Organization of sabotage activity against
Bulgaria.
DIMITROV revealed that he was the president of the organization.

DIMITROV again visited the Lavrion Camp to inform his recruitsthat they
would shortly be moved to a pleasant hime in Athens which the Americans
were repainting for the purpose. On the occasion of this visit, the re-
cruits were divided into three groups, as follows:
a.
b.
c.
a groupd of 10 men to specialize in intelligence;
a group of 6 men to be trained in radio in Germany
a group of 15 men to specialize in sabotage.
The source of the information contained in the SODB 31992 described
DIMITROV as"an unprincipaled opportunist and Greek agent".
SODB 31992, 14.12.50
During this period of time, DIMITROV was the principal agent
in an ill-fated operation which resulted in a major expose and
trial in Sofia during 1951. The agents used were those selec-
ted by DIMITROV, at least one of whom was poto probably an
operative of the Bulgarian Militia and acted as the betrayer
of his colleagues.

He is the subject of a five volume

studied philology for one year at Sofia University from 1942-43.

after the war; he was soon disillusioned by the Communists and

towns urging agrarianss to take positive action against communica.
Finally captured in Sofia, he stated that his life was spared
because he was groomed as a witness against PETKOV. He escaped
to Greece in 1947 and subsequently worked for the Greeks doing
occasional propaganda under a shortened version of his true first

never participated in the actual cross-border operations. In
early 1951, various operation operational and administrative difficulties
began to manifest themselves and it was decided that KELLY should
be removed from his position. In April 1951 it came to OPC's
attention that KELLY intended to sell his operational knowledge
to the French Intelligence Servico. This fact was used as the
primary reason for his removal fron active participation in
4. Because of operational security considerations steuning
from KELLY's duplicity and personal make-up, it was deened in-
advisable to leave him at large in Greece. It was decided to
transfer bin to a holding facility in the Vestern Hemisphere.
He was airlifted from Athens to Frankfurt where he was hospital-
ized four days for observation, and then flown to the holding
facility, arriving on 4 September 1951. He remained there until
January 1954 when at that time it was determined whatever opera-
tional knowledge he had was obsolete.
5. After unsuccessful efforts to resettle KELLY in 'Brazil,
he was temporarily removed from the holding area to Syros, Greece.
A commitment was made to the Greek authorities that RVROCK ould
not abandon him in Greece and would take steps to have him
resettled in one year. Efforts vere made to effect KELLY
nigration to Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and elsewhere, but
to no avail. After due consideration by the authorities
concerned, it was decided that the best effective solution
would be to let hin immigrate to the United States on his ow
under the Refugee Relief Act progran.
6. Since entering the United States, KELLY has been a
continual source of embarrassment. Megiomania is evident in his
various communications with U.S. government agencies. Over the
years he has written lengthy letters to the Director, Secretary
of State, USIA, Vice President Nizon, President Kennedy, etc.
A typical example of this correspondence was his letter to the
Vice President requesting an appointment as Mr. Nizon's anti-
communist advisor, or the statement in his letter to President
Kennedy that he could liberate the Balkan countries from Communism
in five years if he were allowed to work actively with financial
support. Our first knowledge that KELLY was representing himself
as a film producer vas a 14 May 1957 notice from the Department of
State advising that KELLY was trying to interest then in purchasing
a feature length film script.
7. The last correspondence from Athens on KELLY is contained
in NKAA-990 of 26 April 1968, written by Philip L. BACHNAN (P).
On this occasion KELLY appeared at the American Embassy in Athens
asking to talk to the First Secretary. He identified himself as
leader of "The Bulgarian Liberation Underground Movement Against
Communisa." The Station at this time reported no traces, but added
a comment that he probably vas identical with Subject of 201-045145.
However, the Station evidently has no record of his pseudo or his

which generated the latest inquiry from the field. At one time
during his sojourn in the holding area mentioned above, KELLY con-
fided that his marriage vas recognized by both parties as one of
convenience. He claimed that be and his former wife agreed to

explanation of how this was supposed to work. However, their well
laid plans were wrecked by the arrival of a baby daughter while
they were in Rome, Italy on their first step toward innigration.
According to KELLY, this event forced their return to Athens where
he eventually got involved in Bulgarian operations. He declared
that had their plans worked out, he and his former wife had
agreed to part company once they were safely ensconced in
the United States.
9. Ve feel this account should be on record at the
Station because judging from the past performance the infamous
Lyle 0. KELLY (P) probably will come to our attention again.
Ve can provide more detailed information on EFELLY's operational
history if required.

1. Subject is Dimitrios #*DIMITRÓF aka General Dico DIMITROV;
DPOB: 24 May 24 in Bulgaria; Citizenship: Unknown; Occupations
Movie film producer; Address: c/o Marjorie DARE, 360 West 22nd Street
New York, New York; Miscellaneous: Claims to have worked for WOFIRM.
2. Subject came to Station attention as a result of a pre
marital investigation which was being conducted by LNEASE on
Kalliopi Stylianou GERALEXIS; aka "Poppy", Mrs. Dimitrios DIMITROF,
born 18 August 1941 in Athens, Greece who was married to Subject in
a civil ceremony in Italy on 4 July 1962. The marriage was not
recognized by Greek law. Under separate cover is a copy of the
LNEASE memo which outlines Subject's allegations regarding
collaboration with WOFIRM.
3. The marital investigation turned up the following traces
from the Liaison Section of the American Embassy in Madrid, Spain:
"This office has information on a Diko DIMITROFF, who may be
identical with Subjeet's (GERALEXIS') former husband. A source
of unknown reliability reported in 1965 that Diko DIMITROFF had
connections with the Bulgarian Intelligence Service and with a
dissident group in Bulgaria. DIMITROFF represents himself as a
film producer".
4. The only remotely identifiable traces at Athens Station
are on a Dimitri DIMITROV aka Dimitur Adamov DIMITROV, DOB circa
1920, who was a member of the Bulgarian Agrarian Party and a student
who fled to Greece in 1946. (Source: PGA-4769 of 8 March 1950,
file 33-5-2). He was 'in contact with the A.D. at that time and
reported that he had an order to go to Washington for a time. The
above is carded info only with a caption: "French I.S.".
5. Subject also has travelled to Italy, France, England, and
Switzerland in connection with the movie industry, but we defer to
Headquarters regarding possible notification of other field stations
until after they have conducted traces. In the meantime we have
informed LNEASE/Athens that Subject has no connection with WOFIRM
