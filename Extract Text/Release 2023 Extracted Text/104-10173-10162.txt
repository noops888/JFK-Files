MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: "American Defectors to the USSR
1. The attached material was part of a soft file entitled
"American Defectors to the USSR", which was set up by SR/6
(Support) around 1960 and maintained by various SR components
until ca. 1963. The compilations were derived from a variety
of sources, and contain both classified and overt data....
2. In the fall of 1966, the files were turned over to CI
Staff. In most instances, basic information was then abstracted
for the US Defector Machine Program, am. In all instances in which
the material was unique, or represented a valuable collation effort,
it has been incorporated into the appropriate 201 file, along with
a copy of this memorandum.
3. It is suggested that any dissemination of this data should
be coordinated with SB Division and with CI Staff (CI/MRO),- in
view of the frequently inadequate sourcing and of the fact that
disseminations have have already been made through the US Defector
Machine Program.

Why do CP press and the Congress plug Douglas for President? Why is a letter

Mumford, who now opposes Communism though he was once a backer and leader of
CP fronts including at least one that opinly proclaimed its Communist revolutionary
arms?
