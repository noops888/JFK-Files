And I think again we have some doubts as to the accuracy of
his reporting.
Mr. Schwarz.
In November 1961 did Mr. Bissell indstruct

a William Harvey to take charge of the gambling syndicate

operation designed to kill Fidel Castro? Page 3 of Mr. Greer's
report, which is at the beginning of your report.
Mr. Colby. I believe so, yes.
11
Yes. That is what our evidence says, the summary
12
13
14
sais, "of the evidence available". And this is the evidence
available in 1963. And there have been some minor changes in
some of the details of this summary, very minor changes.
15
But the essence of this report is still roughly accurate, I
16
believe.
17
Mr. Schwarz.
Mr. Harvey was Mr. Harvey the man that
18
had hired an agent in order to kill Lmumba?

Mr. Colby. Mr. Harvey was the head of Staff D, Staff D
of the Operations directorate was responsible for communica
tions intelligence work on the secret level. A substantial
portion of this staff's work involves attempts to penetrate
embassies particularly abroad-on totally abroad, broad, I don't
think they have ever done one here, in order to get at their

codes and ciphers, and in the process, you obviously work up
2
some people who are able to do this kind of work, which is
3 quite different from the normal life style of most of us.
4
Mr. Harvey had been a very venturesome officer in the
5

past. He was responsible for the Berlin tunnel. And he was
sent down to take this job. And he assumed as part of it the
capability of he was given by Mr. Bissel this chore of

carrying on this particular operation as well.
Had he been the person who had, in
connection with the abortive effort to kill Mr. Lmumba,
hired an agent for that purpose?
1(B)
Mr. Colby. I have forgotten whether hehired him. He
hired a foreigner. And this foreigner's job - our records
indicate that this foreigner's job was tied up with tled up with the pener
[tration of code rooms and the safe cracking and thing stof this
nature for that purpose. And there are some very obscure
references that an additional assignment was to look into the
possible assassination of Mr. Lmumba.
The evidence is
18
19
that he went down to what is now Kinshasa, Elizabethville in
1960, stayed there a few weeks, and left in October, I
20
21
believe. And then Mr. Lmumba was killed thereafter in a totally
separate set of circumstances in which we had nothing to do.
22
There is some indication that a CIA officer who was asked
23
24
to have something to do with this particular job said he did
not want to do it.

Mr. Colby. To my knowledge it is Mr. Raymond Rocca.
Chairman Church.
Where is it now?
Mr. Colby. He retired at the end of December of last year.
He remained working for us for a few months. I think he is
retired. I think he is retired. I believe he is still in
the Washington area.
Mr. Knoche. Yes, he is still working with us.
Mr. Colby. Still working with us to help on the transi-
tion of the whole counter intelligence program.
Chairman Church. Why did he retire?
Mr. Colby. That was the Angleton case, Mr. Chairman, and
the facts of that case were that I had had some professional
differences in the organization with Mr. Angleton as to the
way the counterintelligence business was run and the way the
the way the 1(b)
Haccount was handled. I believed that it required a
higher degree of coordination of the other elements of the
Directorate and of the Agency. We had debated this on various
occasions in the past. I did reorganize that staff in 1973 and
took a number of functions away from it. The liaison with the

FBI for instance, and a couple of other things. Ingradually
endeavored to open up the
account to a better gelation-
Iship with our otier Year Fastern activities. We debated this
over many months and on several occasions. We could never
really agree to it because he insisted on the importance of
retaining it where it was.
Mr Angleton had done a very good job of establishing that
liaison years ago and knew a lot of the senior
were involved in it.
I believed there was inadequate coordination in the Asale
wher
areas.
1(b)
Also, I believed that there was a undue degree of compart-
mentation of that staff, that it needed more interchange with
our other divisions.
We debated this and discussed it and I
set as my time limit for this discussion the end of December
because there were some very substantial retirement benefits
that people would loose if they stayed after that point. Then
unfortunately the Seymour Hirsh article of December 22nd came
to our attention before it was actually published, and so I
brought Mr. Angleton up and said that I was going to make two
basic decisions. I was going to move the
account from
his control and I was going to put some sucessor leadership
into the Head of the Counterintelligence Staff.
Ib
I said I would
offer him a post of tying together some counterintelligence
doctrine, he could stay working with us.
He did not have to

and frankly heard about it after it occurred.

In the fall of 1956, a senior Chinese Nationalist official
informed an officer of CIA that a Chinese National planned to
assassinate Chou En Lai during his visit to Cambodia in
8
9
10
November '56 and had been thwarted by the Cambodian arrest of
the Chinese Nationalist officer sent to Phnom Penh to supervise
the attempt. We learned of this after it had happened and we
had nothing to do with it.
11
We had a relationship with the
12
13
14

16
over the years and they clearly have done
things without our knowledge or involvement, and in a number,
of areas, but we have also worked together on Some areas.
These are two that were separate.
Alsc I was asked to look at the photographs of Howard Hunt

individuals in it.
Senator Schweiker. Did you get the other photograph, the

Mr. Colby. I don't have that with me. It is in the

Chairman Church. Just one thing I would like to say to

14
15
16
17
you, Mr. Colby, before I forget it. You have made reference
to the
account and the special way that it had been
handled under Mr. Angleton. Before we finish our review with
you of covert operations we would like to have a more detailed
statement of that matter
1(사)
Mr. Colby. Right.
18
Chairman Church.
And I think you should prepared to
19
20
discuss it with us and we will have further questions to ask
you in connection with it.
21
I just wanted to give you notice.
22
Mr. Colby. Right. In our lexicon it doesn't count as a
23
covert action but that is all right, no problem, I will cover
24
it.

them.
Mr. Harvey was given the responsibility of this by Mr.
Bissel and originally it continued as a separate action from
the Castro operation, but Mr. Harvey was also given that
responsibility, and for all intents and purposes they became
wedded.
Mr. Helms was the person who formally approved ZR Rifle
as a project. ZR Rifle had a dual purpose that has not been
clarified by our inquiry. It apparently was in fact used for
the stated purposes, as far as organizational activities want
along, which was to steal codes, and Mr. Helms, when he
approved the project, authorized accounting on certification,
which meant that rather than the usual vouchers supporting
expenditures, that the officer involved would simply certify
that the money had been spent and this would be accepted.
It had a project amount of some dollars, $7500 - $10,000.
some of it to include the salary of an agent, some to include
operating expenses.
So Mr. Helms' main appearance in the approval of ZR Rifle
does not necessarily equate with the date when he became
familiar with the Castro operation.
Mr. Schwarz. Because of the dual purpose of Rifle, Rifle
means both, rifle files and used rifles?
Mr. Breckinridge. It may mean either or both.

Mr. Schwarz.

Mr. Breckinridge.
I think that is probably correct.
It

of the dates, So Mr. Bissel would have known at that time.
But I am not sure after that.
Chairman Church. Helms succeeded Mr. Bissel as chief
of operations?
Mr. Colby. Deputy Director of Plans.
Chairman Church. Deputy Director for Plans.
Your record shows that Helms had knowledge of the ZR Rifle
12
13
operation, which, among other things, was to develop an executive
capability whatever that means.
Presumably that means a
14
capability to conduct an assassination if and when authorized
15
by proper authority?
16
Mr. Breckinridge.
That is my understanding.
17
18
Chairman Church. Is that your understanding?
Mr. Breckinridge. Yes, sir.
19
Chairman Church. Do your records show that, or is that
20
based upon what has been revealed through your interrogation?

Mr. Breckinridge. First, let me go back and clarify, then
I will answer this question, if I may.

responsibility of stealing codes, essentially?
Mr. Helms approved ZR Rifle, which the secord showshaarthe

25
My understanding, from my interviews, is that ZR Rifle had

Chairman Church. Senator Hart.
Senator Hart of Colorado. Mr. Colby, in connection with
ZR Rifle, I think you testified or your associate said this was
a multi-purpose operation, including stealing codes, and the
development of the capability of what euphemistically is called
executive action.
In your professional judgment, and with your history of
your background in the Agency, does it make any sense to you that
a major operation, a major intelligence gathering operation of
the sort of stealing codes, which. I assume means from other (5)
governments would be mounted under the direction of a man
about whom all I know is that Mr. Harvey has a background of
something like a soldier of fortune, and funded at the level,
I should say, of $7500 to $10,000?
Does it not suggest to you thate stealing codes was in
1/3)
fact an internal cover for what was explicitly an assassination
operation with unlimited, non-voucher financial capability?
Mr. Colby. No, not that it is purely a cover.
In the first place, Mr. Harvey had a very successful tour
in Berlin where he ran the Berlin tunnel operation, which was
one of our major successful intelligence operations.
Mr. Harvey was a very colorful figure who had his lifestyle,
which is different than some others, but he had been very
effective at that, and vory adventuresome in that category 01 1
signals intelligence and a very venturesome idea of that nature.
NW 50955 DocId: 32203792 Page 12
91
He was in the assignment of Chief of the FI Division staff.
That Staff's major fumotion is to conduct the signals intelligence
ich must be done in the clandestine service. work which must
1(B)
It handles our efforts today to penetrate into foreigr
code rooms abroad, and things of that nature, and it involves
1(B)
the breaking into of safes and things, all that complicated
material?
Now, the thing that puts it together with this "capability"
executive action, is the high degree of compartmentation of
this material, that kind of a project. In other words, a
code-breaking, a stealing operation, obviously that is to be
kept very, very secret. If you get caught in it, it has all
sorts of very bad diplomatic implications, and so forth.
1(B)
Therefore, there is a system of very sharp compartmentation of
the work of that particular group.
You also are dealing with some very venturesome people
who are willing to crawl into somebody else's code room and 18
take the chance of getting caught
So, given you have a man who had some good technical
experience, who is a venturesome type himself and is running a
program which is not too far off the requirements of high
compartmentation, and a very high risk kind of operation, and
therefore, for ir. Bissel to have selected Harvey to carry out
this project seems to me that it is compatible that he could
be running code-breaking projects, or code stealing proj, res
NW 50955 DocId:32203792 Page 13
92
as well as this other activity.
Now, in the lifestyle at the time, not mentioning the second
one, this gets back into the recordkeeping that we have been
discussing.
It was not to be put on the record although to be
done. That is a perfectly proper hypothesis, it seems to me,
but to say that the code stealing was only a cover I think is 1
13
B
probably an unwarranted conclusion.
Senator Hart of Colorado. What about the level of funding
of $7,500 to $10,000?
Mr. Colby. That is not very much money for that kind of
an operation.
Senator Hart of Colorado. Precisely. I think it is too
little.
Mr. Colby. No. For a capability of that nature, it is
largely a staff operation.
In other words, you use your own
staff officers. You may hire an agent or something, but I don't
think you can draw much conclusion from the actual number on
the figure one way or the other.
This might not have been the only such project. You know,
an assassination project would cost you more money than that,
too.
Senator Hart of Colorado. Absolutely.
Mr. Colby. I find it hard to say that that is the only
amount of money involved. I think you get into a situation
where additional money would be put into either of those kinds

Chairman Church.
Before you do, would you just explain
exactly what the relationship between CIA and Giancana and
Maheu was because that is not clear in my mind.
Would you develop for the Committee that whole relationship?
Mr. Breckinridge. Robert Maheu used to work for the
FBI and he resigned from the FBI and opened a private investiga-
tive firm here in Washington and CIA used him from time to
time for certain kinds of support activities.
Chairman Church. What kind of support activities?
Mr. Breckinridge. On one occasion he obtained a female
companion for an important foreiga leader.
1(B)
Chairman Church.
What other kind of support?
Mr. Breckinridge.
In the early days and this becomes
an embarrassment.
As nearly as I can reconstruct, the people
who knew him decided to put him on a retainer in the Office
of Security, which they did for awhile, until he was so
successful he said he no longer needed the retainer, which he
didn't do much to earn. He later got involved representing
one of the Greek shipping interests and we were given the
results of some of the information that he obtained from that
where there was a fight between Niarchos and Onassis.
We
think he may have had some involvement in another
leader's companionship when he was in this country. I don't
have the details. I think we can probably reconstruct it for
you.

Mr. Schwarz.
I would like to pick up on the discussion
we had.
Chairman Church. Mr. Schwarz has five minutes more, and
we will conclude, and I would like to ask the Committee to stay
on for ten more minutes for an executive session.
Mr. Schwarz. In the discussion we had on the use of
criminal elements, we have dealt with the Castro operation.
In the middle of the book supplied to us by Mr. Breckinridge
earlier this week, there is a discussion about the Lumumba
operation, and the Agent Q. J. Win.
Now, is it a fact that Q. J. Win was the agent, or asset,
however you would refer to him, who apparently was considered
for the effort to assassinate Lumumba, which never took place;
is that right?
Mr. Colby. Yes, sir.
Mr. Schwarz. Now, is it accurate that Q. J. Win operated
in Europe trying to spot and assess individuals whom the Agency
could use in safecracking operations?
1(B)
Mr. Colby. This is what is reported, and it is quite
possible.
Mr. Breckinridge.
The record indicates that.
Mr. Schwarz. And is it further so that one of the CIA
officers who first met Q. J. Winin Luxembourg, was on a
trip overseas to find safecrackers and document suppliers?
1(B)
Mr. Colby. Yes, that is what it says.
