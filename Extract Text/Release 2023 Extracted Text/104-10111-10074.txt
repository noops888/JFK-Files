the Reporter Dispatch, an Eastchester County Newspaper,06
contacted him and asked him about CARSWELL and (BARRY) advised
him that CARSWELL maintained transient residence at his

very infrequently. The reporter inquired whether or not ol
CARSWELL was an electrical technician or engineer and (BARRY
replied in the negative and stated that CARSWELL was a
management consultant, he believed, for the engineering firm.

the reporter, believed (BARRY) and CARSWELL first met while
civilian employees with the U.S. Air Force several years
previously.
3. The reporter related that his paper obtained the
lead on CARSWELL through their contact in Havana who received
information regarding CARSWELL from the Cuban News Service,
which information indicated CARSWELL's Eastchester address.
