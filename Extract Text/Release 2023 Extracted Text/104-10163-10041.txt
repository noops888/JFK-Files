MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
BUBJECT: Telephone Conversation between AMBIDDY-1 and
Martin Ferrer
DATE : 30 June at 1100 hours
1. Upon Erneido Oliva's request, AMBIDDY-1 went to
meet with him last night. At the meeting Oliva mentioned
to A-1 that he (Oliva) was receiving the backing of KUBARK
and the Pentagon and implied A-l was also receiving aid.
Oliva stated that he has met with Alfredo Rodemeyer, the same
Rodemeyer that both of them had met early last year. A-1
replied this was all before the death of Kennedy and he
no longer had contact with any of ODYOKE's officials.
According to Oliva, Mr. Rodemeyer spoke badly of some of the
personnel in A-l's organization, e.g., Antonio Iglesias, i
Oliva mentioned that he had talked with Thomas Mann
recently and expected to seu Mr. Mann within the coming week
to receive support for his conventional warfare program.
A-1 told Oliva he had no objection to the conventional
warfare plan and that he would morally support Oliva in
liberating Cuba. However, he would continue in his own
little way with his unconventional war. According to A-1,
he made it clear to Oliva that he was not receiving ODYOKE
backing.
2. A-1 expects to leave on 1 July for Costa Pica
tomorrow. He again mentioned that Adelaide will soon be
leaving the United States. A-1 commented he does not expect
to visit the United States as often as he has done in the
past. A-1 asked that Enrique and Mr. Archer clearly under-
stand that he does intend to keep his word concerning the
changes he has mentioned to us at the last two meetings.

ANNORLD'S MEETING IN NEW ORLEANS, 24 June 1964
SUBJECT: ANBIDDY-1's Image and Philosophy
1. ANBIDDY-1's preoccupation with his political image
shene thru, shen he inquired whether we suspected him of
dictatorial leanings. We replied, in effect, that we enter-
Rained such suspicions and inclined toward taking his proteste-
tions of liberalion and laisses faire with a heavy dose of
salt. Once in power, he would treat the 1940 as a scrap of
paper and run the country along autoritorian lines. Flattered
by his implied inclusion in the line of succession, A-l only
voiced mild dissent.
2. Comments Considering the exigencies of autemony
which dany us much opportunity, let alone leverage in shaping
ANGIDOT-1's political philosophy, we have conveyed to him to a
variety of ways that we do not particularly care one way or
the other, that we do not fancy him as a chosen instrument outside
the periphery of AORLD and that by extension - we have no
intention of promoting any political aspirations he may barbor.
We have also left no doubt in his mind that we view his per-
fernance in the ANWORLD driver's seat rather than any philose-
phical streams of consciousness, as a dupendable gauge of how
he would be performing in a position of political responsibility.
Vo pointed out to ANTIDDY-1 that Liberation Day would
find a prestrats, bankrupt and exhausted people, weary to death
ef politics and propaganda, exaving to be left alons for a stále
te eelises its thoughts. There would be ne political infra-
structure on which to build and promaturely called general elections
'vould merely serve to deluce the currency of parliamentary dome
eracy even more. For a voile at least, a benign and just exscutibil
vould have to restora Cuba's equilibriua and permit her te rebuild
the feat ratione without which a descracy commot properly function.

In this contaxt, we mentioned sentiments expressed by AMBIDDY-1

construction pilase and voiced hope that he would do his share to
see these noble ideas put inte effest.

AMWORLD MEETING IN NEW ORLEANS, 24 June 1964
SUBJECT: Adlaida PADRON y Crus - Decision to Nove Her to
Nicaragua
1. Drawing liberally upon data supplied in UPGA 16512,
ve reminded AMBIDDY-1 about our misgivings regarding his
association with Adelaida PADRON y Cruz. He conceded aware-
hess of some of the rumors circulating about her past private
life and stated that be had satisfied himself that they were
unfounded. We injected that we knew that Jose Mole Rosales
has been asked to do some investigating and had given Adelaida
Padron a clean bill of health. We also happened to know that
KXI was aware of the true story and for reasons of his own
had decided to withhold it from ANBIDDY-1. we inquired what
he knew about Senora MOLI and he commented that she had been
a "bad women". We observed that the "had been" vas open to
question.
2. AMBIDDY-1 averred that he had listened to a telephone
conversation betoon Adelaida and ber forser husband, Roger
Rejas Lavernis, in which the latter had adnitted that the story
about his having acted under higher orders when marrying
Adolatda vere unfounded. AKBIDDY-l also charged the ex-husband
of hoving tried to untice his wife to participate in ergies,
bus tant Adelaida hed refused to do so.
3. As regards Adelaida's alleged illicit relationship
with ex-President BATISTA, AMBIDDY-1 simply declared the charge
to be unfounded. Adelaida did kesy Carlos CANTILLO Gonzales
the wo an old fried of the family. She also had met ex-Presi-
dat Jums, but nothing of a compromising nature had ensued.
4. When Gebed whether te me tous thes Advlatda bad intro-
deod bia to several prominent Venezusians, he denied this and
stated that introdestions had been made by stivia GARCIA,
Brusted childhood friend of ANBIDDY-1.

5. Our query why Adelaida, if she had AMBIDDY-1's
interests at heart, appeared to have qualms about oming up
in respect to past events, was parried by AMBIDOY-1 by claiming
that Adelaida was of course aware of all these rumors and had
warned his of possible political embarrassment.
6. Evaluating UFGA 16512 on the basis of our talk with
AMBIDUY-1, we conclude that its main source has a high batting
average. At least there appears to be a hard core of truth to
practically all allegations made, to the extent we ware able
to check them out. We would venture the gross that, despite
his protestations to the contrary, AMBIDDY-1 is quite conversant
with Adelaida's past history, but can see no practical gain in
so telling us.
He may reason that an avowel of intent to marry
a woman whose antecedents are in fact as described, would seriously
blemish his image and that by pleading ignorance now he can, if
things should get out of control, always strike a pose of injured
Innocence and elicit a 'here but for the Grace of God ge I" re-
action from his PBPRIME associates.
7. Agreement that all interested parties would benefit by
zoving Adelaida's abode from the WAVE area to Bicaragua was
reached on the basis of ANBIDDY-1's acceptance of our flat state-
mant that we view Adelaida as a potential hazard to AMWORLD's and
KUMARK'a security. He based this reasoning upon numerous indt
ications that Adelaide had become all but completely privy to
everything that was going on in AMWORLD and that her discretion
Left a great deal to be desired. We drew no dental from ANBIDDY-1
shen stating that Adelaide had become witting of the WAVE training
course for AMBIDDY-1 and that she presumably knew about KITBARK
support for ANJORLD. We referred to Adelaida's lesbian associates,
without stating that we suspected her of holding charter nembership
in that cererity. He antioned by name Aida FEREZ and Lucia CANO.
When the latter was labelled by us a lesbian believed to be in
Adelaida's complute cmtidende, AMBIDDY-1 evinced surprise and
fer recsene difficult to fathom almost disaay, we concluded by
stressing the importance of breaking up adalatda's strale of
associates and confidants as an indispensable prerequisite for
containing the threat her access to informatica we consider
classified represents and asked ANBIDOT-1 te sake sure that no
member of this group would follow her to Kisaragua.

8. We made no attempt, which in any case would have been
vain, to break up the relationship between AMBIDDY-1 and
Adelaida. We apologized to him for involving ourselves in
matters of a private and intimate nature which unfortunately
være beginning to impinge upon ODYOKE security interests.
ANBIDOT-1 in turn made it clear that he thinks he is in love
and that separation is not in the cards. We dropped the
issue by assuring AMBIDDY-1 that the day would come when things
could be soon in better perspective and that he could depend on
*us not to gloat of rewind him that we had told him se.
9. We mentioned offhand that we assumed that Adelaida
had all the papers necessary to effect her departure fron
POPRIMR. AMBIDDY-1 replied that she had not been able yet to
get the necessary papers. We simply commented that she should
ask for then.

B. DIR 31528
:
1. Chief, WH requests that an investigation of the truth of
some of the allegations rade in Ref à report be held in abeyance
pending determination whether Subject in fact has decided to leave
PEPRIMS for Nicaragua.
2. Headquarters continues to be interested in additional data
regarding the house in the WAVE area which AMBIDDY-1 intends to
purchase in the name of Nilo Messer.
3. If it should turn out that the conditions described in
Ref report are not drastically remedied and continue to pose a
festering threat to the security of ANWORLD, your station may have
to be requested to investigate. In the meanwhile, we are hopeful
that Subject's removal from the WAVE area will serve to attenuate
this bad situation.
4. Thanks to def a report, we were able (without going into
too such sordid detail) to put AMBIDUY-1 on notice that we view his
association with Subject in the WAVE area as a potential threat to
ANWORLD' and EUBARK's security and that the political scandal
potential of the existing situation is equally formidable. We
consequently fell in with AMBIDDY-1's suggestion, made during the
latest reeting in Panama City, that he rove the center of his illicit
affair to Manngua where it would be easier to contain unpleasant
repercussions than in the WAVE area. We urged AMBIDDY-1, and he
promised to hood our advice, that ne dot permit subject to take
along to Ficaragua members of her present entourage, singling out
Identity O of Ref A as a particular cate in point.
5. It should be stressed that AMBIDDY-1 is unwavering in his
(real ar feigned) conviction that Subject is pure as driven snow and
badly maligned and that he has a ready explanation for every "rmor."
It would have been unvise to attempt coercing him into discontinuing
his affair with Subject, and most likely he would not have yielded to
any prekoures. Hence, we had no choice but to settle for the pro-
poved nove to Nicaragua which represents a palliative at best.

Debriefing of Russell H. Sambora in Wash., D.C. 16 June 1964
SUBJECT: DMJK Engineers
Banbora reported he met with AMBIDDY/1 at the Miami
airport on 5 June 1964 for a brief discussion of organi-
zational changes. After their talk, A/l requested Sambora
accompany him to the airport hotel to act as interpretor
with an American engineer (possibly DMJM). Sambora did
not recall the name of the engineer but that the engineer
had stated the airstrip in Nicaragua would cost somewhere
in the vicinity of a million dollars. According to
Sambors, A/1 simply listened to the proposal and said he
would take the matter under advisement.

ANFORLD Meeting in Miani, 28 June 1964
SUBJECT: Photographs of Adolaida Padron
1. During a lull in the meeting I took AMBIDDY-1
naide (as instructed) and told him it would be best
for all concerned to take Adelaida out of POPRINE as
ho had suggested. I mentioned to him there is a growing
number of reports en Adelaida finding their way to
Vashington, making it increasingly difficult for us to
protect his rear.
3. I then casually mentioned to him that we had
received come obscene photographs which have caused us
to do some fast talking with "some people in Washington"
that are beginning to have some sisgivings about
AMRIDOT-1 (actually this story is notional).
3. I noticed the remark concerning the photographs
uport ANBIDDY-1. "Do you mean immoral pictures, Kartin?"
AMRIDDY-1 inquired. I nodded and to avoid his asking
further questions about the pictures, I reminded him of
bio procice that Lucia Cano
(AMBIDDY-1
denied knowing her) and Aida Peres Pozo would not follow
Adelaida to Nicaragua.
4. Daring the rest of the meeting AMBIDDY-1 appeared
to be somewhat dejected and preoccupied. It is the opinion
of the Co's attending the meeting that this was attributed
to the rezarks made concerning the existence of these
photographs.
8. in the necting was about to end, AMBIDDY-1 asked
Dogen, "ומן מסע מפy have some seral pictures of
Kirting" Again I said "You." These
photographs had come into our possession plus much more
-

Bond, reding and

information that we had not divulged to him. AMBIDDY-1
then inquired if he could see the photographs. I replied
that it was our feeling that it would serve no useful
purpose other than to satisfy his own curiosity. Inasmuch
as he had promised to take Adelaide out of the country,
there was no sense in rubbing salt into the wound. Further
more, we did not wish to reveal our sources to AMBIDDY-1.
Lastly, both he and I know that photographs could be..
fabricated and we did not want to be falsely accused of
doing just this. AMBIDDY-1 again asked that I inform
BECKHOFF that he is interested in seeing the pictures.
In order to drop the entire subject, I promised AMBIDDY-1
I would pass the message to BECKHOFF.
6. BECKHOFF believes that this (notional) intervention
Jarred ANBIDDY-1 out of his complacent assumption that we
lack substantial information to back up our claim that
Adelaida's immoralities are more than unprovable rumors.
Also, hopefully, he may now have been put on guard and
say take adequate precautions against blackmail of himself
er Adelaida which we consider a major threat to the security
of ANWORLD. If in future meetings AMBIDDY-1 should revert
to the existence of these photographs, it may be best to
state that they were promptly destroyed but that their also
being in the possession of potential blackmailers can never
be ruled out. ANBIDDY-1 should be reminded of his assurance
to alert us immediately if such blackmail attempts are made
since he may need our help in varding them off. He has
our assurance that we would not use the cropping up of
such difficulties to remind him of his failure to heed our
varaings.

1. Without impugning AMBIDDY-1's right to purchase
a home ve advised him that many derogatery roports have
reached our ears concerning his purchase of a home and
for this reason only we wanted to sot the record straight
and thereby be in a better position to combat malicious
rumors, A-l said he understood and it was evident A-1
did not take it (the inquiry) as a personal affront.
During a break in the meeting A-1 wont home to obtain the
Recessary data on the house. Within a few hours A-1
returned with the information plus a blueprint of the
house.

nent on the house is $330. The funds for the downpayment

Adelaida contributed money she had received
fren an automobile accident ($1,000)..
6. The balance was borrowed from Sinto Mesa (81,800),
A- added that the money borrowed from Adelaida and
Nees was paid back to them. According to A-1 the house
is valued at $38.000, A-1 was asked why the houre WES
net registered in iis name, A-1 replied this was done
to prevent rumors from starting as to where he had gotten
the money. For this reason the house is regzoterod in
the name of Antonio Bana (A-1's bodyguard). As soon as
Adelaida departs for Nicaragua, A-1 intends to lease the
house to fans for $130 a month.

5. Our query why Adelaida, if she had AMBIDDY-1's
interests at heart, appeared to have qualms about oming up
in respect to past events, was parried by AMBIDOY-1 by claiming
that Adelaida was of course aware of all these rumors and had
warned his of possible political embarrassment.
6. Evaluating UFGA 16512 on the basis of our talk with
AMBIDUY-1, we conclude that its main source has a high batting
average. At least there appears to be a hard core of truth to
practically all allegations made, to the extent we ware able
to check them out. We would venture the gross that, despite
his protestations to the contrary, AMBIDDY-1 is quite conversant
with Adelaida's past history, but can see no practical gain in
so telling us.
He may reason that an avowel of intent to marry
a woman whose antecedents are in fact as described, would seriously
blemish his image and that by pleading ignorance now he can, if
things should get out of control, always strike a pose of injured
Innocence and elicit a 'here but for the Grace of God ge I" re-
action from his PBPRIME associates.
7. Agreement that all interested parties would benefit by
zoving Adelaida's abode from the WAVE area to Bicaragua was
reached on the basis of ANBIDDY-1's acceptance of our flat state-
mant that we view Adelaida as a potential hazard to AMWORLD's and
KUMARK'a security. He based this reasoning upon numerous indt
ications that Adelaide had become all but completely privy to
everything that was going on in AMWORLD and that her discretion
Left a great deal to be desired. We drew no dental from ANBIDDY-1
shen stating that Adelaide had become witting of the WAVE training
course for AMBIDDY-1 and that she presumably knew about KITBARK
support for ANJORLD. We referred to Adelaida's lesbian associates,
without stating that we suspected her of holding charter nembership
in that cererity. He antioned by name Aida FEREZ and Lucia CANO.
When the latter was labelled by us a lesbian believed to be in
Adelaida's complute cmtidende, AMBIDDY-1 evinced surprise and
fer recsene difficult to fathom almost disaay, we concluded by
stressing the importance of breaking up adalatda's strale of
associates and confidants as an indispensable prerequisite for
containing the threat her access to informatica we consider
classified represents and asked ANBIDOT-1 te sake sure that no
member of this group would follow her to Kisaragua.

8. We made no attempt, which in any case would have been
vain, to break up the relationship between AMBIDDY-1 and
Adelaida. We apologized to him for involving ourselves in
matters of a private and intimate nature which unfortunately
være beginning to impinge upon ODYOKE security interests.
