MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHAIRMAN, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF
Subject: Military Personnel Detailed to the
Central Intelligence Agency (C)
1. (C) In response to your request, attached at Tab A is
a summary of the service personnel currently on detail to
the CIA. The report includes a breakdown by rank and service,
and by country of assignment. The attached information was
provided by the Director of Personnel, CIA, because the
personnel systems of the two services providing the bulk of
the personnel are not programmed to respond promptly to your
request.
2. (S) In the pursuit of the requested information SACSA
learned that the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Systems
Analysis) on 11 August 1966 signed a letter to the CIA
approving the Agency request for military manpower spaces
for FY 1967. (Total 874, see copy of memorandum at Tab B.)
The entire action on the Agency manpower request was handled
by ASD/SA with the Services through Secretarial channels.
The JCS were neither consulted nor requested to concur in
this major CIA support action. However, it will be noted
that a copy was furnished your office.
3. (S) I believe that lack of involvement of the JCS in
the matter of the annual military manpower authorization to
CIA is a serious omission. It stems from an OSD/OSO directive
of 1957 which was pertinent as long as the Erskine-Lansdale
office existed. (Copy attached at Tab C.) When Lansdale's
office was disestablished in 1963 the OSD directive should have
been rescinded and replaced by an appropriate JCS directive.
With your approval SACSA will initiate the necessary action
with ASD/SA and CIA to insure that future personnel actions
involving CIA are properly actioned within the JCS organization.

MEMORANDUM FOR DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
SUBJECT: Central Intelligence Agency Military Personnel Requirements,
FY 1967 (U)
Reference is made to Central Intelligence Agency memorandum dated
June 7, 1966 to the Department of Defense which states the requirements
for military personnel to be detailed to the Central Intelligence Agency as

These requirements are approved. In approving this request, it is
suggested that personnel requisitions be submitted sufficiently in advance
of desired on-station dates to permit selection of individuals with the re-
quired prerequisites. The Army has stated, for example, that the desirable
lead-time for officers and senior enlisted personnel is 5 to 9 months, and 5
months for lower grade enlisted men. The Army also states that certain
initial intelligence MOS, particularly for positions requiring Spanish language
luency, may pose selection problems depending on the time the personnel are
required to be on-station.
It is agreed that reimbursement for personnel so detailed will be made
to the Services by the Central Intelligence Agency in accordance with the
Memorandum of Understanding between the Agency and the Department of
Defense, approved by the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, February 23,
1960.

furnished the respective Military Services.

Department of Defense Directive
Policies Governing Assignment of Military Personnel
to the Central Intelligence Agency
Reference: (a) Department of Defense Directive 1315.3, entitled
"Policies Governing Assignment of Military
Personnel to the Central Intelligence Agency,"
dated 9 December 1952 (cancelled herein)
I. PURPOSE
The purpose of this directive is to announce to all con-
cerned policies governing the assignment of military
personnel to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
II. CANCELLATION
Reference (a) is superseded and cancelled on the effective
date of this directive.
III. GENERAL POLICY CONSIDERATIONS
A. Representation and Liaison
1. Remirements. Certain military personnel should
be assigned to the CIA to provide adequate
military participation and support at appropriate
levels of the agency. This representation will be
in conformity with Department of Defense/CIA
policies. Personnel selected should be the best
qualified and most experienced available, with a
well-founded understanding of their own Service
policies, programs and requirements.
2. Assignment Qualifications. As far as practical,
the Services should provide personnel to the CIA
S-1553
NW 50955 DocId:32276318 Page 13
57
ATCH C
who are adequately trained for the function which
they are to perform insofar as the function is
one of common concern, to relieve CIA of a
requirement to furnish military-type training and
indoctrination.
3. Military Technical Skills and Experience. Certain
military personnel should be assigned to
CIA to
fill approved billets requiring persons with
technical skills and experience peculiar to the
Military Services.
4. Specialized Qualifications. The Military Services
should not be requested to furnish military
personnel to CIA to fill billets requiring
persons with language, area or other unusual
skills, experience or qualifications, which are
not intrinsic in military personnel, if such
qualification is the primary basis for the request.
B. Labor and Services.
1. In general the Military Services should not be
requested to assign personnel to CIA to perform
housekeeping functions, communication or clerical
duties, to render medical support, or otherwise
to be a source of labor and miscellaneous
services, if such duty is the primary basis for
the request.
2. Overseas, where a CIA activity is located near or
within a U.S. military installation, the local
military commander may, when requested by CIA,
and based on a specific agreement approved by the
Military Service concerned, provide services of
common concern, such as physical security, etc.,
to CIA as to other branches of the Government,
provided that such services can be furnished within
current local personnel allocations and subject to
fiscal reimbursements where required. Such
facilities, or personnel involved, should not
normally be turned over to CIA administration.
C. Remote or Undesirable Posts.
The Military Services should not be requested to
assign personnel to CIA to staff or support CIA
NW 50955 DocId: 32276318 Page 14
2
installations in undesirable locations or duties except
where the assigament of military personnel is agreed
to be the most practical solution. In such cases CIA
should exhaust every possibility to acquire the
personnel needed from the U.S. and indigenous civilian
labor pool.
D. Recall of CIA Employees.
Generally, recall of CIA employees to extended active
military duty is not considered desirable.
E. Unprogrammed Requests.
Unprogrammed CIA requirements not anticipated and pro-
cessed as part of annual personnel estimates, should
nevertheless be handled in the same manner as the
annual estimates, with such advance informal consul-
tation as may be required to expedite the process.
F. Training Agreements.
The provisions of this policy will not affect present
or future agreements which CIA may make with the
Services to provide military training for Junior
Officer Trainees of the Agency.
IV. OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FUNCTIONS.
A. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) should
continue to promulgate policies and procedures
governing military personnel support of the CIA,
and should receive CIA annual estimates of military
personnel requirements along with general justifica-
tion for all new positions. The OSD should then review
and process then to the Services for detailed consid-
eration. After receipt of comments from the Services,
the OSD should review them and make a consolidated
reply to the CIA.
B. Exceptions to any of the policies promulgated herein,
on a unique and emergency basis, may be negotiated by
CIA through the OSD.
V. DEPARTMENTAL PROCESSING
A. Each Service will examine the CIA request for personnel,
indicating recommended approval or disapproval to the OSD.
NW 50955 DocId:32276318 Page 15
3
B. The Military Services should take full advantage of
such information on acquired skills and experiences as
can be made available, by mutual arrangements between
CIA and the Services, on military personnel returning
from assignment with CIA.
VI. IMPLEMENTATION.
This directive is effective immediately and the foregoing
policies regarding military personnel assignment to CIA
should be put into effect by each Military Service on a
continuing basis at the earliest possible date.
