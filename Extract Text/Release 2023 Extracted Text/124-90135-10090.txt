1. A representative of this Agency received the
following information from a fairly reliable source who in
turn received the information on 20 January 1964 from
Jose ALONSO Costolla (A12 829 244), born 17 July 1931 in
Habana, Cuba, and is currently residing at 2940 N.E. 2nd
Avenue, Miami, Florida.
a. Arnaldo GUANAGA Barron, a United States
citizen who resides at 208 West 88th Street,
New York, New York, is a Communist. GUANAGA
according to Martin Martin PEREZ of 296 Saint Ann's S
Avenue, Bronx, New York, went to Cuba via Mexico,
but said that this information is not generally
known.
b. Nicolas MOLINA, brother of Francisco
MOLINA, aka El Gancho, was recently arrested in
New York on a counterfeit charge. Nicolas is
the owner of a restaurant known as "Eb Recreo".
which is a hangout for Eloy GUTIERREZ Menoyo
and his group. Also, Enrique ESTEVEZ, who was
involved in the same counterfeit charge as
Nicolas MOLINA, is now in Cuba, having returned
via Mexico.
2. The records of this Agency reveal no identifiable
information on GUANAGA and ESTEVEZ. There are many traces
on Martin PEREZ, with variations, however, due to a lack
of Identifying Information it is not possible to determine
SECRET

whether the Martin PEREZ in paragraph la above is
identical with any of the individuals that appeared in
the traces. If requested, traces on PEREZ will be
forwarded to the addressees.
3. The records of this Agency reveal that Nicolas
MOLINA, paragraph lb above, is probably identical with
Nicolas MOLINA del Rio, born 29 September 1928 in Habana,
Cuba, who was at one time of interest to this Agency; he
has not been contacted by this Agency since 1961. The
records also reveal that MOLINA has been subject of a
number of Bureau reports.
