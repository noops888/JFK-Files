17 SEP 1976
MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence
FROM : John H. Waller
Inspector General
SUBJECT : Jack Anderson Reference to 28 November
1963 CIA Cable
1. The Operations Group of CI Staff has provided a copy
of the cable about which you inquired. A copy is attached at
Tab A. It is a dissemination of a report by a British journalist
stating that a man named Ruby was in Cuba in 1959, where he
visited an American gangster-gambler named "Santos," who
was living luxuriously in jail. This dissemination was based
on a 27 November 1963 cable from London, a copy of which is
attached at Tab B. A follow-up cable from London on
29 November commented on the source of the story, raising
a question as to his reliability. A copy is at Tab C. A more
detailed statement about the man is contained in a report
passed to the FBI on 12 December 1963, a copy of which is
at Tab D.
2. On 7 January 1964 the FBI provided CIA with a report
that Jack Ruby did travel to Cuba in 1959; a copy is at Tab E.
On 30 January CIA provided additional information to the
Bureau on this subject; a copy is at Tab F.
3. The following points of coincidence are probably of
interest to Senator Baker: Jack Ruby did travel to Cuba in
1959, as stated in the report that gave rise to the present
query; the name "Santos" is also the given name of Trafficante,
although it is not clear that these are the same persons. While
there are reservations about the reliability of the source of
the report which gave rise to the present question, we are not
in a position at this time to evaluate it definitively. It is noted
that the description of "Santos" as living in luxury in a Cuban
prison is similar to a version also reported in a 16 May 1974
story in the Outlook Section of the Washington Post.

4. As you may know, an Agency task force has been
conducting an in-depth study of all information relating to
issues surrounding the Agency's support for the Warren
Commission investigation. This study has been underway
since early July and, because of the detailed nature of the
review, may require as much as another two months if it
is to be completed with the thoroughness that we believe
necessary.
5. OLC on 2 August called Liebengood of Senator Baker's
staff in response to a query concerning Jack Ruby's alleged
trip to Cuba. Unfortunately, on the basis of inadequately
researched information given OLC, that staff admitted to
knowing only about an allegation of a 1963 trip to Cuba by
Ruby put out as propaganda by an anti-Castro Cuban group.
The information did not include information in CIA's possession
on the 1959 trip by Ruby contained in the 1963 (Tab A) cable.
Madigan finally received from OLC a copy of the 1963 cable
on September 15, when the matter was straightened out and
the files properly researched.
6. As a relevant note on the question on whether or not
the Agency was purposely withholding the 1963 cable on Ruby's
1959 visit, we have been informed by the FOIA staff that at
least the following persons have been provided copies of the
cable:

7. As discussed with you, I think it would be useful for
my staff, specifically Breckinridge, to get Madigan out here,
describe to him our task force approach to the problem and
otherwise convince him that we are cooperating to the fullest
on this problem. We will coordinate this with OLC.

WILSON, Carlos John
(aka WILSON-HUDSON, Join
WILSON, John Hudson)
DOB: 29 December 1916
POB: Liverpool, England
OUT 85657, 28 November 1963
1. A usually reliable source, whose information was
evaluated as "possibly true", reported on 8 August 1951 the
following information concerning one Carl John WILSON Hudson.
a. WILSON, a Spanish citizen of British descent
residing in Chile, was a contact of one Bert SUCHAROV,
a suspected Soviet agent, in Santiago, Chile.
b. It had been ascertained that WILSON had
arrived in Chile on 28 January 1939 from Duenos Aires,
bearing Spanish passport No. 7, issued in Euenos Aires
on 4 January 1939 and visaed (tourist) by the Chilean
Consul in that city on 25 January 1939. He held
Chilean carnet 1.824.595 (Santiago) and resided at
Calle Arturo Medina 4207, Santiago.
c. Further background_data revealed that WILSON
was born in Liverpool, England, on 29 December 1916.
In July 1936 he had left his studies at Oxford Univer
sity in England to enlist as a volunteer in the Spanish
Loyalist Forces, whereupon he acquired his Spanish
citizenship.
:
d. Subsequent to his arrival in Chile, WILSON in
his capacity as a jornalist had opened a one-man crusade
against the British Government, in violation of restric
tions placed on such activities by foreigners in Chile.
He had been, in addition, masquerading under various
nonexistent titles as a result of which the Chilean
Government on 16 May 1939, at the request of the British

Embassy, issued a decree (No. 2344) ordering his
expulsion from Chile. Later, however, the decree was
rescinded as a result of WILSON's pleas, his state of
health and his promise to discontinue his misrepresenta
tion and other illegal activities.
e. In spite of his promises, WILSON had continued
these activities, numbering among others an anti-
Fascist campaign which he had associated with a "Uni-.
versal Peace Movement" to be brought about by the
elimination of all leading world powers. WILSON also
had frequently posed as a British RAF captain and had
worn the corresponding uniform.
:
f.
The strange mannerisms exhibited by WILSON
vére attributed to a mental illness, and following
WILSON's second outburst, the British Ambassador pre-
sented another request for his expulsion. Again,
Lowever, following various explanations by WILSON to
the British Embassy and on the renewal of his promise
to refrain from further activities of a similar nature,
the case was dropped.
2. On 7 October 1952, a usually reliable source, whose
information was evaluated as "possibly true," submitted the
following report concerning one Carlos John WILSON, who is
identifiable with the Carl John WILSON Eudson in paragraph
1 above.
a.
WILSON stated that he had arrived in Santiago
in 1947 and had worked on a special mission for the
British Government in Germany, Egypt, and Turkey at
the close or World War II. He stated that he had
fought with the Spanish Republican forces against Franco.
He was violently anti-United States and constantly
condemned United States policy. WILSON was of the
opinion that England and France would eventually join
with the USSR to form a pact aimed at the complete
destruction of the United States. He claimed to be an
authority on the Balkans, and was a strong supporter
of Tito. Tito, WILSON stated, would eventually line up
the entire Balkan area with En
England and Erance to assist
Russia in crushing the United States.
b.
WILSON was extremely interested in the
13-00000
3
Yugoslav colony in Santiago. He attended a large cele
bration given by the Serbian Orthodox Society at the
Club Ruso in Santiago. On this occasion he had become
intoxicated and made bitter resarks against the U.S.
While he was intoxicated he made confidential remarks
indicating that he was a member of an intelligence
service,
C. WILSON had an office on Calle Agustinas 1111,
which bore the following designation: "CINCEE, Commercial
Information." WILSON's business consisted of trade in
copper, lead, and sulphur. He stated that he was
involved in a secret "deal" in Antofagasta, Chile, in
which he planned to ship 15,000 tons of sulphur to
Holland,
d. WILSON was in contact with a man identified
as Heriberto Springvaller EINICKE, also described as
bitterly anti-U.S. EINICKE was believed to have.
studied in the U.S. between 1922 and 1930. He had
later become a colonel in the Nicaraguan Army but had
been expelled from the country. It was reported that ho
spent some time in Bolivie and was closely involved
with WILSON in his so-called commercial dealings.
e. WILSON was described as being very intelligent,
astute, and well informed on current events. He was
extremely sociable, friendly, a very heavy drinker, and
a free spender. liis physical description was as follows:
Apparent age: 38 years old (born circa 1914)
Build: Hadium
color of hair:
Brown
color of eyes: Blue-green
face:
long, large nose; small, slightly pro-
truding ears; ruddy complexion; stall
mustache; wears glasses
documentation: UN Press Pass No. 287, issued
in Santiago. Pass from the
International Police Section
of the Chilean Investigation
Service authorizing him to enter
Los Cerrillos airport in Santiago
at any time.
SOURCE COMMENT: Source was of the opinion that WILSON was
very probably an intelligence agent, since there was no
apparent reason for his great interest in the Yugoslav colony
13-00000
4
in Santiago and since his large income was of questionable
origin.
3. A usually reliable source reported 18 June 1959
that Carl John WILSON, British journalist, sent a cable to
the British Parliament and to the British Trade Union Fer
eration saying that he had confirmed that the U.S. Military
Attaches in the Caribbean were giving military advice to
dictators. He protested in the name of humanity, saying
that patriots were fighting for their sacred rights to be free
citizens and that American volunteers were helping the dic
tators with the approval of Washington. Source commented that
WILSON was planning on accompanying Hario CALERO, Nicaraguan
revolutionary who was readying an expedition against
Nicaragua from Cuba.
:
:
4. Another report dated 26 June 1959 from a usually
reliable source stated that Paul HUGHES, an American soldier
of fortune, claimed to have at his disposal three aircraft,
including one bomber, and planned to launch an attack on
Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, during the weekend of 27-28 June
1959. Hughes said that Carl WILSON, a British journalist,
and about 65 volunteers would join him in the attack. Source
commented that HUGHES also vaguely spoke of possibly bombing
Managua for the psychological effect. WILSON said that
Castro had no knowledge of HUGHES' plans.
5. United Press International carried the story date
lined 1 July 1959 from Havana, Cuba, saying that Police had
raided a private home in suburkan Biltmore the day before
and seized a large quantity of arms and arrested three.
Anericans and a Briton. The-Americans-were-identified as
Paul HUGHES, an officer in Castro's rebel army; Efren R.
PICIARDO, of Miami, Florida; and Joseph BARDOR, of Los
Angeles, California, The Briton was listed as Carl John
WILSON.
6. The U.S. Army Attache in Havana, Cuba, reported
30 July 1959 that he had received the following note from
Carl Job WILSON:
:
"Salvador ALLENDE, (Communist-sponsored presidential
candidate in 1953 and Socialist Party member) brought a
letter of definite instructions to Raul Castro (from
Chile.) This letter contains instructions from the
Kremlin in Moscow and contains the signature of Pablo
Neruda of Chile. It deals with definite instructions
of anti-American agitation to commence next month in
Chile, Peru, Eolivia, Cuba, Costa Rica, etc. Raul
13-00000
5
Castro is now under instructions of Salvador ALLENDE
of Chile."
Scurce, Carl John WILSON, was described as a British subject
and free lance newspaperman, who was arrested with Paul
HUGHES and who had been in jail ever since. WILSON reportedly
wanted to talk to someone. U.S. Army Attache showed the note
to the British Charge who agreed to send the Consul to talk
to WILSON and advise U.S. Army Attache if FILSON had anything
to add to the contents of the note. Nothing further vas
received.
7. Associated Press datelined 6 July 1959, Havana,
carried story about WILSON who said he had begun a seven
day hunger strike to protest his arrest and had to be fed
intravencusly at Cuba's National Police Hospital. Although
police dented WILSON was on a hunger strike, a hospital
intern said that he vas suffering from physical exhaustion
brought on by his refusal to eat. According to a 16 July
1959 Havana press report, WILSON's wife, a Chilean named
Eliana Bronfman, said WILSON had received a law degree from
Oxford University and had fought in the International Brigade
during the Spanish Civil War.
3. On 18 August 1959 WILSON walked into U.S. Consulate
Kingston, Jamaica, and said he was a journalist who had just
been released after 54 days detention in Habana prison, He
volunteered information about Cuba and Communist activity in
Latin America. On 21 August 1959 the U.S. Consulate in
Kingston issued WILSON a single entry noninaigraat visa,
He was carrying British passport 147356 issued in Havana
14 August in the name of John WILSON. He was attempting to
get air passage to Misai in order to sell his story to the
Miami Herald and then to obtain a new visa from Chilean
consulate to return home (UK or Chile not specified but
apparently he returned to UK.)
:
9. U.S. State Department cable from Asuncion, Paraguay,
reported 16 December 1959 that John WILSON, correspondent
for North American News Service, had informed the Paraguayan
Ambassador in London on 14 December that within two days a
cargo of 300 machine guns and 200 rifles were to be shipped
to Buenos Aires, Argentina, at the direction of Castro.
WILSON reportedly showed documents which proved his statement
13-00000
6
and requested remittance for passage to Asuncion to inform
fully on the shipment without pay.

Subject: JACK L. RUBY
LEE HARVEY OSWALD - VICTIM
CIVIL RIGHTS
Mr. Carlos Villa, 1450 Coral Way, Miami, Florida,
furnished to the FBI on December 21, 1963, a letter which
had been forwarded to a friend of his named Jose Antonio
Juan. Mr. Juan bad received the letter from his son living
in Cuba.
In the letter received by Mr. Juan from his son
the statement was made, "it is known here that Rubinstein
was here a little less than a year ago visiting a Mr. Pranski,
owner of a shop dealing in tourist articles, located on
Prado Street between Animas and Trocadero, opposite the
Sevilla Biltmore." The reference to Rubinstein appears to
refer to Jack L. Ruby who is presently in custody, Dallas,
Texas, on charges of shooting Lee Harvey Oswald.
For your information this Bureau's investigation
concerning Jack L. Ruby has developed no information that
Ruby has ever been in Cuba except on one occasion in 1959
when he visited there briefly on a vacation trip. Ruby
himself readily admits to this trip but has denied any other
trips to Cuba or contacts with persons there.
:
It is requested that, through available sources of
your Agency, you develop any information possible relating
to the above-quoted statement in an effort to resolve the
allegation that Jack L. Ruby has possibly visited Cuba since
1959 and has connections there.

Curry, chier
and their works Jesse (
chiel of the EURUS
Dallas' almost 1,20
ment, testified that no more than 25 to 50 of Dal
policemen were acquainted with Ruby. However, the reports of
present and past members of the Dallas Police Department as well as
Ruby's employees and acquaintances indicate that Ruby's police
friendships were far more widespread than those of the average
citizen.382
There is no credible evidence that Ruby sought special favors from
police officers or attempted to bribe them. Although there is consid-
erable evidence that Ruby gave policemen reduced rates,st declined
to exact any cover charge from them, and gave them free coffee
and soft drinks, as this hospitality was not unusual for a Dallas night-
club operatorssz Ruby's personal attachment to police officers
is demonstrated by reports that he attended the funeral of at least
one policeman killed in action and staged a benefit performance for the
widow of another.ass Ruby regarded several officers as personal
friends, and others had worked for him. 389 Finally, at least one police-
man regularly dated, and eventually married, one of the Carousel's
strippers.300
Underworld Ties
From the time that Ruby arrived in Dallas in 1947, he was friendly
with numerous underworld figures. One of his earliest Dallas ac-
quaintances was Paul Roland Jones, who was convicted of attempting
to bribe the sheriff of Dallas and engaging in the sale of narcoties,
Joe Bonds, one of Ruby's partners in the Vegas Club, had a criminal
record.392
315
Ruby, who enjoyed card playing 393 and horse racing, 394 was friendly
with several professional gamblers. In 1959, he visited Cuba at the in-
vitation and expense of Lewis MeWillie, a professional gambler.
Alice Nichols reported that Ruby's refusal to give up gambling was
one reason why she never seriously considered marrying him. When
Sidney Seidband, a Dallas gambler, was arrested in Oklahoma City, his
list of gambling acquaintances included Jack Ruby. And other
friends of Ruby have been identified as gamblers. Finally, two per-
sons of questionable reliability have reported that Ruby's consent was
necessary before gambling or narcotics operations could be launched
in Dallas,300
Based on its evaluation of the record, however, the Commission
believes that the evidence does not establish a significant link between
Ruby and organized crime. Both State and Federal officials have
indicated that Ruby was not affiliated with organized criminal activ-
ity.400 And numerous persons have reported that Ruby was not con-
nected with such activity. 101
Travels
Despite reports that Ruby visited Havana, Las Vegas, New York,
Chicago, Honolulu, and Mexican border towns, most of his time subse-
801

quent to 1947 was spent in Dallas. Some of his travels, including his
efforts in behalf of "Little Daddy" Nelson and his visit to New Orleans
in June 1963 have been discussed. 102 Ruby stated that he went to Chi-
cago in 1952, in 1958 when his father died, and in Angust 1963 when he
met members of his family at O'Hare International Airport while en
route from New York to Dallas. His Angust trip to New York
motivated by his difficulties with the American Guild of Variety
Artists and his desire to obtain talent, has been completely established
by hotel records. Early in 1963 Ruby also traveled to Wichita,
Kans., because of his interest in stripper Gail Raven, 40% and on May 25,
1963, ho apparently registered in an Oklahoma motel.400
Although Ruby denies being in Las Vegas after 1937,407 there are
unsupported rumors that he was in that city in late 1962,4ns and the
early part of November 1963. Reports that he was in Las Vegas.

There is some uncertainty about Ruby's trip to Havana, Cuba, in
1959. The evidence indicates that he accepted an invitation from
gambler Lewis J. McWillie, who subsequently became a violent anti-
Castroite, to visit Havana at McWillie's expense. Ruby apparently
met. MeWillie in about 1950, when McWillie operated a Dallas night-
club. MeWillie, whom Ruby said he idolized, supervised gamb-
ling activities at Havana's Tropicana Hotel in 1959 and later was em-
ployed in a managerial capacity in a Las Vegas gambling establish-
ment.415 Ruby testified that he went to Ilavana for 8 days in August
1959 and left because he was not interested in its gambling activities. 416
MeWillie corroborated this story except that he stated only that Ruby
visited Havana "sometime in 1959.47 Three Chicagoans reported
seeing Ruby in Havana during the Labor Day weekend in 1959.418
Meyer Panitz, an acquaintance of MeWillie, reported that when he
met Ruby in Miami during the "summer of 1959" Ruby stated that he
was returning from a pleasure trip to Cuba." The theory that the
trip to Havana had conspiratorial implications is discussed in chapter
VI. There is no reliable evidence that Ruby went to Havana subse-
quent to September 1959.120
Although Ruby denied ever being in Hawaii, there is some eri-
dence that during the summer of 1961 he was in Honolulu seeking
dancing talent. 422 While it is unlikely that Ruby would forget a trip
to Honolulu in 1961, there is no other indication that such a trip, if
it occurred, had any sinister motives.

family living in Dallas when Ruby returned to that city in late 1947.
In 1948, she returned to the west coast, visiting Dallas sporadically
