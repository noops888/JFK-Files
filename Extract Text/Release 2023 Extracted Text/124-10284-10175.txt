officefand
1959 to fly patrol in Camaguey Province. Due to the secrecy and the air of growing
excitement in in BAYO's office and an increased pace in bombing training, the

secretary believes BAYO is actually going on a bombing bombing mission connected with
a Dominican invasion. ( Field Comment: There have been persistent reports recently
of preparations in Cuba for a new invasion either directly against the Dominican
Republic or indirectly through Haiti.) (Headquarters Comment: BAYO is the son of
Alberto BAYO Giroud, who has been prominent in Caribbean revolutionary activities for
several years and who trained Fidel CASTRO's original force in Mexico..
