From General Counsel to General
Walters:
:
We have reviewed this case in
considerable detail. Technically,
the release signed by Nosenko:
could be asserted. In fact, however,
on the basis of the record, it appears
he is due this final payment and we
see no problem in your approving
it.

SUBJECT
: Sidney D. Stembridge
Acting Director of Security
: Deputy Director for Operations
Deputy Director for Administration
:
Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko
(Payment of Certain Funds
Previously Promised)
1. This memorandum submits a proposal for your approval.
The proposal is to immediately pay Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko
$28,500 in back salary in settlement of an Agency commitment
to him and to authorize a subsequent one-time payment of $10,000
to him directly or as a contribution to his retirement for
identifying a ranking British official, William Vassall, as a
recruited Soviet agent.
2. Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko is a 48-year-old former
Soviet intelligence officer who is currently employed as an
independent contractor by this Agency. Mr. Nosenko has for
some time been of the opinion that he is entitled to $28,500
in back pay. This amount represents the difference between
the salary actually paid to him during the 1 March 1969 to
1 March 1975 period and the $25,000 per year which was promised
to him at the time of his defection in February 1964. At the
time of his defection, Mr. Nosenko was also promised the addi-
tional $10,000 for identifying William Vassall, a British
Admiralty employee recruited by the KGB.
3. While serving as a KGB security officer with the
Soviet Disarmament Commission in Switzerland, Mr. Nosenko
contacted an American diplomat in Geneva on 5 June 1962 and
requested a small loan to repay official Soviet funds which
he had squandered. Based on this contact Mr. Nosenko was
recruited shortly thereafter by the Agency and he agreed to

work as an agent in place. On 15 June 1962 Mr. Nosenko
returned to the Soviet Union where he resumed his duties as
an intelligence officer with the Second Chief Directorate of
the KGB in Moscow. Mr. Nosenko worked in place in the Soviet
Union until January 1964 when he returned to Switzerland. At
that time Mr. Nosenko decided to defect and requested political
asylum in the United States.
4. Mr. Nosenko defected in Switzerland on 4 February
1964 and was brought to the United States under Public Law 110
on 11 February 1964. At the time of his defection, certain
financial commitments were made to Mr. Nosenko. These commit-
ments were substantiated in a conversation with him on
7 February 1964 and were documented in a 10 February 1964
memorandum to the Acting Deputy Director for Plans from
Mr. David E. Murphy, Chief, Soviet Russia Division (SR Division).
This memorandum stated as follows:
"First, I assured Subject (Mr. Nosenko) that I
was satisfied that he was genuine. Based on
this and assuming his continued 'cooperation'
I said we would proceed to make arrangements
to bring him to the States. Second, I con-
firmed our agreement to pay him $25,000 for
each year in place ($50,000) plus $10,000 for
his part in the Vassall case and our readiness
to contract for his services at $25,000 per
year. Third, I explained the polygraph he
would be expected to take as final proof of
his bona fides."
5. Shortly after his arrival in the United States, the
SR Division encountered serious difficulties in attempting to
establish the bona fides of Mr. Nosenko. The SR Division con-
cluded that Mr. Nosenko was not what he claimed to be and thus
was not a bona fide defector. As noted in paragraph four of
Attachment A, Mr. Nosenko was held under highly secure conditions
at an Agency installation from April 1964 until October 1967.
In October 1967 the primary responsibility for Mr. Nosenko was
transferred from SR Division to the Office of Security, which
conducted a thorough review of the developments in this case.
The conditions of confinement of Mr. Nosenko were progressively
relaxed and in October 1968 the bona fides of Mr. Nosenko were
established by the Office of Security. At this point it should
be noted that the confinement of Mr. Nosenko was cited by the

:
Rockefeller Commission Report in June 1975 and that Mr. Nosenko
is aware of this citation. Mr. Nosenko has, however, made no
threats concerning possible damages as a result of this con-
finement. Also, despite the difficult period through which
Mr. Nosenko passed, he has been and continues to be a coop-
erative and productive source.
6. Mr. Nosenko has been of significant value to this
Agency as a source of information on KGB Second Chief
Directorate activities against U.S. Embassy personnel in
Moscow. Mr. Nosenko named six members of the Embassy staff
who rejected KGB recruitment overtures during the 1953-1964
period, and all have confirmed his assertion. A physical
search of the Embassy in Moscow also fully substantiated
information Mr. Nosenko provided regarding KGB audio surveil-
lance devices in the Embassy. Mr. Nosenko also provided
information leading to the identification of fifty-one American
KGB targets and sixty-one non-American KGB agents. The most
prominent of these Soviet agents were a French and a Canadian
ambassador to Moscow, a director and a deputy secretary of the
Indian Foreign Ministry and a British Admiralty employee,
William Vassall. Mr. Nosenko is the most significant defector
we have had from the Second Chief Directorate of the KGB, and
as a result of this his contributions have been of unique
importance.
7. Prior to 1 March 1969 Mr. Nosenko received no salary
for his cooperation with this Agency. Effective 1 March 1969
Mr. Nosenko was employed as an independent contractor at the
rate of $16,500 per year. Because of the previous difficulties
and uncertainties involved in establishing the bona fides of
Mr. Nosenko, the extent of our commitments and obligations to
him were not clear at that time. Mr. Nosenko, therefore, was
not initially employed at the rate of $25,000 per year as he
had been promised. Mr. Nosenko's salary was increased annually,
however, until 1 March 1975 when he began to receive the stipu-
lated $25,000 per year. Once the bona fides of Mr. Nosenko were
firmly established and the earlier difficulties regarding his
status were resolved, the initial commitments took effect and
the payment of $125,000 (less federal income tax) was completed
on 16 November 1972 in settlement of salary arrears for the
period April 1964 to March 1969 (see Attachment B). On 12 July
1973 a final payment was made on the obligation of $50,000 due
Mr. Nosenko for the period 1962-1964.

8. There remains to be paid $28,500 (less federal income
tax) in salary arrears for the period 1 March 1969 to 1 March
1975 (see Attachment C) and $10,000 outstanding for the Vassall
case. (He has never requested the latter amount but the
obligation still exists.) Although Mr. Nosenko signed a
quitclaim for the period prior to 12 July 1973 (see Attachment. D)
and may have legally waived his right to back salary prior to
that date, the earlier payment of $125,000 for the period 1964-
1969 recognized our commitment to Mr. Nosenko to honor all
agreements and established a precedent for paying him the total
salary difference. We also believe that we have a moral obli-
gation and that this obligation should be met.
9. This matter is being brought to your attention since
Mr. Nosenko believes he has a valid claim to cited back salary
for the 1969-1975 period and in connection with the current
transfer of full responsibility for Mr. Nosenko to the Counter-
intelligence Staff, Directorate of Operations. It is, therefore,
recommended that you approve the expenditure of $28,500 in full
payment of back salary for Mr. Nosenko for the period 1969-1975.
Of the $28,500, $27,667 can be paid for out of the FY1974 unobli-
gated balance allotted to the Office of Security, with the
remainder of $833 being charged to the Office of Security FY1975
allocation.
10. It is further requested that approval be granted for
the $10,000 Vassall obligation, which could be paid directly to
Mr. Nosenko at a later date or preferably could be incorporated
into a retirement program for him, which is being given consid-
eration by the Counterintelligence Staff. If approved, these
transactions would represent a fulfillment of all commitments to
Mr. Nosenko as of this date and would serve to fulfill outstanding
Agency commitments to Mr. Nosenko prior to his transfer to the
Counterintelligence Staff.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence
THROUGH
SUBJECT
: Executive Director-Comptroller
: Retroactive Reimbursement of
Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko
1. This memorandum suggests action on the part of the
Director of Central Intelligence; this action is contained in
paragraph 9.
2. Mr. Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko, a 45-year-old, former
Staff Officer of the Committee for State Security (KGB) of the
USSR, attended the Institute of International Relations, Moscow,
from 1945 to 1950; was affiliated with Russian Naval Intelligence
during the 1951-1953 period; and was an officer with the KGB
from March 1953 until his defection to the Agency in Geneva,
Switzerland, on 4 February 1964, after having worked for CIA
for approximately two years.
3. A review of Mr. Nosenko's case reflects that, at the
time of his defection, various official commitments were made
to him, including a lump sum payment of $50,000.00 based upon
his nearly two years' work inside the KGB; a $10,000.00 bonus
for his work on the Vassal case; and a contract as a consultant
at a salary of $25,000.00 per annum. Mr. Nosenko was advised
by his Agency Case Officer that Mr. Nosenko was working for
the Central Intelligence Agency as of 5 February 1964, and that
his salary began from that date. This was a verbal agreement
with the Agency Case Officer, and is fully documented in our
files.

4. In the early debriefing of Mr. Nosenko, it became
apparent that he was a particularly complex individual. To permit
extensive and prolonged debriefing, arrangements were made to
accommodate Mr. Nosenko under highly secure conditions at
ISOLATION, where he remained from 1964 to 1967. These tight
security arrangements were dictated, during the initial phases at
least, by the additional need to provide Mr. Nosenko with
continuing personal protection, since there was the distinct
possibility that he would be targeted for execution if the Soviets
should discover his whereabouts.
5. Since October 1967, the primary responsibility for Mr.
Nosenko has been in the Office of Security, which conducted a
thorough review of prior developments in the case. Mr. Nosenko
was moved to the Washington, D. C. area in late 1967, and the
case passed through various stages of phased normalization, as
he was given an increased degree of freedom and independence.
Mr. Nosenko was actually resettled on the economy in April 1969;
he obtained a divorce from his former Soviet spouse in September
1969; and he later married an American girl in October 1969.
During the period from October 1967 to April 1969, Mr. Nosenko
did not receive a salary, but he was provided with a moderate
amount of spending money.
6. As of April 1969, Mr. Nosenko signed a one-year
contractual agreement for $16,500.00, including a clause giving
assistance to him in resettlement expenses in the amount.of
$8,000.00. In March 1970, Mr. Nosenko signed a new contract
for two years at $18,500.00 per annum. At about this same time
he was provided with certain financial assistance, $20,000.00
being for the down payment on a new house, and $5,000.00 for
other related household expenses. Mr. Nosenko's contract was
renewed at the new rate of $19,500.00 per annum on 1 March 1971,
and the contract was again renewed in February 1972, at the salary
of $21,000.00 per annum.
7. An analysis of this case clearly indicates that Mr.
Nosenko has been an extremely valuable source, one who has
identified many hundreds of Soviet Intelligence Officers, and he
has otherwise provided a considerable quantity of useful information
on the organization of the KGB, its operational doctrine, and
methods. At least a thousand formal memoranda have been
EYES ONLY
SECRET
14-00000
EYES ONLY
forwarded to the Federal Bureau of Investigation based on data
from Mr. Nosenko. He has conducted numerous special security
reviews on Soviet subjects of specific intelligence interest, and
he has proven himself to be invaluable in exploring counterintelli-
gence leads. He recently authored a book which is of interest to
the Agency. In effect, Mr. Nosenko has shown himself to be a
productive and hard working defector, who is "rehabilitated" and
favorably disposed towards the Agency.
:
8. In the course of a recent meeting with Mr. Nosenko,
he brought up the subject of his missing salary, covering the
period from April 1964 to March 1969. Mr. Nosenko readily
admitted that he is living very well at the present time, but he
is not in a position to save any money for the future. He also
expressed deep appreciation to the Agency for the financial
assistance which was provided him through the years, and he
considers this to have cancelled out the original Agency
obligation of a lump sum payment in the amount of $50,000.00.
Mr. Nosenko, however, still feels quite strongly that he is
entitled to be reimbursed for the salary which the Agency did
not provide him over a five-year period. He understands, of
course, that income tax would have to be deducted from this
back salary of $25,000.00 per annum.
9. In summary, the original oral agreement with Mr.
Nosenko is fully documented and supports his claim; his resettle-
ment since 1967 has been relatively smooth, with no significant
security problems having developed; and he continues to function
at the present time as a highly productive and useful source of
information on the KGB. In view of these various considerations,
it is requested that this payment of $125,000.00 to Mr. Nosenko
be approved. These funds would be paid out of unliquidated
obligations applicable to lapsed appropriations (Fiscal Year 1970
and prior years--"M" Account).

Deputy Director for Operations
SUBJECT
: Retroactive Payment to
Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko
1. Action Requested: This memorandum contains a recommendation
for your approval.
2. Basic Data: For your assistance, reference is made to the
attached memorandum of the same subject dated 5 October 1972. The pro-
visions of the reference were concluded with Mr. Nosenko, covering back
salary from April 1964 to March 1969, in October and November 1972 when
he was given the sum of $87,052.00 covering total salary for this period
less Federal income tax. It is estimated that Mr. Nosenko has invested
all but approximately $15,000.00 of this sum in the purchase of property
and construction of a new residence in North Carolina.
Instant memorandum is addressed to the lump sum payment of
$50,000.00 promised to Mr. Nosenko by an Agency representative prior to
his defection from the KGB in February 1964. Against this sum in April-
May 1969, Mr. Nosenko was given $8,000.00 as financial assistance for
resettlement on the private economy and $25,000.00 in mid-1970 towards.
the purchase of a new house and other related expenses. Mr. Nosenko
also agrees that he was given approximately $2,000.00 in March 1964
which should be included as a part of the above $50,000.00. In essence,
$15,000.00 remains outstanding against the above $50,000.00.
Recently Mr. Nosenko has rather specifically mentioned the
matter of the promises to Mr. Nosenko in 1964 and the remainder of the
financial promise which he did not receive. Mr. Nosenko considers the
WARNING NOTICE

SECRET

SECRET

amount to be $13,000.00 but this is based on his recollection that he
received $10,000.00 in April-May 1969 rather than the $8,000.00 which
he actually received. As noted in the reference, as of October 1972
Mr. Nosenko had indicated that the funds previously paid to him would
cancel out the 1964 lump sum promise. However, since October 1972,
several incidents have occurred which have had a strong effect on his
outlook on life and his personal situation. In late 1972, the wife of
Mr. Nosenko suffered a heart attack requiring hospitalization and con-
tinuing treatment which was not fully covered by the health insurance
provided by the Agency. Due to the particular circumstances involved
in the Nosenko case, it was not possible to obtain coverage for
Mr. Nosenko and wife under a group type health insurance policy.
On 18 May 1973, Mr. Nosenko suffered the loss of two toes
in a lawn mower accident and the prognosis for full utilization of the
other three toes, particularly the large toe which is required for
balance, is still in doubt. Mr. Nosenko is currently faced with the
obvious fact that he will be somewhat physically handicapped, the extent
of the handicap not known at this time but in the mind of Mr. Nosenko
it could very well lessen his usefulness to the Agency and perhaps
duration of full employment.
Mr. Nosenko has requested the previously mentioned $13,000.00
which will be used for investment purposes in connection with his new
property and residence construction and payment of medical bills. He
has voluntarily stated that he will sign a document agreeing that the
$13,000.00 is in full and final settlement of the 1964 lump sum pay-
ment promise.
As you will note in the reference, another promise made to
Mr. Nosenko prior to his defection in February 1964 concerned a $10.000.00
bonus for his contribution to the exposure and arrest of a British
citizen, William J. C. Vassall. Mr. Nosenko has never mentioned the
above promise while the responsibility of the Office of Security since
October 1967. It is noted that the promise of the above $10,000.00
was apparently not a matter of discussion with Mr. Nosenko prior to
his defection but was in the way of a gratuitous addition by the Agency
representative when Mr. Nosenko was adv advised that following previous us dis-
cussion he would be given a $50,000.00 lump sum for resettlement and
employment at $25,000.00 per year. Since none of the above remarks
were ever formalized in a document to Mr. Nosenko, it is very possible
that Mr. Nosenko does not recall the additional remark concerning pay-
ment in connection with the Vassall case.

3. Recommendation: In view of the above, it is requested that
a payment of $15,000.00 to Mr. Nosenko be approved, thus settling the
specific $50,000.00 lump sum promise made to Mr. Nosenko in February
1964. If approved, Mr. Nosenko will be advised that the $15,000.00
figure is based on an accounting of Agency financial records and a

that the additional $2,000.00 would be very well received by Mr. Nosenko
and will partially offset his recent medical expenses not reimbursed
from his current health insurance.
