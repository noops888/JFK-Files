c. DBA 78315 dated 19 August 1964 (FBI):
Concerns Andrew G. BUCKNER aka Andy BUCKNER, and "Little
Caesar".
An FBI source reported that two employees of the Washington
Iron Works, Inc., Sherman, Texas told him that Harold TOTTEN, owner of
the business, and an employee, Andy BUCKNER, had made statements critical
of the U.S. Government and of high Government officials. Both TOTTEN and
BUCKNER reportedly had made so-called business trips to Mexico City in
the past. BUCKNER was reported to be purchasing agent for the firm.
BUCKNER had made remarkos among the firm employees that he believed Fidel
CASTRO of Cuba and Nikita KHRUSHCHEV of Russia to be smart people. Both
BUCKNER and TOTTEN criticised U.S. Govt policies and opposition to the
U.S. blockade of Cuba. They criticized the policies of both Presidents
Kennedy and Johnson. A few days before Pres. Kennedy was assassinated
on 22 Nov 1963, BUCKNER remarked to some of the firm employees that he
had read news stories about President Kennedy's planned trip to Texas and
thought "it would be funny" if something should happen to him. On the
afternoon immediately following Pres. Kennedy's assassination, BUCKNER
and TOTTEN were at the Iron Works, and after having heard of the
assassination, said it could not have been them because they were at the
Washington Iron Works at the time it happened. TOTTEN received newspapers
and literature from time to time in the names of John R. BRINKS and Thomas
E. EDWARDS.
BUCKNER reportedly was hotheaded, thus the nickname "Little
Caesar."
/Have asked Ops Liaison to obtain photo of BUCKNER from FBI to
determine if he is iden/with "Unidentified man".

The FBI contacted BUCKNER in Sherman, Texas on 28 Jan 65 for
an interview. He admitted receiving publications from China and the U.S.S.R.
TOTTEN was contacted by the FBI in Sherman, Texas the same day. The FBI
agent said in his opinion TOTTEN was a dangerous individual and a
"potential OSWALD." He considered it unsafe for an agent to contact him,
at his office and if an agent walked into TOTTEN's office, "he might
get a belly full of lead."

A Andy Buckner
"Little caesar"
A
Johnny E. Morris, 210 East Jones, Sherman, Texas, on
April 28, 1964, volunteered information that had been received
by him from two employees of Washington Iron Works, Inc.,
Sherman, Texas. He said they told him Harold Totten, owner of
Washington Iron Works, Inc. and Andy Buckner, an employee of
Totten, have made statements critical of the United States
Government and of high Government officials. Totten reportedly
at about the time of this interview, was in the company of
Buckner on a business trip to Mexico. He understood that they
have in the past made other so-called business trips to Mexico
and possibly other foreign nations. He could not identify any
other foreign nations to which they may have travelled and he
could not provide an explanation for their travel, being
allegedly of a business nature.
DL T-1, contact with whom has been insufficient to
judge reliability of his information, on May 7, 1954,
advised Harold W. Totten, Sr. is President and General Manager
of Washington Iron Works, Inc., 312 Kast Lamar, Sherman, Texas,
and Andy Buckner 1 Purchasing Agent, employed by that firm.
Informant said that Andy Buckner adveral months ago at the
Washington Iron Works made comments among employees there that
he believed Fidel Castro of Cuba and Nikita Khrushchev of Russia
were smart people. He and Harold W. Totten, Sr., at that
establishment in recent months, have expressed themedres by
criticising policies of the United States Government and stated_
opposition to the U. 8. Blockade of Cuba. They also have
criticised President Kennedy and President Johnson concerning
their policies. They also have nade remarks to the effect
they believe Fidel Castro knew what he was doing and that the
Informant stated that a few day
before President Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963,
Buckner remarked to some of thecaployees at Vasbingtea Iren
Works, Inc, that he had read nove stories about President...
Konnody's planned trip to Texas and thought "it would be funny"
if something should happen to him. He made these remarks as a
V. 8. should leave him alone.

continuation of his further criticism of President Kennedy's
policies. Informant recalled that on the afternoon inmediately
following President Kennedy's assassination, Buckner and Totten
were at, the Washington Iron Works, Inc., having just heard about
the assassination, and were saying that it could not have been
then because they were at the Washington Iron Works at the time
it happened.
DL T-1 further stated that since that date, Buckner
and Totten have said nothing further along those lines but
both have remarked since that time that President Johnson is
not any better in' their opinion. Informant stated that on
various occasions, Totten and Buckner, with other employees at
Washington Iron Works, engaged in discussions about what
Khrushchev and Castro have done. Informant stated Totten in
the past has been anti-Semitic in his sympathies and beliefs
and claims he believes the Jews will take over the United States
because they "rule the money". Informant understood Buckner
is an atheist believing in no supreme power. Informant has
no knowledge that either of them has been arrested for any
offense.
DL T-1 stated that Buckner and Totten left Sherman
Texas, on April 25, 1964, a Saturday, and travelled to Dallas,
Texas, in a company car driven by M. C. Anderson, a Negro
porter employed by Washington Iron Works, Inc. At that time,
Buckner and Totten were supposed to have travelled fron Dallas
to Mexico, destination and purpose of travel being unkwa
to informant. They were gone from Sherman only a few days and
both were back to work at Sherman on April 28, 1964. Informant
stated Totten's secretary, Dorothy Stewart, took a vacation trip
to Mexico City in about the Summer of 1962. So far as
informant knows, she has expressed no sympathies for Russia or
Cuba. Informant said she is loyal to her employer, Totten.
1
DL T-1 stated Totten receives newspapers and literature
from time to time in the names of John R. Brinks and Thomas E.
Edvarde,
Informant believes the literature is of anti-communist
nature. Informant stated Buckner is hotheaded and has the
nickname of "Little Caesar" which he has had for six or eight
years. Informant stated one Patrick at the Sherman Auto Works
at one time was a partner of Buckner before Buckner began
working for Fashington Iron Forks, Inc.; that Patrick and Buckner
a few years ago had a "parting of the ways".
