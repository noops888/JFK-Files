MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, SE Division
ATTENTION : Division Security Officer
FROM : (Thomas L. Briggs)
SE/X/LA
SUBJECT : Appearance As Witness In Behalf of the
United States Government
REFERENCE : USA V. Gerald P. Hemming, Et Al. (76-371-CR-CA) -

1. During the period of my employment as a Special Agent at the
Drug Enforcement Administration (May 1974 - Jan 1977), I conducted an
interview of Gerald Patrick Hemming (DPOB 1 March 1937, at Los Angeles,
California) on 23 May 1975 at DEA Headquarters in Washington, D.C.
My report concerning that interview has become part of the case file
in USA v. Gerald P. Hemming, Et Al., Case Number 76-371-CR-CA,
Southern District of Florida, Miami, Florida.

2. Upon my entrance on duty in SE Division on 5 January 1977,
I orally informed the Division Security Officer, Billy Hix, about
the information in paragraph 1 above. Mr. Hix asked me to submit
the information in writing as soon as I was settled in the Division.
On 7 January 1977, however, Special Agent Robert Fredericks
telephonically contacted (Hope Mason, DC/SE/X/LA, and told her that
the United States Attorney, Southern District of Florida, had
requested that I appear at the U.S. Courthouse, Miami, Florida on
10 January 1977 to confer with the Assistant United States Attorney,
Karen L. Atkinson, regarding my appearance as a witness in behalf of the
U.S. Government in the trial of Gerald P. Hemming.

3. During the afternoon of 7 January 1977 I conferred with Mr. Hix:
who advised me to contact the Office of the General Counsel. I talked
to Mr. Edmund Cohen who advised me to get in touch with the Office of
Security, External Activities Branch (OS/EAB). I completed an
Outside Activity Approval Request (Form 879), obtained the concurrence
of DC/SE, Mr. John Stein, and submitted the Form 879 to OS/EAB.
OS/EAB sent me to Central Cover Staff (Mr. Blandford) and then to the
Office of the General Counsel. After discussions with Mr. Cohen, I called

S/A Fredericks in Miami at Mr. Cohen's suggestion. S/A Fredericks was
not available. Mr. Cohen then advised me to return to my office and
he would contact me with further instructions. Mr. Cohen retained
the Form 879. Subsequently, Mr. Cohen advised me that I should travel
to Miami as requested and that CIA would reimburse me for expenses
connected with my activities in behalf of the U.S. Government. He
further advised me that being in an overt cover status I should state,
if asked under oath, that I am currently a CIA employee.

4. On 10 January 1977 I traveled to Miami where I met and
conferred with USA Karen Atkinson and DEA S/A Robert Fredericks.
They informed me that Gerald P. Hemming's case had been severed and
his trial would not begin on 11 January. AUSA Atkinson told me she
wanted me as a rebuttal witness if Gerald P. Hemming presented the
defense that he had been working at the direction of DEA. She said
they would not call me until and unless that defense was presented.
She also said that she felt that any attempt to question me concerning
my current place of employment was irrelevant and she would object to
any such line of questioning. She said she would only ask me where
I was employed at the time I interviewed Hemming. I returned to
Washington D.C. the same day.

4. INTELLIGENCE REPORTING
On May 23, 1975 Gerald Patrick HEMMING walked in to
Drug Enforcement Administration Headquarters, 1405 I Street,
N.W., Washington, D.C. 20537 and asked to see Mr. Lucien
Conein, who is the Acting Chief, Special Operations and Field
Support Staff. HEMMING told CONEIN that Mitchell Livingston
WERBELL III had given HEMMING CONEIN's name as a DEA official
to whom HEMMING could talk. HEMMING told CONEIN that he wanted
to provide information on drug trafficking between Colombia
and Florida. CONEIN asked SA Thomas BRIGGS to conduct a
debriefing of HEMMING since SA (BRIGGS) was working on the
collection of narcotic intelligence concerning Colombia and
Florida.
HEMMING stated that he is presently employed at TECPOLE
Security, 801 Madrid, Suite 105, Coral Gables, Florida, telephone
305-443-9681 or 305-446-8379. (HEMMING stated he believed
that 443-9681 was being tapped, he did not say who he believed
was tapping the telephone) He stated that he has extensive
experience in paramilitary air operations, having served in
CASTRO's rebel army and then with several anti-Castro groups
operating from Florida in the 1960's. He claimed extensive
knowledge and experience in all types of air operations.

In August 1974 HEMMING was approached by Armando BOLET,
a Cuban veteran of the 2506 Brigade whom HEMMING had worked
with in anti-Castro activities, and by John VARESE (nfi),
to help them organize and run air smuggling operations for
The O'DONNEL brothers, using
Thomas and William O'DONNEL.
the cover of their construction firm in the Ft. Lauderdale
area, (AMERICAN EASTERN DEVELOPMENT) were involved in maritime
smuggling of marijuana from Colombia to Florida. During an
unspecified four years (probably 1970-74) the O'DONNEL'S had
averaged approximately six-seven loads of marijuana per year
at three-four tons for each loads smuggled into Florida.
Of these 24-28 loads of marijuana they had to jettison into
the sea only five loads for security reasons. The rest of the
loads had been successfully delivered into Florida.
The source of the marijuana in Colombia is Dr. Arturo
ROMANO-Fedullo of Barranquilla, Colombia. Besides running the
smuggling for ROMANO, William O'DONNEL handles the laundering
of the money accumulated by drug trafficking through banks
in Grand Cayman, Switzerland, and Curacao.
Armando BOLET convinced the O'DONNEL's that they should
add air smuggling to their narcotic trafficking methods and
that they should also try cocaine in addition to marijuana.
BOLET told the O'DONNEL's that there were many experienced
men available in Florida who could be used to smuggle drugs
into Florida by air. BOLET was especially interested in cargo
parachute drops and parachute jumps by individuals carrying
loads of cocaine. BOLET recruited HEMMING to help organize
these activities. A common technique used by BOLET and HEMMING
was to fly an aircraft into Florida legally, but to have a
parachutist jump onto a pre-selected drop zone in southern
Florida prior to landing the aircraft. This way, police
authorities never found any contraband on the aircraft and the
dropped narcotics would not be lost because the parachutist
carried them on his person. If he missed the drop zone he could
simply fold up his parachute and walk to the location of the
reception committee. BOLET uses a DC-3 tail-number N1099 and
a Navajo Chieftain tail number N7678L in his smuggling operations.
HEMMING had a falling out with the O'DONNEL group and
decided to leave them. He is now associated with Carlos
CARABALLO who operates a charter fishing business and traffics
in drugs. HEMMING decided to inform on the O'DONNEL'S for
revenge and in order to try to eliminate the competition.
