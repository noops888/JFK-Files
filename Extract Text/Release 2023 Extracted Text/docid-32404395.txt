MEMORANDUM FOR NORA SLATKIN
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
SUBJECT: JFK Assassination Records: Release of CIA Information
(b)
The Department of State supports the CIA's request that the
President exercise his authority to postpone disclosure of any
document related to the assassination of President Kennedy which
would implicate high Mexican officials in joint intelligence
operations against foreign embassies in Mexico City. The
Department shares the CIA's concern that such disclosure could make
Mexican officials reluctant to engage in joint intelligence
activities. The Department also shares the concern that disclosure
would lead to a curtailment or complete shut off of information
from several on going sources. (b)
In addition, release of this information would damage US
relations with Mexico and it could also have unfortunate
repercussions for US relations with Russia, especially during this
heated period of their presidential election campaign. Finally, as
a matter of policy the US government does not confirm that it
engages in the monitoring of telephone calls from diplomatic
premises here or abroad. Release of this information could subject
the US and Mexico to strong criticism from foreign governments.
