SUBJECT: Jose DIAZ Castano also known as Joseph C. DIAZ
1. This Agency is in receipt of information on Jose DIAZ
Castano, also known as Joseph C. DIAZ. It is as follows:
BRACKETS
KP 5-12-98
Subject is the President and Secretary of an
organization named Americans For Civic Action" with
headquarters at 11 Roosevelt Avenue, Jersey City 4,
New Jersey. He reportedly is the leader of "manifestations"
in the United States against Spain. It has been alleged
that he subsidizes propaganda which is sent in large
quantities to various places in Spain, mainly to certain
officials and including Franco himself. DIAZ has had
contact with Spanish opposition groups, and it is said
that he may have also contacted Communist groups.
2. This Agency would greatly appreciate any information which
the Bureau has available on this Subject and his activities. It
has been noted that there is some information already on hand at
this Agency on a Jose DIAZ which originated from the Bureau, but
there is not enough identifiable material to determine whether
they are the same individual.
3. Based on the fact that the data in paragraph 1 above is
sourced by a Spanish service, it is requested that only the files
of the Bureau be checked.
