ABSTRACT
MICROFILM
1. The Warren Commission's Report on the assassination of
President Kennedy focused attention on the magnitude of the problem.
involved in the protection of the Chief Executive. As you know, it is
our responsibility, overseas and in headquarters, to render every
support possible to the Secret Service in the conduct of its statutory
responsibilities in the United States, and especially when the President
travels abroad,
2. The circumstances confronting the Warren Commission
produced discussion and testimony on various aspects of the problem
of Presidential protection and on interagency operational cooperation,
which normally do not find their way into the public domain. These
include the acquisition and dissemination of information, consultation,
coordination, and operational interchanges. I believe you will be
interested in the attached extracts of testimony given before the Warren
Commission by U.S. intelligence and security officials. Pertinent
Fortions have been side lined. I commend these materials for reading
by all officers in positions of senior responsibility in headquarters and
overseas.
