Estimate of Number of CIA Employees
Involved in Support of Warren
Commission
1. We have surveyed DDO, DDA and DDI components for
a statement of the number of employees engaged in support of
the investigation by the Warren Commission. It was difficult
to reconstruct this with any reliability, many of those involved
no longer being available. Names have been taken from old
records and the memories of those involved in some way at
the time. We cannot with reliability be sure how much time
of each was involved.
2. We estimate that very close to 50 professional employees
were involved in this activity on either a daily or recurring
basis. We have identified twelve of these being involved on a
daily basis. There obviously were others involved on occasion,
but not regularly. In addition there were a number of secretarial
and clerical employees who provided support, but who are not
counted; the number may be greater than the fifty professionals
estimated above.
3. Attached for your information, but not for release to
the Downing Committee is the summary work sheet on this. This
memorandum is classified Confidential because of its attachment.
The information in this memorandum can be extracted and passed
to the Downing Committee on an unclassified basis.
