INTERNAL SECURITY - CUBA
On September 25, 1962, an informant who has furnished
reliable information in the past learned that Gonzalo Facio,
Costa Rican Ambassador to the United States, had contacted
Jose Airo Cardona, head of the Cuban Revolutionary Council,
an anti-Castro organization, on that day. Facio and Miro
Cardona discussed a television tape made by Facio which was
scheduled to be released on September 30, 1962. In that
tape Facio advocated massive open aid to Cuban exiles.
The two also discussed Panama's plan for a Central
American alliance against Castro. Miro Cardona indicated he
was aware of this plan and liked it but was of the opinion
that it lacked enforcement ability. Facio felt there should
be some reaction on the part of the Caribbean countries.
Miro Cardona stated there was no doubt that these countries
were in danger and had a solid position for some action.
The informant also advised that Facio was in contact
with Tony Varona, believed to be Manuel Antonio de Varona,
associate of Miro Cardona's, on the same day. In commenting
on the then forthcoming Foreign Ministers Conference, Facio
indicated that he felt the conference would result in nothing.
This is for your information.
