DATE & PLACE
: Safehouse #182, 29-30 August (0900 - 1300 hrs)
CASE OFFICER
: Claronce E. SMERYAGE
1. Subject began to work against the CASTRO regimo with the MRP in
1960. At that time he was employed in the Santa Clara power plant as a
technician. His job was controlling the amount of electric current that
was distributed. (Attachment "A" contains a list of Subject's friends
currently employed in power plants in Cuba). On 17 April 1961 Subject
made contact with a KUBARK infiltration team and began to assist the team.
Team consisted of Segundo BORGES and AMARGO/1. Case
Officer Comment: AMARGO/1 has confirmed the fact that Subject worked
with his team In Cuba. Subject permitted the team to install their RS-1
set in his house located at #219 Carretera de Camajuani in the City of
Santa Clara.. He also safehoused the team on occasion and permitted them
to hold meetings at his house. After the failure of Playa Giron the
team reorganized the MRR in Las Villas Province, selecting Subject to
be the Civil Coordinator of the movement in that province.

they also were going to the power plant to arrest him. Subject also
learned that there was surveillance on his home on the night of 22 July
1961, but the person watching the house had gotten drunk and did not see
subject when he returned from Havana. From that moment until entering
an Embassy on 6 September 1962, subject lived "black".
3. Subject proceeded to the outskirts of Santa Clara where a friend,
Efrain WAREN, resided. His friend told him to go to Havana. While
driving to Havana Subject met another person who informed him that the
G-2 had a roadblock on the highway at Colon, Matanzas, and that all cars
were being searched. On 24 July 1961, Subject went to a beach called
"GANUZA" located on the north coast of Las Villas near Corralillo.
Subject's sister has a home at "Ganuza" so he left his car there and
proceeded to Havana with some friends of his sister. Later the G-2
confiscated his auto. (It is interesting to note that the G-2, after
confiscating subject's auto at the beach, believed that Subject had
departed from Cuba. Subject thereafter communicated with his wife by
sending her letters in jail via Miami where they were postmarked).

4. On 25 July 1961 Subject went to the house of an MRR leader, FNU
in Havana. When Subject approached the house he noticed a
"blind move as if someone was watching" so he did not go in. He walked
two blocks to a bus stop. From the bus stop he could observe
and he noticed that a car departed at a "high rate of speed". Later that

subject when he returned from Havana. From that moment until entering
an Embassy on 6 September 1962, subject lived "black".
5. From October 1961 Subject resided with Ester CRUZ a person he
had known for 10 years. While living with CRUZ he changed his appearance -
lost much weight, dyed and curled his hair, obtained contact lenses.
(C/O Comment: Ester CRUZ was arrested approximately 9 May 1962 during
the "roll up" of the MRR. She is in jail at this time). In November
1961, Subject met

6. In late November, 1961. Subject moved into a "guest house" where
several other MRR members resided. House is called House of Maria de la
GALLEGA and is located on "J" Street between 21st and 23rd Streets,

called Subject here in Miami on 28 August and wants to talk with
him).
8. MUGARRA informed AMBRONC/5 that he had doubts about Juan BUSTAMENTE,
Aka "Roly", as he had asked too many questions re what AMBRONC/5 had
brought to Cuba. AMBRONC/5 decided to call a "false meeting" of the
chiefs of the movement to test BUSTAMENTE but "someone objected to this".
In February 1962, a meeting of the leaders of the MRR took place and
AMBRONC/5 reorganized the movement. Subject met AMBRONC/5 only twice
once in February 1962 at the house of

March, 1962 when the assassination of Juan MARINELLO failed. The
Operation failed as the automobile to be used in the assassination attempt
was stolen on the day of the proposed Operation. The driver of the car
was to be Orlando CRUZ, brother of Ester CRUZ. The MRR suspected
Orlando CRUZ after this incident as he is a person who "likes money" and
the theft was"quite a coincidence". (Orlando CRUZ is presently in Miami.
He called Subject on 28 August and wants to see him). AMBRONC/5 informed
the group in March to suspend all operations until he returned from a
trip he was taking to the USA with MUGARRA and

The only persons who knew the locations of the sets were the Radop,

Enrique CEPERO and MUGARRA common-law-wife waited for them in the
Blue Studebaker Lark. AMBRONC/5 and MUGARRA were late in arriving, however,
and the group had departed from the area.
10. Subject later discovered that the G-2, had captured a "large radio"
in the apartment of a radio technician named TROVADIUS. TROVADIUS, when
captured, fired at the G-2 and was himself wounded in the shoulder. Later
TROVADIUS reported that he had seen Juan FALCON in prison and that FALCON
had said "people in the G-2 had told me that no one would be wounded or
killed".
11. The Radop (AMBUMP/1) informed subject on Wednesday (9 May 1962)
to take the radio set out of the house. Rumors were already circulating
that the Radop and
were captured. Owners of the house where the
radio was cached had moved to Santa Clara for Mothers' Day. As Subject
was in contact with
during this time he did not attempt to
pick-up the radio until Thursday (10 May) at 0700 hrs. Subject entered
the apartment building (12 stories high) by the rear. Upon arrival he
discovered that the glass doors on the terrace were opened (apartment
was located on the eleventh floor). These windows are seldom opened.

Subject entered the building with his briefcase containing a pistol. He
noticed two men "loit loitering in the lobby". He took the elevator to the
9th floor, departed, and walked to the eleventh floor. Subject was
wearing soft shoes He walked quietly to the apartment and heard a voice
say don't talk so loud as no one will come in:. Subject then proceeded
to the next apartment occupied by a friend of the movement. The friend
said she had heard noises since the preceding night in the apartment.
Subject then took the stairs to the 9th floor and entered the elevator.
He got off on the ground floor and proceded to the house on Carlos
Tercero Ave. where the other radio was cached (Owner's name is

house was outside in her housecoat talking to a stranger. Subject then

to pass this information to Arturo MUGARRA but MUGARRA had disappeared.

Estar CRUZ and
were arrested. When
subject heard of these developments he hid in the Tuanabo area. During
this period 9th to 28th of May, he saw MUGARRA approximately eight times.
He later heard that the G-2 had taken over a house in Guanabo; located 3
blocks from where he was hiding. Subject heard that the G-2 had taken a
"blond thin man there": (Possibly AMBRONC/5). G-2 remained at the house
for four days.
13. Subject then departed from Guanabo for a few days. When he returned
in June 1962 he met Sylvia LNU; the person who resided at the house where
the "blond thin man named CARLOS was taken. Sylvia and subject met in the
water in front of their houses. Sylvia is the wife of a BATISTA Naval
Captain who lies in Miami. She has two "little girls". Sylvia said that
"CARLOS" used to live at her house and after being captured he was returned
there with the G-2. The G-2 was searching for a "plastic case and
envelopes" (pads and crystals). Sylvia told subject that she had seen the
envelope and that when Enrique CEPERO's family informed her that he was
captured she hid everything in the house that could incriminate "Carlos"
under the dog house in the back yard". "Carlos" talked as if he had
been drugged when he returned to the house with the G-2. They searched
the entire house bringing "Carlos" back and forth several times for four
days. Sylvia was forced to open the door whenever anyone arrived and the
caller was arrested. Sylvia was interrogated and the house was under
surveillance for approximately a month. A friend of Sylvia's from outside
Cuba visited her during this period and was arrested and held for a week
Sylvia said the items she buried looked like "pads and maps wrapped in
plastic". Although she claimed the material was turned over to the MRR
subject has doubts that this was done.

Mexico City via Safe Conduct.
