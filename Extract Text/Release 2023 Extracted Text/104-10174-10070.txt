MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, CI
SUBJECT:
Operational Approvals for Former
Ambassadors to Italy:
LUCE, Clair Boothe C-71976
ZELLERBACH, James David 3-11016
1. Before he left to assume his duties as COS, Rome,
Mr. William Harvey asked that we check into the present status
of Operational Approvals on Subjects, A check of CI/OA re-
vealed that one on Mrs. Luce expired in 1958, and that there
had recently been one active on Mr. Zellerbach for CCS use
only.
2. It would be appreciated if OAs could be given to
Subjects so that Mr. Harvey may be permitted to speak with
them at any time in the future should they visit his area, or in
the event that he seeks to see them whenever he is in the United
States. Since it would be difficult to determine a time limit for
keeping such Ons active, it would be appreciated if they could
be given for an indeterminate period.
