PROCEEDINGS
Mr. Wallach. Mr. Angleton, on behalf of the Committee,
3

5
let me express our appreciation on the record for your coming
back again. As you recall, I was present for a portion of the
testimony that you gave to Mr. Johnson on the Houston Plan, and
I still think for this session that the oath that was applied
at that time would still pertain.
8
Do you understand that you are still under oath?
9
10
Mr. Angleton. I don't know. You know the regulations.
Mr. Wallach. In any event, you at that time were also
11
given then, you were advised of your rights to counsel, etc.
12
13
14
15
I take it, once again, by the fact that you have come without
counsel, that you have taken to waive that right.
Is that right?
Mr. Angleton. That's right.
16
Mr. Wallach. The subject matter that we'll be discussing
17
18
19
20
2.1
here today primarily focuses upon the New York mail intercept
program that was run by the CIA for approximately 20 years.
I realize you've already given some testimony on this,
both for the record, for the Commission, and briefly touched upon
it as a sidelight to Mr. Johnston's examination, and I will try as
22
best I can not to be repetitive.
I, of course, have access
23
24
25
to the Rockefeller material and have read it, and we will try
again not to cover the same ground except insofar as I would like
to hit upon certain specifics that I don't believe we've gone

I also have some documents here I would like to show you

in varying degrees that will have to be read, and I think we can
take them one at a time, and you will be given an adequate chance
5
to read them, and should we reach a determination it is necessary
6
7
to do so, the minute there are any questions on them, we can
do that for each document.
8
Mr. Angleton, do you recall when you became aware that there
9
was a mail intercept project in New York City?

I don't know the date, but I assume that I
learned of it through Herman Horton, who was my Deputy in 1954.
Mr. Wallach. At that time it was being run by the Office
of Security, is that correct?
Mr. Angleton.
That's right.
Mr. Wallach. Did there come a point in time when the
8
operation was taken over, at least the substantive parts of the
9
operations as compared to the procedural and mechanical aspects
10
CI
11
of gathering together and intercepting the mail, that this was
taken over by the CIA, staff?
12
Mr. Angleton.
That's right.
13
Mr. Wallach.

When was that, sir?
Mr. Angleton. Well, there is a chrono on this entire
thing. I think the best chrono is this report, if I can find
it in the Rockefeller Commission. '55, I believe, at the time.
Mr. Wallach. Is the document you are looking at now the
attachment, prepared for the Rockefeller Commission and submitted
the day you testified there?
20
Mr. Angleton. That's right.
21
The time was 1955.
22
23
Mr. Wallach. Given that approximate time, Mr. Angleton,
do you recall how the decision was reached that CIA_staff would
CH
24
take over the project?
25
Mr. Angleton. Well, I think there was a question, I think

1 there were a number of matters involved here. I think one of
2
3
them was that security was undergoing some kind of freeze.
Second, I believe the Division wanted out. I think there were
4
a combination of factors which led to the feeling on the part
5
of many that the program would be discontinued for lack of
6
funding and personnel. The other point is that Mr. Horton
7
8
9
10
11
12
had very close relationships with the Office of Security and
I assume they went to him on it because even though there is a
memorandum by DiSilva to the effect that the project was not
to be used for counterintelligence purposes, that is very
unrealistic, because Mr. Timm, who put up the project, was
himself a counterintelligence officer. lle had been formerly
13
14
15
FBI, and then he was OSS counterintelligence during the war,
in fact his whole career was in a professional sense in counter-.
intelligence.
And I don't feel that the thrust of it was
16 entirely positive intelligence in his mind.
17
I knew him extremely well.
18
Further, there was, which I have not seen reflected in
:
19
20
21
the papers I have read, the security was very much involved
operationally in terms of penetration of the Agency in
security cases, and this goes back to the post-OSS period,
22
at least after the war when I was abroad, and there were a lot
23
of hearings on penetration of OSS, and this was supported by
24
some very highly sensitive documentation, Soviet in nature, to
:
25
the extent of penetration and security were charged with this

1 problem of trying to clean out the combination of Communist
2 Party members, probably Soviet intelligence, and also known
3
4
homosexuals which also were in the counter-intelligence side.
So, I think that what the record does not reflect is that
5
6
7
there were very strong counter-intelligence stressed by the
very people who, in a sense, played a part in the originating
of the entire program.
8
And I find that conflict with, as I say, DiSilva or Doran,
Dana Durand?
9
Dan Doran, or he stated or made some comment that it should
10
11
not be a it was not for counter-intelligence purposes, that
it was entirely misleading.
12
13
And in the penetration part of it, of the problems con-
fronting security, Mr. Horton had much to do with that as well
14
as Mr. O'Neal. In other words, there was a very firm
15 relationship going back into all of the other kinds of cases.
16
17
18
Mr. Wallach. I'm not entirely sure I understand, when
you talk about the Office of Security at that time probably
continually being occupied with penetration, how that would
19
affect their handling the project. Are you talking strictly
20
21
about manpower, because it is my understanding that project
still took up a heck of a lot of time for the Office of
22
Security in terms of manpower.
23
Are you talking about manpower down at Headquarters?
24
Mr. Angleton.
No.
I only saw and noticed the effect that
25
in one of Herman's memos which he drafted, he talked about the

Mr. Angleton. Well, I just want to see if I can see this
to find anything
(Pause)
Mr. Wallach. In one of the documents there is reference
5
to the fact that openings have been going on for some time. I
6
think that is a year after this document, I think it is a '56
7
document that that is in.

now wish to carry out the second step of this arrangement, and
Mr. Angleton. Well, this is so repetitious that
(Pause)
In '53, December, they are discussing this, saying we
13
12 that is to photograph the fronts and backs of first class mail.
Mr. Wallach.
I think the first step there just might have
15
14 been a survey to see how much mail came in and out.
Are those documents entirely related to the New York
16
project, Mr. Angleton?
17
Mr. Angleton.
Either that or collateral.
18
Mr. Wallach.
Do you have any objection to letting us take
19
a look at them?
20
Mr. Angleton. Well, I would rather leave that to the
21 Agency. I was supposed to see the General Counsel and I have not
22 been able to get a hold of him.
24
25
23
Mr. Wallach. I don't understand what seeing the General
Counsel
Mr. Angleton. Well, I mean, I was supposed to get the
TOP SECRET
1 freeze in Security, the fact that Security were hamstrung for
2 personnel, etc, and starting out in '55, the staff having been
3
pulled together in '54, we did have a lot of slots and we had
4
5
6
a lot of latitude,, that it would be very natural in terms of
the associations for someone to put up to the staff for taking
away the project.
7
Mr. Wallach.
This might be kind of a hypothetical that I'm
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
going to pose, but if you really don't feel that you can give an
answer on it, just let me know.
For example, if Security had continued with the project,
would they have had the expertise to really do anything with it
besides really straight, positive intelligence? I think you may
have suggested that, that there was sort of a natural gravitation
to CI staff once it developed.
Mr. Angleton. Yes, I think there was a natural gravitation
I think the Security's interest, they would have been able to
17
handle, but it would have been a very small slice of the project!
18 In other words, theirs would have only been personnel, and then,
19
in correspondence within Agency people, and Soviet units and
:
20
so on.
21
Mr. Wallach. I would like at this time, Mr. Angleton, to
22
show you a document that I will just ask the Reporter to subse-
23 quently mark as Angleton Exhibit 1 for identification of
24
this date. It is -- I am not actually sure whether it is
25
one memorandum

Mr. Angleton.
I have seen this. It is a fairly involved

memo.
3
Mr. Wallach.
The reason I said not to look at it thoroughly
4
is there are a lot of facts and figures that we'll be going into,
5
but do take a look at it.
6
Mr. Angleton. Well, if you want to call my attention to
7
any specifics in it.
8
Mr. Wallach. Well, just take a quick look through and I'll
9
call your attention to a couple of specifics.
10
My first question was going to be whether or not you
11
recall this before. In fact, there is some handwriting on I
12
guess the third page and fourth page, and I wonder if that is
13 yours.
14
Mr. Angleton.
Birch
No. No, I don't recognize it. It might have
15
16
been Bert O'Neal's. I'm not sure.
Mr. Wallach. But in any event, you believe you at least
17
saw this document at some point in time.
18
19 recently, but this is apparently a draft, is it not?
Mr. Angleton. I have seen it, certainly after, you know,
It is a
20 draft document?
21
Mr. Wallach.
Does it say that on it? Why do you say
22
23
apparently?
Mr. Angleton. Well, it wouldn't be a document with all
24
of these corrections on it.
25
Mr. Wallach.
We are unable to determine if we got it from

an individual's file or not, or if someone just may have made

comments on it or crossed things out after they received it.
3
Mr. Angleton. No, no. This thing looks as though it had
gone from one party to another.
Mr. Wallach. I agree. For example, on page 6 there are
portions crossed out and additions made.
Mr. Angleton. It looks very much like a paper that was
8
run through a staffing process.
9
10
11
Mr. Wallach. In any event, we haven't found a final
version, if there is one. So this is all we have to work from
at this time.
12
13
I don't think I'll have any questions on the portions that
are crossed out or handwritten in.
1.4
15
16
Mr. Angleton. The language is very much like O'Neal's.'
Every "i" is dotted and every "t" is crossed.
Mr. Wallach. When the project was taken over by CI staff,
17
18
was it then a mail opening project or was it just a mail inter-
cept, mail cover project?
19
Mr. Angleton. Well, I really don't know. It could have been
20
21
22
23
24
25
both. It could have been in the process of changing, but I had
a feeling that openings had been taking place before.
But the paragraph 5 which I am looking at now

under the conditions existing now, our personnel are getting

It is possible,
2 discretely to gain exclusive access to the contents of a limited
3
number of selected communications, and I think that secus to
4
be at variance with some other paper I have also seen.
5
I thought an earlier part, that openings were taking place.
6
Mr. Wallach. Are the documents you're looking at now
7
copies of documents that went into the Rockefeller Commission?
8
Mr. Angleton. No. I got it from a fellow. I haven't

examined it.
10
Mr. Wallach.
From whom?
11
Mr. Angleton.
From the project
no, not the project
12
but one of the men who's still back on the staff.
13
Mr. Wallach: Mr. Tsikerdanos?
14
Mr. Angleton. Yes.

(Pause)
Mr. Wallach. While Mr. Angleton is looking through the
17
18
19
20
21
documents I would like to explain, going a bit into the
Rockefeller Commission, that there is some question as to
whether or not there was ever explicit authorization in terms
of switching from a mail intercept, mail cover to a mail
opening project.
22
Mr. Angleton.
I understand the question.
23
Mr. Wallach.
But I think a couple of later documents
24
suggest that
-- well, I will let Mr. Angleton finish looking
25
through the documents that he has.
