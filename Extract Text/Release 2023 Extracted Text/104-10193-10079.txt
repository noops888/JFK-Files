having entered on duty from OSS and its successor organizations. Her
career is highly distinguished by virtue of consistently strong to out-
standing performance, all of which is fully documented.
In addition to several staff and desk assignments, Miss Goodpasturė
served in support of the successful coup against the communist government
in Guatemala in 1954 and completed tours of duty in Bombay, Monterrey and
Mexico City. Undoubtedly, the high point of her career occurred during
her service in Mexico City from 1957 through 1970, where she served as a
"trouble-shooting" case officer for the incomparable Winfield Scott
(deceased), who was then the Chief of Station: Mr. Scott, a stern task-.
master, described Miss Goodpasture over these years as "intelligent, hard-
working, conscientious, versatile, valuable and unquestionably one of the
most competent CI/CE officers he ever had the privilege of working with."
Miss Goodpasture's fitness reports were totally consistent with this
appraisal, and were characterized by outstanding ratings. In her final
assignment prior to acute medical problems, she worked for the CI Staff
(October 1970-October 1971), earning the following remarks from her
supervisor: "...I venture to rate her overall performance, thirty years
of it, as Outstanding. Ann is one of the tough warp-threads on which
this organization is woven, and when she retires the fabric of this organi-
zation will be weakened." The reviewing official agreed with the above
and recorded his hope that Miss Goodpasture get the official Agency recogni
tion she so richly deserves for the many years she has made substantive
