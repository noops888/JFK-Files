JFK Death Halted
Cuban Oil Raid
THE SUPPRESSED STORY
can now be toid of how the
Central Intelligence Agency
organized a Cuban exile raid;
on Cuba's key oil refinery in
1963 but aborted it after the
assassination of President
Kennedy.
Insiders sav the corporate
cil giants, hoping eventually
to recover their property in
Cuba, brought quiet pressure
to quash any raids upon re-
fineries. Lyndon Johnson,
who canceled the raid after
succeeding Sir. Kennedy in
the White House, was close
to Texas oil interests.
We have learned the dra-
matic details from Bradley
Avers, a 36-year-old former
Army captain, who was se-
lected by the CIA to train
Cuban exiles for infiltration
and assault missions includ.
ing the refinery rald in Ma-
tanzas province.
We have checked out
Ayers' story with our own
sources, who confirm he is
correct about names, places
and dates. From a group of
pictures, Ayers also was able
to pick out inmediately a
CIA undercover operative
who we knew had been in-
voived in the CIA raids
against Cuba.
The rugged Ayers, a for-
mer Army ranger instructor,
trained the refinery raiders.
The recruiting for the mis-
sion had already been com-
pleted before he was as-
signed to the project. CIA of-
ficials took him by motor
launch through swampy Ever-
giades canals and across the
open sea to secluded Florida
Keys to meet the recruits,
as
Ayers and the CIA men se-
lected Palo Alto Key, Upper
Key Largo and Card Sound
on the edge of the Ever-
glades
training sites.
"Most of the Cubans," said
Ayers, "were bank clerks,
busboys, waiters, inusicians,
laberers, men who had fied
to the United States. Many
had never fired a weapon.
They were disorganized and
undisciplined. I got the job
of reorganizing the training
program."
?
!
AYERS ran off simulated
raids near Card Sound
against a local Southern Bell
microwave facility with a
high security fence. Other
nights, he shared black beans
and rice, drank and sinoked
"pot" with his Cuban-cadre.
The rag-tag recruits grad-
ually became a fichting team.
For firsthand experience, he
secretly accompanied two in-
filtration groups on missions
to Cuba.
a
"We went on a commer-
clally rigged trawler.
'cover' vessel," he said. "We
ran blackout under a quarter
moon, towing a V-20 launch, a
high-powered fiberglass boat.
"We exchanged light sig-
nals with the partisans
ashore in PPinar del Rio and
launched two rubber boats.
The team made contact with
the partisans, and we picked
up a wounded man who'd
been a prisoner of Castro.
But the Cuban partisar.s
were careless with the lights.
"After we got the wounded
man into a rubber boat, we
were discovered by a Soviet-
type patrol craft with spot-
lights. We covered our with-
drawal with machineguns
from the V-20 boat. Although
we took casualties, we finally
got back to the trawler. Our
boats were pretty well shot
up.
"On the way home, we saw
a Cuban fishing craft flying a
distress flag and found it had
a load of refugees. We took
them on board."
A second sortie to cache
supplies for agents already in
Cuba was less eventful. Fi-
nally, in September, 1963,
Ayers was instructed by the
CIA to make detailed train-
ing plans for the refinery
raid.
He was given specific or-
ders not to land en Cuba
himself during the raid. But
he was too emotionally in-
volved with the Cubans'
cause to stay out and wrote
himself into the plans. "We
were all on a live-for-today,
tomorrow-we-die philosophy,"
he explained.
But on the day of the final
rehearsal, President Kennedy
was killed, and the CIA or-
dered Ayers to shut down the
operation. "I was in a sort of
trauma," said the swashbuc-
kling instructor. "I made
trips to Washington to plead
the cause of the freedom
fighters with the minor offl-
cials I knew. But I just got.
disappointed and angry."
or
Finally in October, 1964,
Ayers resigned from active
duty with a long statement of
principle to his CLA and
Army superiors. "As a sol-
dier, I had been taught I
shoubin't question political
diplomatie action," he
wrote. "But as a free-think-
ing American citizen,
couldn't subordinate my
duty. My country was no
longer playing to win, and
my faith in the goals to which
I dedicated my life
