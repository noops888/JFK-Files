:
Ref: I Reports 2988-3 and 2989-3
1. We thought the attached reports would be of interest to Lincoln
Staff from a Soviet realities standpoint. We also felt that they should
be brought to the attention of Division management because the M.O. out-
lined therein is becoming a major factor in dealing with sources who have
contact with Sovbloc nationals. It has been our experience that the type
of activity outlined has been on a mrked increase, particularly since
the establishment of the KGB 10th Directorate. Although such activity
by Sov legals is taking place throughout the continental U.3., undoubtedly
its greatest impact is being felt in the New York and Washington, D.C.
areas because of the large Soviet Government establishments in both of
these cities. For this reason it would seem imperative that both WAFO
and NYFO be extremely vigilant for such activity in companies and insti-
tutions with which they are dealing in order that it may be recognized
in its earliest stages and appropriate CI/CE countermeasures instituted.
In order to assist other offices in this respect, we plan to write in the
near future an article for the Division Newsletter, outlining some of our
experiences along these lines.
2. We were somewhat disappointed in CI Staff's reaction to our
recent request for assistance in defensive briefing of the subject of
one of the attached reports. It seems to be quite clear now that our
original assumption concerning his being R.I.S. targeted was quite correct
and that there is a strong likelihood that his current trip behind the
Curtain vill be utilized by the opposition for provocation and/or an
actual recruitment attempt. We wonder in future cases of this nature
exactly what support we may expect from Angleton's shop. Although we
feel that we have a fair capability for handling such matters here in
New York, we do admit that, at least on this one, we would have felt
slightly more comfortable had a CI specialist been along, if for no other
reason than to preclude any possible Monday morning quarterbacking by the
"old pros."

3. Judging by the attached material, it would appear that, despite
established Bell policy (see our 16 May memorandum re Case 39,790), the
opposition has seen fit to deflower at least two of Bell's scientific
virgins. We serjously wonder at this point just how many other Bell
people might be in the same boat. Perhaps, as a result of all this,
some representation by Bell management to the KGB will be forthcoming,
spelling out to that organization, as was spelled out to our own, estab
lished company policy pertaining to such matters. In any event, it would
appear that at least one or two Bell scientists, and there are probably
more, have been giving the R.I.S. more cooperation and reporting than the
Agency. Let's hope that in the near future Bell management takes some
effective steps to rectify this rather ludicrous, and patently dangerous,
situation.

Because of his US employment and the fact that Bell paid for his trip,
became very apprehensive about any further contact with the
West German service and at the time of the call indicated that he had
nothing to say and wanted no further contact. Other tien the cursory
examination of credentials (us reported above),

had not mentioned the Bulgarian visit in
outlining his original itinerary to Bob Martin of this office, there-
fore, it vas not mentioned in
Coordination Outline.
11. All of the above would seem to indicate quite strongly that
, as we originally surmised, has been targeted by R.1.3. In
briefing
we ran through some of the typical entrapment
situations fabricated by the opposition, e.g., women, homosexuals,
purchase of drugs for Sov citizens, black market activity, acceptance
of letters to mail outside the USSR, commitments to disaffected Sovs,
etc. In addition, we stringently admonished
against any
notetaking or photography which could in any way be construed as con-
promising. We also alerted
to the fact that some attempt
might be made to use his wife's family as leverage in a recruitment
attempt. In this connection, we pointed out to
that there
was a strong likelihood that the R.I.S. and/or Bulgarian service would
make an approach to him during his forthcoming visit to Sofia. An
approach in Bulgaria would give the Sovs an opportunity for disavowal
and also would provide the proper setting for maximum utilization of
relatives. When
mentioned that his sister-in-law, FNU
had indicated several times in the past that she would like
to leave Bulgaria, we strongly admonished him against making any com-
mitments to her, pointing out that she may possibly be co-opted by
the opposition. We told
that any representations to gain
an-exit visa for his sister-in-law should be channeled through the
US Legation in Sofia. ☐☐ was told that, if any pressure were
applied concerning his wife's family, his best reaction would probably
be a noncommittal, "I'll think it over when I get home:" All in all,
we alerted
as best we could to the opposition M.O. and pre-
pared him on how best to avoid some of the not so obvious pitfalls
which might be in store for him.
12. Prior to our briefing of
management to all of the ramifications of
Bob Martin alerted Bell
travel behind
the Curtain. The management was informed by Martin that ve felt it
our obligation to point out to them the strong possibility that
had been targeted in order that they would have all of the facts avail-
able before signing off on his trip.

13. Assessment of
Subject, a very accomplished
scientist, heads up all acoustics research at Bell. He reads
Kussian and is fluent in German, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch,
and English. He impresses us as being a rather savvy, discreet,
cooperative, mature, stable, well motivated individual. We attri-
bute
apparent lack of discretion in his dealings with
the Bovs more to the subtlety of the Sov approach than to his own
naivete. It has been our experience that most US businessmen and
scientists are very susceptible and vulnerable to the opposition
approach mainly due to somewhat of a lack of realistic public
education.concerning contacts with Sovbloc nationals. We feel
that
degree of cooperativeness with US services has
been enhanced considerably by his feeling that he has really been
taken for a ride by the opposition.
Incidentally, when we asked subject for permission to release this
information with source disclosure to the FBI, he was at first some-
what apprehensive and expressed the desire to talk it over with one
of his Bell superiors before he made any commitments. He finally
agreed, however, when we convinced him that it would certainly be in
his best interest to get on record with the FBI as soon as possible.
Most of his apprehension about the FBI seemed to be attributable to
the fact that he has just been granted US citizenship and, in addition,
18 now somewhat concerned that his activities with the Sove in some
way may effect his security status which in turn could be very detri-
mental to his career.
Based on our limited contact with
we have every reason to
believe that he would be suitable for operational use, should the
bureau choose to pursue such a course.
14. We would strongly recommend that all of the above be passed
to the Bureau ASAP in order that that organization may effect contact
with
☐ and provide him with proper guidance concerning any
further approaches by Sor or Bloc nationals in this country.

1. During routine debriefing of
of Bell Labora-
tories in connection with his recent USSR visit to attend the Poyov
Society Meeting, 5-14 May, Moscow (see NYOR 8878 for Coordination Out-
1 line) subject mentioned having had recent contact with a Soviet Govern-
ment representative in this country. The Soviet in question identified
Chimself to as Gleb Aleksi Pavlov and gave his address as 1216
First Avenue, Manhattan.
2. According to
his initial contact with Pavlov took
place in late March following the International Convention and Show
of the I.B.E.Ε., 25-29 March, New York City (see Case 39843). At the
convention
became friendly with two Soviet counterparts in
invited
attendance, A. V. Tiel and Anatole Trutka, both of whom
to his home for a social visit during their US stay. When the Sovs
departed for home following the convention,
saw them off at Nev
York International Airport. It was at the airport that he first met
Pavlov, who apparently was seeing off all of the Sov I.E.E.E. delegates.
After the Sov delegation had departed,
and Pavlov returned to
Manhattan together and, on parting, exchanged addresses.
3. A couple of weeks after their initial meeting, Pavlov tele-
phoned
at his home and told him that Tiel and Trutka had asked
him to send their warmest regards to
and thank him for the
hospitality which he showed them during their trip to this country.
During the conversation, Pavlov expressed an interest in renewing his
acquaintance with

9. During his recent trip to the USSR, it would appear that

of opposition fabrication. One involved an approach by a Soviet
interpreter by the name of FNU Petrov, who took
aside and
asked him if he could do him a personal favor by getting him a sub-

Lan attractive young female Interpreter, Ludmilla Oshkina. According
to
when one of the Soviets in their party vas about to take
a picture of him standing next to Ludmilla, another individual stand-
ing nearby was pushed out of the way apparently so that he would not

claims to have pushed her arm away just
as the photo was being snapped.
7. Assessment of

Subject strikes us as being extremely
naive and unrealistic. He appears to be more apprehensive about his
dealings with CIA than his dealings with Soviets. In fact, when
was asked if he would mind if a tape recorder vere used for debriefing,
he became very nervous and expressed a fear that, if such a tape vere
made, perhaps the Soviets might gain access to it and use it against
him in some way at a future date.

Popov Society Meeting. When we asked for a photostat of same, he
again expressed misgivings and indicated that he would prefer to have
a typewritten copy prepared for us instead of a copy in his own hand-
vriting because he was fearful that it might fall into Soviet hands..

We inquired of
why he had not mentioned Pavlov to us during our
defensive briefing of him before his trip. He replied rather nebulously
that it was his understanding that it was company policy that our oniy
function in seeing him before his trip was to give him a defensive brief-
ing, and that, since no debriefing was involved at the time, he felt no
obligation to volunteer the information concerning Pavlov.
It is our opinion that
s obvious naivite, apparent lack of sophisti-
cation, and extreme apprehension concerning dealings with our Agency would
make him most unsuitable from the standpoint of operational utilization
by the Bureau.

8. We would strongly reccomend that all of the above be passed to
the Bureau ASAP in order that that organization may effect contact with
in time to provide him with proper guidance concerning any further
approaches by Pavlov or other Sov legals in US.

:
1. I attended the Third International Congress on Acoustics. 1-8 Ropt 50,
Stuttgart, West Germany.
2. While at this Congress I met a Soviet female scientist, L (histovich,
who is connected with the Pavlov Institute of Physiolog, Leningrad.
One day during the Congress I took a walk in the Black Forest with
L Chistovich and another Soviet scientist. After a short time, the
other Boviet scientist excused himself saying that he had to rejoin
his colleagues.
3. In June 1963
an acoustician with bell Telephone
Laboratories, was in the USSR. On his return to the US he told me that
he had heard while in the USSH that L Chistovich, on her return from
the 1959 Stuttgart Congress, had been placed under house arrest. He
also said that he had seen L Chistovich while he was in the USSR, and
he had asked her whether it was true that she hat been placed urmer
house arrest on returning from the Stuttgart Congress.
Chistovich's only reply was to blush.
He said
4. I suspect that the individu who repres L Chistorich to the scien
was Yuriy Pavlovich Lysanov. He in connected with the Ascetics Institute
in Moscow. He publishes very little and his conduct. ha. seeme! corange to
me. He was in the United States in 196-1997. 1 murped that the fact
that L Chistovich took a walk with me alone may wel. have been the reason
she was placed under house arrest.
