1. Transmitted under separate cover truename attachments are the
following forms to complete Headquarters' records on subject:
a. Personal History Statement
b. Personai history Suate...cat (Appendix I)
c. Report of Medical History
2. Subject was originally recruited as a cutout for the LIHUFF/2
organization. However, his actual duties for KUBARK entail far more than
contact and communication with LIHUFF/2. He is an outside agent. In
addition to acting as the contact between the Mexico Station and the LIHUFF/2
Institute, LIHUFF/l is responsible for organizing and directing the KUWOLF
student groups in the LIHUFF/2 project; printing and distributing of propaganda;
planning and initiating student harrassn.ent activities. Since LIHUFF,1's
duties are those of an outside agent is salary was established to reimburse
him for the amount of tince it is necessary for him to spend on LIHUFF
activities. In this regard, it is felt that the sum of $500. monthly is not an
excessive amount. Headquarters is requested to process a contract for
subject in this amount.
3. Subject's social security number is 255-58-5834
