AURA OF UNREST AND DISCONTENT PERSISTS BENEATH SURFACE.
MOST SIGNIFICANT PSYCHOLOGICAL REACTION UNDERSTANDABLY
TAKING PLACE AMONG BUSINESS COMMUNITY (US, VIETNAMESE, CHINESE
AND OTHER FOREIGN BUSINESSMEN) IN SAIGON/CHOLON AREA. WE HAVE
RECEIVED INCREASING NUMBER REPORTS BUSINESSMEN WORRIED OVER

SHARPLY OTHER BUSINESSMEN SEEKING UNLOAD LARGE SUMS PIASTERS

RETURN (SEE EMBTEL 715 PARAGRAPH 7). COMMODITIES AND RELATED
TRADES PRIMARILY AFFECTED ARE SUGAR FLOUR, CONDENSED MILK,
AND CEMENT. WHILE REPORTS STILL SOMEWHAT CONFLICTING, CONCERN
IN BUSINESS COMMUNITY, AND TO CERTAIN EXTENT IN GENERAL PUBLIC,
