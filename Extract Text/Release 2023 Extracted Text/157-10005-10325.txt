Dear Walt:
'Tis the time of year to put all things aright. In this
spirit let me run through a list of unrequited bits and pieces.
Would you be so kind as to provide the Committee with the
following:
1) A statement on the relationship of Humphrey Evans to the
Agency. Humphrey Evans is the author of The Thought
Revolution and Escape from Red China. Could you also
provide us with information and/or files on Tung Chi-Ping
and Robert Loh. These two men were the subject of
Humphrey's books.
2) Access to the files on the Vietnam Council on Foreign
Relations. We would like to know the relationship, if
any, of the Agency to the Council including whatever
assistance the U.S. government may have provided to the
publication and distribution of the Viet Nam Magazine.
3) A statement from the Central Intelligence Agency on the
actual intelligence value of the information provided by
Penkovsky. What did he tell the U.S. government that heit
didn't know? How valuable was that information? What
difference did it make?
4) Information on or access to the files on Lem Jones Associates,
Inc., of 280 Madison Avenue, New York, New York. This
firm released the various bulletins of the Cuban Revolu-
tionary Council in the 1960's.
