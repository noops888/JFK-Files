SUBJECT
: Notification of Approval of Quality Step
Increase
Farba Flick
1. I am pleased to send to you the attached official
notification of the approval of the Quality Step Increase
which you recommended for this employee.
2. The salary increase accomplished by the award of
a Quality Step Increase is important and tangible evidence
of the esteem in which the employee so recognized is held.
liowever, I believe the commendatory and incentivo benefits
of this award will be partially lost unless it is presented
in an appropriate ceremony which will afford the individual
recognition among co-workers and supervisory officials. Also,
I believe such recognition serves to inspire other employees
to aspire to earning such recognition.
3. Acknowledging that cover problems nay severely
limit the manner in which this notice is presented to the
employee concerned, may I ask that you arrange to have it
presented with such ceremony as is appropriate to his status
and assignment.
