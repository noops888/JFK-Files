Florida, Telephone Number 305-391-0489, Business Telephone

correspondent for the "National Enquirer".
DUFFY wanted to know what investigation, if any,
the Bureau conducted on a JEAN SOUETRE, also known as MICHEL
ROUX, MICHEL HERTZ, who was supposedly located in Dallas,
Texas, on 11/22/63, the day President KENNEDY was assassinated.

DUFFY had in his possession a very poor quality
Xerox-type copy of what he claims to be a Government document
that was obtained via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
request from some Government agency. DUFFY claims he does
not know from what Government agency this document originated.
This copy was furnished to him by the "National Enquirer" to
check out in an effort to determine the background on SOUETRE,
aka and why such a dangerous man was in Dallas, Texas, on
11/22/63. DUFFY is pursuing the possibility that SOUETRE
was an assassin in Dallas, Texas, on 11/22/63, and might have
been responsible for the assassination of President KENNEDY.
The copy of the one page document that DUFFY had
in his possession was of insufficient quality to legibly
Xerox, but upon close visual examination, it was determined
that the document contained the following information:
"1 Apr 64

Houston, Texas. Subject is believed to be
identical with a Captain who is a deserter from
the French Army and an activist in the OAS.
The French are concerned because of DeGaulle's
planned visit to Mexico. They would like to
know the reason for his expulsion from the US
and his destination. Bureau files are negative

the following:

DUFFY made an oral request to determine if he
could obtain any information on SOUETRE, aka from the FBI
pursuant to the FOIA. The provisions of the FOIA were
explained to DUFFY, but he seemed to be only interested in
obtaining any information he could on an immediate basis.
DUFFY made no written request for information under FOIA
and no information was furnished to him from Bureau files.
For the information of the Bureau, reference
