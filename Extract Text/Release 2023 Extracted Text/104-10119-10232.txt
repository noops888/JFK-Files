2. The enclosed information is furnished as an aid in deter-
mining whether or not the Subject should be used in the proposed
capacity.
3. During recent investigation of Subject, certain information
was developed which appears to reflect adversely upon his character,
professional activities and associates. This information, in addition
to checks of the Office of Security indices, is summarized as follows:
a.. Three developed informants commented favorably regarding
Subject's character, reputation and loyalty but one one informant stated
that Subject had been married three times and his present marriage almost
ended in divorce recently.
:..
b. Subject was fined $45 for a 1954 traffic violation and
his subsequent failure to appear at the hearing. One informant advised
Subject had recently been the object of inquiries by local police officers.
The informant believed this action resulted from unpaid parking tickets.
c. Subject's name appears numerous times in subversive files
on the West Coast. These items contain information about Subject's
activities in the Democratic Minority Conference and liste his pro-
fessional associates. In 1949 he was listed as a member of the Bar
committee against loyalty oaths for lawyers. He was shown as a close
associate of Vaito SPENCER, described by the files as a leftist, and
his activities were primarily concerned with local minor. ty groups.
These activities were extensively reported in the Communist Daily People's
BWorld.

front activities in California over the years.
e. The Subject reportedly assisted Ralph H. HUTTER during the
trial of Anthony P. RIOS and Alfred ULLOA, nembers of the Cammity Sar-
vice Organization. NUTTER, according to Security Office indices, was a
close personal friend of Harrison Scott DROWN, security disapproved in 1955,
and favorably recommended him. NUTTER is also shown as a member of the
Los Angeles County Conference on Committee Relations (LACCR) as of October
1953. Mis organization, although not regarded as Communist-dominated,
sticks close to the Communist line and has spoken out against Los Angeles
Police Department brutality, teacher firing, loyalty oaths, book-burning
and witch-hunting by HCUA, thought control and UNESCO. NUTTER was also a
member of the Community Service Organization, which was regarded as infil-
trated by the Communist Party in 1954-55 and is influenced but not dominated
by the Party at the present time.
f. In January 1959, the Subject was interviewed by a representa-
tive of the OSI concerning his association with Reinhold Josuha WULF, con-
