SOURCE AN AMERICAN OBSERVER (B); FROM PRESIDENT DIEM.
APPR. IT IS PROBABLY TRUE THAT PRESIDENT DIEM HOLDS THE VIEWS EXPRESSED, AND THAT HE KNEW
THAT THEY WOULD REACH AMERICAN OFFICIALS.
1.
PRESIDENT NGO DINH DIEM STATED ON 14 NOVEMBER 1962 THAT THE FRENCH WERE
ATTEMPTING TO MAINTAIN THEIR CONTROL IN SOUTHEAST ASIA BY THE NEUTRALIZATION OF
THE AREA AND BY THE DIMINUTION OR EJECTION OF SIGNIFICANT AMERICAN PRESENCE. DIEM
STATED THAT SUCH IS HAPPENING IN LAOS: AND WHAT IS UNDER WAY IN CAMBODIA, WITH THE
POSSIBLE FORCED WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED STATES MILITARY ASSISTANCE AND ADVISORY
GROUP THERE. THE UNITED STATES WILL DISCOVER THAT THE FRENCH ARE INCAPABLE OF
DISCHARGING THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES EITHER IN LAOS OR IN CAMBODIA. FRENCH JURISTS
ARE DRAWING UP THE NEUTRALIZATION PROPOSAL IN PHNOM PENH, DIEM REMARKED.

:
TO IMPOSE IN LAOS A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM CHARACTERISTIC OF THE OLD AND ESTABLISHED
COUNTRIES OF WESTERN EUROPE, AND EVEN MORE CHARACTERISTIC OF THOSE COUNTRIES AT
THE END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. ALL OF THE LAO ARMED FORCES ARE NOT
COMPLETELY LACKING IN FIGHTING SPIRIT, DIEM STATED, BUT CHANGING AMERICAN
POLICIES IN LAOS HAVE TENDED TO DEMORALIZE THE Láº O FORCES AND DESTROY THEIR
::
SPIRIT. DIEM SAID THAT THAILAND STILL HAS SEVERAL COURSES OF POSSIBLE ACTION
CONCERNING LAOS, FOR INSTANCE, THAILAND COULD DENY RICE SUPPLIES AND CUT OFF
ACCESS FOR OTHER IMPORTS INTO LAOS. THAILAND SHOULD HAVE INVADED LAOS AT THE
BEGINNING OF THE SOVIET AIRLIFT, AND SHOULD HAVE WITHDRAWN STEP BY STEP IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE TROOPS FROM NORTH VIETNAM. COMMUNIST
CHINA MAY HAVE STARTED THE LAO VENTURE IN ORDER TO CONSOLIDATE PHONG SALY, SAM
NEUA, AND NORTHERN LAOS IN GENERAL, AS A PROTECTION FOR YUNNAN PROVINCE, WHICH
DIEM DESCRIBED AS ONE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE AREAS ON MAINLAND CHINA. DIEM.
BELIEVED THE CHINESE NATIONALISTS SHOULD DIRECT PROBING ACTIONS INTO SUCH AREAS
AS YUNNAN, INSTEAD OF CONDUCTING THEM FRONTALLY AGAINST THE COASTAL AREAS.
