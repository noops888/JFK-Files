MEMORANDUM FOR: Special Assistant, DDS&T
SUBJECT
:
Request from House Select Committee on Assassinations
1. (U) In response to your request of 26 July 1978, we have lo-
cated two coverages of Mexico City. The first is an unclassified air-
craft mapping mission taken on 8 February 1967. This coverage is
clear, large scale, 9 x 9 format imagery which covers all of Mexico
City proper. However, this coverage will not hold up to magnification.
We have in our possession 49 frames of a duplicate positive of this
imagery.
2. (TSR) Also, we have found that there is good quality KH-9
imagery taken on 10 March 1973. This consists of two frames of dupli-
cate positive imagery.
3. (U) Please let us know what disposition you would like us to
make of this imagery. We can either send copies to you or have someone
look at it here.
