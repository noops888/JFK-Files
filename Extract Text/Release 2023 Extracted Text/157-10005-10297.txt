contaminated diving suit* (Colby, 5/21, pp. 38-39).
The Inspector General's Report dates this
operation in January 1963, when Fitzgerald replaced Harvey as
Chief of Task Force W, although it is unclear whether Harvey or
Fitzgerald conceived of the plan (I.G., p. 75). It is likely
that the activity took place earlier, since Donovan had completed
his negotiations by the middle of January 1963. Helms characterized
the plan as "cockeyed" (Helms, 6/13, p. 135).
TSD bought a diving suit, dusted the inside
29
with a fungus that would produce a chronic skin disease (Madura
foot), and contaminated the breathing apparatus with a tubercule
bacillus (I.G., p. 75). The Inspector General's Report states
that the plan was abandoned because Donovan gave Castro a different
diving suit on his own initiative (I.G., p. 75). Helms testified
that the diving suit never left the laboratory (Helms, 6/13, p. 135).

In March 1961, an officer of the Mexico

that B-l had given AMLASH-1 a silencer and that AMLASH-1 had
"small, highly concentrated explosives." On February 11, 1965

the Madrila Station cabled that AMLASH-1 would soon receive "one
pistol with silencer and one FAL rifle with a silencer from B-l's
secretary" (I.G., p. 103). A subsequent cable reported that
"B-1 had three packages of special items made up by his technical
people and delivered to AMLASH-1 in Madrid" (I.G., p. 103

Introduction
The Committee has received solid evidence of a CIA
plot to assassinate Patrice Lumumba. The plot proceeded to
the point where lethal substances and instruments specifically
intended for use in an assassination were placed in the hands
of the CIA Chief of Station in Leopoldville by an Agency
scientist.
Although these instruments of assassination were never
used, a number of questions are presented by the Lumumba case
which reflect general issues that run throughout the Committee's
assassination inquiry. First, did CIA officers and operatives
in the Congo take steps to attempt the assassination of Lumumba?
Second, how high in the United States government was the
source of authorization for the CIA assassination plot? Finally,
was the CIA connected in any way to the events that actually led
to the death of Lumumba while in Congolese custody?
A thread of historical background is necessary to weave these
broad questions together with the documents and testimony re-
ceived by the Committee.

Stanleyville, and he was imprisoned.
The central government of
the Congo transferred Lumumba on January 17, 1961 to the custody
of authorities in the province of Katanga, which was asserting its
own independence at that time.
Several weeks later, the Katangese
authorities announced Lumumba's death.
There are various accounts of the circumstances and timing
of Lumumba's death. The United Nations investigation of the inci-
dent concluded that Lumumba was killed on January 17.*
2. Dulles Cables Leopoldville That "Removal" of Lumumba
is an Urgent Objective in "High Quarters'

Shortly after the Congolese declaration of independence
from Belgium on June 30, 1960, the CIA assigned a new Chief of
Station to the Congo. The Chief of Station said that the briefings
he received at CIA headquarters in preparation for his departure
contained no discussion of the possibility of assassinating Patrice
Lumumba (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 8). On his brief return to head-
quarters in connection with Lumumba's visit to Washington in late
July, the Chief of Station again heard no discussion of assassi-
nating Lumumba (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 9).
During August, great concern about Lumumba's political
strength in the Congo was growing among the foreign policy-makers
of the Eisenhower Administration.** This concern was nurtured

by intelligence reports such as that cabled to CIA headquarters
by the new Chief of Station:

WEST FORCES RAPIDLY INCREASING POWER CONGO AND
THERE MAY BE LITTLE TIME LEFT IN WHICH TAKE ACTION
TO AVOID ANOTHER CUBA.... (CIA Cable (IN 39706,
Leopoldville to Director, 8/18/60.)
39709,
This cable also stated the Chief of Station's operational "OBJECTIVE
[OF] REPLACING LUMUMBA WITH PRO WESTERN GROUP" (CIA Cable, 8/18/60).
Bronson Tweedy, then Chief of the Africa Division of CIA's clan-
destine services, replied the same day that he was seeking State
Department approval for the proposed operation based upon "OUR
BELIEF LUMUMBA MUST BE REMOVED IF POSSIBLE" (CIA Cable (Out
Tweedy to Leopoldville, 8/18/60). On August 19, Richard Bissell,
Director of CIA's covert operations branch, signed a follow-up
cable to Leopoldville: "YOU ARE AUTHORIZED PROCEED WITH OPERATION"
(CIA Cable OUT 59959, Director to Leopoldville, 8/19/60).
Several days later, the Chief of Station reported that a plan
to assassinate Lumumba had been proposed to President Kasavubu by
Congolese leaders:
ANTI-LUMUMBA LEADERS APPROACHED KASAVUBU
WITH PLAN ASSASSINATE LUMUMBA
KASAVUBU

(Out 59741),

The next day, Allen Dulles personally signed a cable* to
the Leopoldville Chief of Station which stressed the urgency of
"removing" Lumumba:
IN HIGH QUARTERS** HERE IT IS THE CLEAR-
CUT CONCLUSION THAT IF LLL (LUMUMBA] CON-
TINUES TO HOLD HIGH OFFICE, THE INEVITABLE
RESULT WILL AT BEST BE CHAOS AND AT WORST
PAVE THE WAY TO COMMUNIST TAKEOVER OF THE
CONGO WITH DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE
PRESTIGE OF THE UN AND FOR THE INTERESTS OF
THE FREE WORLD GENERALLY. CONSEQUENTLY
WE CONCLUDE THAT HIS REMOVAL MUST BE AN
URGENT AND PRIME OBJECTIVE THAT UNDER EXISTING
CONDITIONS THIS SHOULD BE A HIGH, PRIORITY OF
OUR COVERT ACTION. (CIA Cable, COUT 62966),
Director to Leopoldville, 8/26/60.)
Dulles cabled that the Chief of Station was to be given "WIDER
AUTHORITY" along the lines of the previously authorized opera-
tion to replace Lumumba with a pro-Western group -- "INCLUDING
EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVE ACTION IF IT CAN REMAIN COVERT" (CIA Cable,
8/26/60). "WE REALIZE THAT TARGETS OF OPPORTUNITY MAY PRESENT
THEMSELVES TO YOU," the cable continued (CIA Cable, 8/26/60).
* Cables issued under the personal signature of the DCI are
a relative rarity in CIA communitations and call attention to the
importance and sensitivity of the matter discussed.
** As discussed in Section 5(c), infra, Richard Bisell testified
that Allen Dulles would have used the phrase "higher quarters" to
refer to the President (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 48)..
NW 50955 DocId:32202487 Page 11
-7-
Dulles also authorized the expenditure of up to $100,000 "ΤΟ
CARRY OUT ANY CRASH PROGRAMS ON WHICH YOU DO NOT HAVE THE OPPOR-
TUNITY TO CONSULT HQS" (CIA Cable, 8/26/60). He assured the
Chief of Station that the message had been "SEEN AND APPROVED AT
COMPETENT LEVEL" in the State Department (CIA Cable, 8/26/60).
But the Director of Central Intelligence made a special point
of assuring the Chief of Station that he was authorized to act
unilaterally in a case where the United States Ambassador to the
Congo would prefer to remain uninformed:
TO THE EXTENT THAT AMBASSADOR MAY DESIRE
TO BE CONSULTED, YOU SHOULD SEEK. HIS CON-
CURRENCE. IF IN ANY PARTICULAR CASE, НЕ
DOES NOT WISH TO BE CONSULTED YOU CAN ACT
ON YOUR OWN AUTHORITY WHERE TIME DOES NOT
PERMIT REFERRAL HERE (CIA Cable, 8/26/60).
This mandate raises a question as to whether the DCI was contem-
plating a particular form of action against Lumumba which the
Ambassador would want to be in a position to "plausibly deny"
United States involvement. DDP Richard Bissell testified that he
was "almost certain" that he was informed about the Dulles cable
shortly after its transmission and that it was his "belief" that
the cable was a circumlocutious means of indicating that the
President wanted Lumumba to be killed (Bissell, 9/10/75, pp. 33,
64-65).*
* See Section 5(c), infra, for additional testimony by Bissell
on the question of authorization for the assassination effort
against Lumumba.
NW 50955 DocId: 32202487 Page 12

to a remark by the Chief of Station that implied that he might
assassinate Lumumba:
TO COS COMMENT THAT LUMUMBA IN OPPOSITION IS
ALMOST AS DANGEROUS AS IN OFFICE, [THE
CONGOLESE POLITICIAN) INDICATED UNDERSTOOD
AND IMPLIED MIGHT PHYSICALLY ELIMINATE
LUMUMBA. (CIA Cable, (IN 49679) Leopoldville
to Director, 9/7/60.)
The cable continued to report that the Chief of Station had offered
to assist this politician "IN PREPARATION NEW GOVERNMENT PROGRAM"
and assured him that the United States would supply technicians
(CIA Cable, 9/7/60).
As the chaotic struggle for power raged, the Chief of
the Africa Division succinctly summarized the prevalent U. S.
apprehension about Lumumba's ability to influence events in the
Congo by virtue of personality, irrespective of his official
position:
LUMUMBA TALENTS AND DYNAMISM APPEAR OVER-
RIDING FACTOR IN REESTABLISHING HIS POSITION
EACH TIME IT SEEMS HALF LOST. IN OTHER WORDS
EACH TIME LUMUMBA HAS OPPORTUNITY HAVE LAST
WORD HE CAN SWAY EVENTS TO HIS ADVANTAGE.
(CIA Cable, (OUT 69233) Director to Leopoldville,
9/13/60).
Estet
The day after Mobutu's coup, the Chief of Station reported
that he was serving as an advisor to a Congolese effort to "elimi-
nate" Lumumba due to his "fear" that Lumumba might, in fact, have
been strengthened by placing himself in UN custody, which afforded
a safe base of operations:

(CIA Cable, (IN 13374) Leopoldville to Director,
9/15/60.)
On September 17, another CIA operative in the Congo met
with a leading Congolese senator. At this meeting, the senator
requested a clandestine supply of small arms to equip some
Congolese Army troops. The cable to CIA headquarters concerning
the meeting reported:
TROOPS

POSSIBILITY OBTAINING ARMS" and recommended to CIA headquarters
that they should
HAVE [ARMS) SUPPLIES READY TO GO AT

DECISION THAT SUPPLY WARRANTED AND NECES-
SARY (CIA Cable, 9/17/60).*
* This recommendation proved to be in line with large scale
planning at CIA headquarters for clandestine paramilitary support
to anti-Lumumba elements.
On October 6, 1960, Richard Bissell and
Bronson Tweedy signed a cable concerning plans which the Chief of
Station was instructed not to discuss with State Department repre-
sentatives or operational contacts:

Several days later, while warning a key Congolese
leader about coup plots led by Lumumba and two of his supporters,
the Chief of Station
URGED ARREST OR OTHER MORE PERMANENT DISPOSAL
OF LUMUMBA, GIZENGA, AND MULELE (CIA Cable,

4. The Plot to Assassinate Lumumba
In the fall of 1960, a scientist from CIA headquarters
delivered to the Chief of Station in Leopoldville lethal bio-
logical substances to be used to assassinate Patrice Lumumba.
The Chief of Station testified that after requesting and receiving
confirmation from CIA headquarters that he was to carry out the
scientist's instructions, he proceeded to take "exploratory steps"
in furtherance of the assassination plot. The Chief of Station
testified that in the course of his discussion with the CIA
scientist, Sidney Gottlieb, he was informed that President Eisenhower
had ordered the assassination mission against Patrice Lumumba.
Gottlieb's mission to the Congo was both preceded and followed by
general cables urging the "elimination" of Lumumba sent from CIA
headquarters in an extraordinarily restricted "Eves Only" channel
including two messages under the personal signature of Allen Dulles.
The lethal substances were never used by the Chief of
Station. But despite the fact that Lumumba had placed himself in
the protective custody of the UN peace-keeping force shortly
before the poisons were delivered to the Chief of Station, there
is no clear evidence that the assassination operation was termi-
nated before Lumumba's death. There is, however, no direct evidence
of a connection between the CIA assassination plot and the events
which actually led to Lumumba's death.*
* See Section 6, infra, for a discussion of the evidence about
the circumstances that led to Lumumba's death in Katanga.

(a)
Dulles Cables Again for "Elimination" of Lumumba,
and a Messenger is Sent to Congo With a Highly
Sensitive Assignment
On September 19, 1960, several days after Lumumba placed him-
self in the protective custody of the United Nations peacekeeping
force in Leopoldville, Richard Bissell and Bronson Tweedy signed
a cryptic cable to Leopoldville to arrange a clandestine meeting
between the Chief of Station and "Sidney) Braun," who was traveling
to the Congo on an unspecified assignment:
["SID"] SHOULD ARRIVE, APPROX 27 SEPT.
WILL
ANNOUNCE HIMSELF AS "(SID) FROM PARIS".
URGENT YOU SHOULD SEE ('(SID") SOONEST POSSIBLE
AFTER HE PHONES YOU. HE WILL FULLY IDENTIFY
HIMSELF AND EXPLAIN HIS ASSIGNMENT TO YOU.
(CIA Cable, OUT 71464) Bissell/Tweedy to Chief
of Station, 9/19/60.)
The cable bore a highly unusual sensitivity indicator --
"PROP" -- that restricted circulation at CIA headquarters to the
Chief of the Africa Division.*
*
In a letter of September 23, 1975, the Chief of the CIA Review
Staff informed the Committee that "PROP" was normally used "to
denote sensitive personnel matters" (Seymour R. Bolton to Frederick
A. O. Schwarz and Frederick D. Baron, 9/23/75. It appears that this
sensitivity indicator, while created for other purposes, was utilized
by Bissell, Tweedy, and the Chief of Station to restrict distribution
of their communications about an assassination operation. The cable
traffic cited in this report that was sent through the PROP channel
did not touch upon personnel matters except in terms of recruiting
additional CIA officers and agents for the assassination operation.
NW 50955 DocId: 32202487 Page 17
-16-
The Bissell/Tweedy cable informed the Chief of Station that
he was to continue to use this indicator for
ALL (CABLE) TRAFFIC THIS OP, WHICH YOU
INSTRUCTED HOLD ENTIRELY TO YOURSELF.
(CIA Cable, 9/19/60.)
The Chief of Station -- referred to herein as "Hedgman"* --
testified to a clear, independent recollection of receiving such
a cable. Hedgman stated that in September of 1960 he received a
"most unusual" cable from CIA headquarters (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 11,
43). The cable advised, in his words, that:
someone who I would have recognized would
arrive with instructions for me...
I
believe the message was also marked for my
eyes only
and contained instructions
that I was not to discuss the message with
anyone. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 12-13.)
...
Hedgman said that the cable did not specify the kind of instruc-
tions he was to receive, and it "did not refer to Lumumba in any
way" (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 12).
Three days after the Bissell/Tweedy message that Hedgman was
to meet "Sid" in Leopoldville, Bronson Tweedy uses the same sensi-
tivity indicator on a cable sent to Hedgman on an "Eyes Only"
basis (CIA Cable, OUT 74837, Tweedy to Leopoldville, 9/22/60).
(OUT 74837.) Twe
* Due to fear of reprisal from Lumumba's followers, the Chief
of Station for the Congo from mid-summer 1960 through 1961 testi-
fied under the alias "Hedgman" (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 2; 8/25/75,
p. 4).
NW 50955 DocId:32202487 Page 18
-17-
Tweedy's cable indicated that a third country national would be
required as an agent in the PROP operation:
IF DECIDED SUPPORT FOR PROP OBJECTIVES,
BELIEVE ESSENTIAL SUCH BE PROVIDED THROUGH
THIRD NATIONAL CHANNEL WITH [AMERICAN]
ROLE COMPLETELY CONCEALED. (CIA Cable,
9/22/60.)
Tweedy expressed reservations about two agents that the station
was using for other operations and said "WE ARE CONSIDERING A
THIRD NATIONAL CUTOUT CONTACT CANDIDATE AVAILABLE HERE WHO MIGHT
FILL BILL" (CIA Cable, 9/22/60). Despite Tweedy's concern about
the two existing station contacts, he indicated that the Chief of
station and his "colleague" -- presumably the man identified as
("id") who was to arrive in the Congo shortly to explain the PROP
operation to Hedgman -- were to be afforded considerable latitude
in exercising their judgment on the conduct of the operation:
YOU AND COLLEAGUE UNDERSTAND WE CANNOT READ
OVER YOUR SHOULDER AS YOU PLAN AND ASSESS
OPPORTUNITIES. OUR PRIMARY CONCERN MUST BE
CONCEALMENT (AMERICAN) ROLE, UNLESS OUT-
STANDING OPPORTUNITY EMERGES WHICH MAKES
CALCULATED RISK FIRST CLASS BET. READY

BASED OUR HIGH REGARD BOTH YOUR PROFESSIONAL
JUDGMENTS. (CIA Cable, 9/22/60.)
* This is probably a reference to agent QJWIN, who was later
dispatched to the Congo. His mission is discussed in Sections
and
infra.
NW 50955 DocId: 32202487 Page 19

On September 24, Allen Dulles personally issued a cable to
Leopoldville expressing in absolute terms his desire to "eliminate"
Lumumba:
WE WISH GIVE EVERY POSSIBLE SUPPORT IN
ELIMINATING LUMUMBA FROM ANY POSSIBILITY
RESUMING GOVERNMENTAL POSITION OR IF HE
FAILS IN LEOP (OLDVILLE), SETTING HIMSELF
IN STANLEYVILLE OR ELSEWHERE. (CIA Cable,
OUT 73573), Dulles to Leopoldville, 9/24/60.)
Dulles had expressed a similar view three days before in the
presence of the President at an NSC meeting, stating:
Mobutu appeared to be the effective power in
the Congo for the moment but Lumumba was not
yet disposed of and remained a grave danger
as long as he was not disposed of. (NSC
Minutes, 9/21/60)
(b) (Gottlieb) Delivers Lethal Substances to the Chief of
Station in the Congo for the Assassination of Lumumba
(IN 18989),
The Chief of Station reported through the PROP channel to Bronson
Tweedy that he had made contact with the man dispatched to Leopoldville
with a highly sensitive assignment on September 26. (CIA Cable
18989), Leopoldville to Tweedy, 9/27/60) This was the same
week in which Dulles cabled about the "elimination" of Lumumba
and made his statement to the NSC about the "grave danger" that
existed as long as Lumumba was not "disposed of".
Hedgman testified about the identity of "SID" -- the messenger
referred to in the first cable through the PROP channel:
Q: Who was the messenger who arrived?
Hedgman: Mr. (Sidney Gottlieb
NW 50955 DocId:32202487 Page 20
158
-19
Q: And at that time, you knew who he was?
Hedgman, I recognized him as an officer of the
Agency
I believe he referred to the
fact that I had received a message and that he
was the person concerned.
(Hedgman, 8/21/75,
pp. 15-16)
The message carried by (Gottlieb, then Science Advisor to
DDP Richard Bissell,) was unmistakeably clear according to Hedgman:
Hedgman: It is my recollection that he advised me, or
my instructions were, to eliminate Lumumba.
Q: By eliminate, do you mean assassinate?
Hedgman: Yes. I would say that was
my under-
standing of the primary means. I don't think it was
probably limited to that, if there was some other way
of doing it.
Q:. Of doing what?
Hedgman: Of removing him from a position of political
threat. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 17-18.)
Hedgman said that he and Gottlieb also may have discussed non-
lethal means of removing Lumumba as a "political threat", but
he said, "I cannot recall with certainty on that" (Hedgman,
8/21/75, p. 28).
He clearly recalled the discussion of assassination,
however:
Q:
And what did Mr. Gottlieb indicate with regard to
the possibility of physically eliminating him?
Hedgman: It was my understanding that that was
probably expected of me.
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 18.)
And again:
Q: I take it that once you started discussing these
lethal agents, there was no doubt in your mind that
the kind of elimination he was there particularly to
discuss was killing Lumumba?
