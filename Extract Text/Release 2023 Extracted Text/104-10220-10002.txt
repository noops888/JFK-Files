2. Your attention is directed to information available to
your office located in RI file $200-7-32-66 which is the result of
FEI investigation dated 26 October 1948 under Subject's name.
short, this file reflects information regarding Subject's interest
in, sympathy for, and recruitment by the Jewish Zionist movement.
Kis recruitment as a fighter pilot and undercover men in Palestine
was terminated on 12 May 1948 due to the fact that he was arrested
on the Sullivan Act in New York City on that date. Additionally,
RI file #201-1424 contains PPI reports dated in 1950 and 1951 wherein
cuestionable information regarding Subject's activities and mental
competence is set forth.
3. In view of the information set forth above, a Provisional
Covert Security Approval cannot be granted prior to completion of
extensive inquiries in this case. In light of the highly questionable
information as set forth in RI sources, it is requested that the
interested division give due consideration to the feasibility of
continuing interest in retaining Subject's services.
4. Pending your advice as to the continuance of the division's
interest in this case, no further action is contemplated by this
office.
