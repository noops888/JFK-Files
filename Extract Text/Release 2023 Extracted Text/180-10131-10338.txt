actually giving you the transcript to keep we would like to ask
you to waive that right.

For the record that correspondence with
JFK Exhibit 94 at the JFK hearings.
My name is Michael Goldsmith. I am staff counsel with
the Committee and I am authorized by the Committee to take your
statement for this deposition. For backgroun purposes I would
like to tell you what the mandate of the Committee is and that
is to investigate the assassination of President Kennedy,
specifically who did it, was there a conspiracy, and also to
evaluate the performance of the investigative agencies includ-
ing the FBI and the CIA.
Finally, another aspect of the mandate of the Committee
is to evaluate the work done by the Warren Commission. Do you
understand that?
Mrs. Scaletti. I do.
Prior to coming here today have you had
13
Mr. Goldsmith.
24
any discussion with any present or former employee of the CIA
25
concerning your testimony that you are about to give today?
NW 50955 DocId:32277223 Page 7

Mrs. Scaletti. I went to the Agency, to the office of
General Counsel to find out what my rights were, what restric-
tions were placed on me. They told me I had no restrictions
placed on me and I could have counsel with me today if I
wanted to.
Mr. Goldsmith. Did anyone in the Agency discuss the
substance of the testimony with you?
Mrs. Scaletti. No. I discussed with him only they
did not discuss with me what I should say or in any way I could
say it.
Mr. Goldsmith.
Have you spoken to ant present or former
Agency employee about testimony or statements which those
persons have given to the Committee in the past?
Mrs. Scaletti. No, I have not.
Mr. Goldsmith.
Is it fair to say that other than the
interview you had previously with staff members of this Commit-
tee you have not discussed the substance of this case with any-
one?
Mrs. Scaletti. No. Just OGC and OLC about my rights
and procedures, et cetera.
Mr. Goldsmith.
Mrs. Scaletti, for how many years were
you employed by the CIA?
Mrs. Scaletti. Twenty-six plus.
Mr. Goldsmith. What years were you working for the
Agency?

Mrs. Scaletti. 1951 to
I retired December 1977.
Mr. Goldsmith.
Would you give us a brief summary of the
positions that you held during that 26 years?
Mrs. Scaletti. I started as a typist and I retired as a
Branch Chief. I went all the positions in between, reports,
6
IA.
7
Mr. Goldsmith. IA stands for what? A
3
Mrs. Scaletti.
Intelligence Assistant officer, Chief of
9
Station, Branch Chief, Deputy Branch Chief.
10
Mr. Goldsmith.
Where were you Cheif of Station?
11
Mrs. Scaletti.
Porttof Spain, Trinidad.
12
Mr. Goldsmith.
When you retired you were Chief of which
13
branch?
14
Mrs. Scaletti.
It was over Venezuela, Colombia, Equador.
15
Mr. Goldsmith. One of the branches in the Western
16
Hemisphere?
17
Mrs. Scaletti.
A Western Hemisphere Branch.
13
Mr. Goldsmith.
Did you ever have any experience as a case
19
officer dealing with agents in the field?
20
Mrs. Scaletti.
Yes.
2.1
Mr. Goldsmith.
In 1963 where were you assigned?
22
Mrs. Scaletti.
Washington.
23
Mr. Goldsmith.
What was your responsibility at that time?
24
Mrs. Scaletti. I was on the Mexican desk or branch.
25
Mr. Goldsmith. My understanding is that a desk would be
001715
NW 50955 DocId:32277223 Page 9
TOP SECRET
:
7
a subunit of a branch, is that correct?
2
Right.
Mrs. Scaletti.
Mr. Goldsmith. So if you were assigned to the Mexican
desk that would be one of the desks in the Western Hemisphere,
in a particular Western Hemisphere Branch?
Mrs. Scaletti. Right, unless it became a branch all by
itself. This is just internal organization, reo-ganization.
It does not mean anything.
Mr. Goldsmith. In 1963 how many years had you been work-
ing on the Mexican Desk?
Mrs. Scaletti. I don't remember unless I get my chron-
ology but I would say at least, to be honest, I don't remember
but I think it is at least three or four. I just don't remember..
Mr. Goldsmith. How many years did you stay at the Mexican
Disk before going on to your next assignment?
Mrs. Scaletti. From there I went to Mexico in 1967.
Mr. Goldsmith. In 1967 you actually went to Mexico?
Mrs. Scaletti. Yes.
Mr. Goldsmith. As a case officer?
Mrs. Scaletti.
No, as an IA.
Mr. Goldsmith.
During that time did you work under Win
Scott?
Mrs. Scaletti.
In Mexico?
Mr. Goldsmith.
Yes.
Mrs. Scaletti.
In Mexico, yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. While in Mexico did you ever work with
Ann Goodpasture?
Mrs. Scaletti. We worked with everybody in the station.
So, indirectly but not directly under her.
Mr. Goldsmith.
Do you know what here responsibilities
were at the station?
Mrs. Scaletti.
Broadly. She assisted Mr. Scott and
handled some of his cases. Ireally don't know what she had full
responsibility for. I know she assisted him on some of the
things that he handled.
Mr. Goldsmith.
Is it fair to say she was his right hand
person?
Mrs. Scaletti.
Not exactly because his right hand person
would have been the Deputy Chief of Station.
Mr. Goldsmith.
As a formal matter that would certainly
have been the case.
Informally did he rely on her a great deal?
Mrs. Scaletti.
Yes, but I wouldn't say that she was his
really right hand person. He did depend upon her but not for
everything.
Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know whether she had any responsi-
bility for the surveillance operations in Mexico City?
Mrs. Scaletti. That I can't remember. There was a lot
of coordination.
She would do some of the work but I don't
think she ran them and I don't remember she had the responsi-
bility for them.

to handle things at headquarters concerning Mexico and the
Mexico City station.
Mr. Goldsmith. Were the responsibilities of the Mexican
Desk solely administrative and procedureal in nature?
Mrs. Scaletti. The Mexican Desk was handled like any
other desk. If you say administrative and procedural includes
budget work, name traces, handling requests from Congress and
that is administrative and procedureal. But in my terminology
administrative can mean support and administration, which is
a completely different thing, like personnel or logistics, no.
Procedural, if you mean day to day answering of cables,
If you would like to elaborate on administrative or
procedural I might be able to
yes.
Mr. Goldsmith.
Could you give me a brief laundry list
of the types of work that the Mexican Desk did when it gave
support to the Mexico City station?
Mrs. Scaletti. In intelligence reporting it would
process the report, positive intelligence reports. It would
do the counterintelligence dissemination, if it were required,
to the FBI, et cetera. It would handle budget and submit
projects requesting money in support of the station's opera
tions. It would do name traces. It would handle requests from
NW 50955 DocId:32277223 Page 12
TOP SECRET
001718
10
Congress, requests from other government agencies.
We would
:

3
write any memo that was required in response to a request from
anybody, from the next echelon all the way up to the Director.
4
We would be responsible for replying to matters having to do
5
with Mexico per se or operations in Mexico.
Does that clarify
it?
7
Mr. Goldsmith. Yes, that is helpful.

12
Did the work involve at any time substantive analytical
work? In other words, you would get information from the
Mexico City station and you would then have to analyze that
information and perhaps make a policy decision on it?
10
13
14
15
16
.17
Mrs. Scaletti. No. At that time we are not analysts,
we only process raw material. Occasionally they might ask you
for a memo, like if there is an election, but we do not do
analytical work. We only put down facts that have been
reported. We do not do analysis. We do correlation.
a much better word.
That is
18
Mr. Goldsmith. What about actualy decisions?
If Mexico
19
City station communicated with the Mexican Desk and asked for
20
21
a decision to be made, would the Mexican Desk make the decision
or would someone else in the Branch make the decision?
22
Mrs. Scaletti. I think we misunderstood each other. When
23
you say policy, analytical, or intelligence, no, we did not
24
analyze intelligence. We only correlated. By policy you mean
25 operational policy?
NW 50955 DocId: 32277223 Page 13
TOP SECRET
001719
11
Mr. Goldsmith. Yes.
Mrs. Scaletti. On operations a lot is left to the
station to have a certain amount of autonomy. We had almost
no authority to make final decisions.
We could prepare a meassage with a recommendation and
then it would go for release or signature and at the time it
was released or the memo signed, that person would be making
a
the policy. Is that clear?
Mr. Goldsmith. Yes.
That person would be someone higher
up above the Mexican Desk?
Mrs. Scaletti. Yes.
Mr. Goldsmith. How many people worked on the Mexican
Desk?
Mrs. Scaletti. I cannot remember. I have been trying
to think. I cannot recall. I cannot remember where we were
sitting.
Mr. Goldsmith.
It was not just you?
Mrs. Scaletti.
I would say two or more, between two and
15.
Mr. Goldsmith.
When you say two or more are you thinking
in terms of case officers only or are you thinking in terms of
case officers, secretarial help, administrative help?
Mrs. Scaletti. Yes. I know where were at least two of
us because if I wasn't there, there had to be somebody else
there.
NW 50955 DocId:32277223 Page 14
TOP SECRET
001720
12
Mr. Goldsmith. You say two or more, you are not making
any distinction between case officer and other
Mrs. Scaletti. Don't stick me with the two. I know I
was there and somebody else must have been there. But how
many people were there -- there are tables of organization
available.
Honestly, I cannot remember. If I could visualize
what room I was sitting in then maybe I could try to think who
sat where but I cannot visualize where I was sitting at that
time.
Mr. Goldsmith. How many years did you work at the
Mexican Desk?
Mrs. Scaletti. We worked all over. Your table of
organization changes every four months or six months. Do you
understand? You said at that time? You said 1963?
Mr. Goldsmith.
Yes.
Mrs. Scaletti. I can remember at times temperararily
when there were 15 and I can remember times when Iwas practically
alone.
Mr. Goldsmith.
Who would have been your immediate
supervisor in 1963?
Mrs. Scaletti. I cannot remember who the Desk Chief was.
Mr. Goldsmith. Would the Desk Chief have been someone
different from the Branch Chief?
Mrs. Scaletti.
Yes, unless there was no Desk Chief. I
mean, if there was a vacancy.

13
Mr. Goldsmith. Did you ever work with Hack Whitten?
Mrs. Scaletti. Yes..
Mr. Goldsmith. Do you recall when you worked with him?
Mrs. Scaletti.
The Years I don't remember.
It was a
matter of a couple of years I believe.
Mr. Goldsmith.
Do you think that you worked with Whitten
in 1963?
Mrs. Scaletti.
I know I did because I saw a message.
Mr. Goldsmith.
In other words, you saw a cable of some
kind that had his name on it?
Mrs. Scaletti.
It was mine.
Mr. Goldsmith.
As a case officer working on the Mexican
Desk would you have been aware in 1963 of the various surveil-
lance operations that were in effect in Mexico City, being
conducted by the Mexico City station?
Mrs. Scaletti.
Not the surveillances but the team.
Mr. Goldsmith.
Could you elaborate a bit on that?
Mrs. Scaletti. I mean from the budget standpoint and from
the clearance of agents, I knew that there were so many teams
with about so many people, or basically what they did. But we
were not privy necessarily to what those people did every day.
Mr. Goldsmith. Did you know that there was a wire tap
operation against the Cuban and Soviet Embassies and Consulates?
Mrs. Scaletti.
Right.
Mr. Goldsmith. Did you also know there was a photo
001722
NW 50955 DocId:32277223 Page 16

14
surveillance operation against the Cuban Embassy and Consulate
2
and Soviet Embassy and Consulate?
3
Mrs. Scaletti.
Right.
Mr. Goldsmith.
If we can just clarify your last answer,
5
you were aware of the fact of these surveillance operations.
Could you explain to me again what you were not aware of?
Mrs. Scaletti. You know from your budget preparations
and from your handling of veryday traffic that you have certain
operations. Like, you know you have a surveillance team. That
is a project. You need so much money. You have so many people,
You have so many cars because they come in and request permis-
sion to buy a car or to sell a car. Or you know you have a
clearance fro so many people or this man quit, you know,
personnel. You
You know basically from the quarterly reporting or the
reporting that is required under the regulations, the general
target, because you have to get higher approval to hire a team
to do such and such.
But I do not know that on Monday, June 2nd, two cars went
to this house and looked at this window and Thursday
do you
understand?
Mr. Goldsmith. Yes. You would not be aware of the
operational information being picked up by the surveillance
operation?
Mrs. Scaletti. Unless the field bothered to tell you,
NW 50955 DocId:32277223 Page 17
TOP SECRET
001723
15
because they wanted to find something out or check something
out.
Mr. Goldsmith. How often would the field contact you
with regard to this types of situation?
Mrs. Scaletti. You could go a month or two without
having any, or longer.
Mr. Goldsmith. Would your answer to that question be
that you did not frequently get information from the Mexico
City station pertaining to the operational aspects of the
surveillance teams' work?
Mrs. Scaletti. Correct.
Mr. Goldsmith. When you did get this kind of information
would it come to headquarters from the Mexico City station by
means of a dispatch or cable?
Mrs. Scaletti.
Either one.
Mr. Goldsmith. How would it be determined which form
of communication would be used to contact headquarters?
Mrs. Scaletti. The priority and if a reply was requested,
because if you need an answer in order to do some more investi-
gation you had better send a cable or you are never going to
hear. If it is a dispatch it could take maybe a month by the
time you got to the desk and by the time you answer it it would
take a month.
Mr. Goldsmith. During the summer months, and I am talking
generally not just 1963, but during the summer months, at least
NW 50955 DocId:32277223 Page 18
TOP SECRET
001724
16
of the years you were at the Mexico Desk, do you recall
whether there were frequent communincations from the Mexico
City station reporting the fact of Americans visiting the
Embassy or Consulate of a communist country?
Mrs. Scaletti. I don't recall any difference between
summer months and any other months.
Mr. Goldsmith. When did Lee Harvey Oswald first come
to your attention?
Mrs. Scaletti.
When the station sent a cable asking
for a name trace, a routine name trace.
Mr. Goldsmith. At that time how important was the fact
of Oswald's contract considered?
Mrs. Scaletti.
It was a routine name trace.
Mr. Goldsmith.
So at that time it was not considered at
all unusual. Is that what you are saying?
Mrs. Scaletti. Yes. We handled it as any normal
because we would have gotten similar name traces on other
Americans who might have been identified as going to the Soviets.
It was a routine way of handling that for the Bureau.
Mr. Goldsmith. So even though the fact that Americans
did not frequently contact the Soviet Embassy or the Cuban
Embassy, when they did and Mexico City station communicated with
headquarters the fact of that contact, was supposed to be
considered routine?
Mrs. Scaletti. Right. It was still handled in a routine
NW 50955 DocId:32277223 Page 19
TOP SECRET
001725
17
manner.
Mr. Goldsmith.
Would the fact that a cable had bee nused
to communicate with headquarters indicate that the contact was
considered to be important?
Mrs. Scaletti. No. As I told you previously, and I will
repeat, you generally would use a cable for a name trace for
the expediency so that you could get a reply back within a
reasonable working period.
Mr. Goldsmith.
Let us take a look at that cable now.
would like to show you what has been marked CIA Number 177,
and when I refer to these numbers, I am referring to the
red numbers at the bottom of the page. The Agency has been
kind enough to make these documents available to the Committee
at our officese.
I
For purposes of allowing athe Agency to make
sure that each document is properly returned to it, the Agency
has numbered each piece of paper. I use those numbers for
the purpose of the deposition for our record. Would you
please examine CIA Number 177?
Mrs. Scaletti. Is that the cable that first brought Lee
Oswald to your attention?
Mrs. Scaletti.
I presume so.
I can't remember that far
back.
Mr. Goldsmith. What is the date of that cable?
Mrs. Scaletti. 19 October 1963.
Mr. Goldsmith. Is it 19 or 9?
NW 50955 DocId: 32277223 Page 20
TOP SECRET
001726
18
it.
Mrs. Scaletti. 19 October 1963. That is the way I read
Mr. Goldsmith. Let us take a look at CIA Number 178.
Mrs. Scaletti. It could be 9. That is not really that
pertinent, is it? Here it is 9 because here is the zulu time.
So that is 9.
Mr. Goldsmith. What time?
Mrs. Scaletti.
Zulu time.
Mr. Goldsmith. What is zulu time?
Mrs. Scaletti. Greenwich. I believe that is what it is.
Zero nine zero four three would be the 9th of 043 zed.
Mr. Goldsmith.
What is zed?
Mrs. Scaletti.
2.
Mr. Goldsmith. That refers to Greenwich time?
Mrs. Scaletti. I believe. But you can check the date
with that.
Mr. Goldsmith.
I was going to say if we take a look at
CIA Number 178, that is the Mexico City station copy of that
telegram
Mrs. Scaletti. I am sorry, what number?
Mr. Goldsmith.
Number 178. That indicates that the
cable was sent on 8 October, so it is likely that headquarters
would have received it bythe 9th.
Mrs. Scaletti.
Right. What am I supposed to do with
this one?
NW 50955 DocId:32277223 Page 21
TOP SECRET
001727
19
Mr. Goldsmith. Just wait for me to ask you a question.
Would you please read that cable?
Mrs. Scaletti.
Yes.
Mr. Goldsmith.
My first question is does that cable
contain a request for a name trace?
Mrs. Scaletti.
No, unless I really goofed reading.
Mr. Goldsmith.
Please reread it.
Mrs. Scaletti. No, it requests no specific name trace.
Mr. Goldsmith.
Now, in the basence of a name trace hwat
significance would you attach to the cable in light of the fact
that it was sent by means of cable instead of dispatch?
Mrs. Scaletti.. That they were informing headquarters of
a possible American, because even though it says American male,
when you check them out it is not an American male. They
alerted headquarters to the fact that a possible American had
contacted the Soviet embassy.
Mr. Goldsmith. I understand that is what they are inform-
ing headquarters about. My question is, does the fact that
they used the cable suggest that Mexico City station considered
this to be a priority item?
Mrs. Scaletti. I really cannot read into their thinking.
As a spot thing like this I probably would have reported it
by cable. I can't really comment on that.
Mr. Goldsmith. I understand.
The reason I asked the
question is because earlier, my recollection of the statement
NW 50955 DocId: 32277223 Page 22
TOP SECRET
001728
20
was that you said a cable would be used for something that was
priority item or if there was a request for a name trace.
There was no request for a name trace there. I am wondering if
this fits into the other category, a priority item?
Mrs. Scaletti. Not necessarily.
We did an awful lot
of cabling out of Mexico of these spot things instead of writing
full dispatches. This is a lot quicker and really less expen-
sive to do than in a cable. A lot of this is just how you react
and how you handle things.
There is no regulation which says what has to be done
by cable and what has to be done by dispatch. It is up to the
CO or the individual.
Mr. Goldsmith. Are there no written regulations govern-
ing when dispatches are to be used as opposed to cable?
Mrs. Scaletti. Sometimes.
Mr. Goldsmith. So there are regulations governing the
instances?
Mrs. Scaletti. Right.
Mr. Goldsmith. Does this cable contain a description of
Lee Harvey Oswald?
Mrs. Scaletti. It provides a description of a male that
looked to be an American who entered the Soviet Embassy.
Mr. Goldsmith. Is the answer yes or no.
Mrs. Scaletti.
I can't tell.
Mr. Goldsmith.
Read the description contained in the

second paragraph.
Mrs. Scaletti. Correct.
Mr. Goldsmith. The first paragraph mentions Oswald?
Mrs. Scaletti. The first paragraph mentions Oswald.
Mr. Goldsmith. The second paragraph also refers to a
photograph and then it describes the person who appears in the
photograph, is that correct?
Mrs. Scaletti. That is correct.
Mr. Goldsmith. Is this photograph linked to Oswald?
Mrs. Scaletti. In this cable it is not directly linked
to Oswald.
Mr. Goldsmith. Is it indirectly linked to Oswald?
Mrs. Scaletti. In this cable it is not indirectly linked
either. I might say, to clarify, that in many instances we
would receive cables like this and it would be the same person.
Rather than put a lot of wordage in they put this down, what
they heard and this is what they have seen, and maybe without
putting all the language there may be or may not be indentifiable
or this could possible be the same person.
We were very careful to do this when we go out to third
agencies.
Mr. Goldsmith. Certainly the Mexico City station would
not send up a cable containing simply the information reflected
in paragraph number 2?
Mrs. Scaletti. No, because it was worth nothing.

Mr. Goldsmith. So you are saying you believe, and you
may correct me if I am wrong, that the cable would not put in
all of the extra verbage such as saying "this may be Oswald".
Instead they would give you the information on Oswald in
paragraph 1. In paragraph 2 they report the fact of a photo-
graph and the fact that they report the particular photograph
simply means this may or may not be Oswald?
Mrs. Scaletti. Yes. What they have done is obvious to
me now and I would assume this might have been the way I
interpreted it at the time, that they got the phone call. The
station went and said "now, look, can we identify him" and
they went to the photograph.
The only photographs they saw which could have been
you know, in case this man had walked in around that time, may-
be this is the one they think it is, so let us give them the
description, it might help Washington.
Mr. Goldsmith. So, the significance of that second
paragraph is that this might be Oswald?
Mrs. Scaletti.
This is the way I interpret it now.
I
probably interpreted it at the time but I can't remember my
exact though processes so many years ago. I would not now
have gone back to the station and said "why did you send me
paragraph 2?"
Mr. Goldsmith. I understand that paragraph 2 does not
say "Have photograph of Oswald."

Mrs. Scaletti. Right.
Mr. Goldsmith. I just wanted to clarify that your answer
was that paragraph 2 meant this may be Oswald even though that
lenguage was not expressly used.
Mrs. Scaletti.
Right.
Mr. Goldsmith.
Do you know, and I realize you just gave
an opinion as to what may have happened, do you know how the
people in Mexico City station went about the process of obtain-
ing that photograph and suggesting that that photograph may
be Oswald?
Mrs. Scaletti. I have no knowledge of how the station
did this. I could only guess what the process of a person in
the station would be.
Mr
