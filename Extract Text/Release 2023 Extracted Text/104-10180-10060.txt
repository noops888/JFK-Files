Qualified for: Minister of Public Works
Biography:

Political Af-
filiation and
Attitudes:

CONSTRUCTION ENGINER
Born June 1924 in Havana. Educated in Cuban univer-
sities and became a very able construction engineer.
He was politically unknown until 1957. In early
1957 he joined the Internal Resistance Movement (MRC).
After engaging in numerous clandestine activities, he
was rade Secretary General of the MRC and a leader of
the 26th of July Movement for Havana Province. At the
time, he was President of the liavana Society of Civil
Engineers and was employed by the Frederick Snare
Corporation on the Hotel Hilton project. When Batista
was overthrown, Castro made Ray his Minister of
Public Works. Ray did a very creditable job "re-
building" Cuba and acquired a substantial popular
following. As Minister of Public Works, he showed a
great understanding of the needs of the people of Cuba
and a real concern for their welfare.
Although liberal and pro-revolutionary, Ray resented
the Communist domination of the Castro regime and in
November 1959 he was replaced by a Communist. He
lived for several months under surveillance that
amounted to house arrest and was unable to acquire
another post. However, he remained in Cuba and
organized the MRP as an anti-Castro movement. He
escaped to the US in October 1960. His leadership,
ability, and integrity are unmistakable.
Current Posi-
tion and Loca-
tion:
In the US as an MRP leader.
