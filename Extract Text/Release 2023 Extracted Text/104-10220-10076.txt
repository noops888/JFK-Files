Quintin PINO-MACHADO (201-292159)
"Luis de Almsida CUNHA, 2nd Secy, Brazilian Embassy in Hungary,
stated that he thought KACHADO was a typical 'action seeker looking for via-
lance and opportunistically birdin; for status. He said that while
he (CUHA) was in OAS in Washington, that a Cuban friend and his
brother were the targets of a kidnapping operation by MACHADO and two
thugs as a result of MACHADO's police duties as the doputy to the
then Cuban Ambassador. CUCIA said that this incident in which the Cuban
brothers thrashed MACHADO was a matter of Washington police record."
