(5) GOLD (characterized KARLOW as being primarily interested
in associating with "front office personnel; that when KARLOW did
mingle with the co-workers, it was more or less an act of
condescendence. (5x)(4)
(U)GOLD
advised that because of the wide area that TAD
was servicing in behalf of CIA, it was necessary that a number
of TAD personnel be constantly travelling ( GOLD remarked that
he was travelling steadily and that KARLOW was a frequent
traveler in behalf of TAD GOLD could recall no specific dates
of trips by KARLOW during the period 1950 to 1953, but

was not sure of the date. He mentioned HOUCK was still (Chief
of Base at Berlink and said he saw HOUCK, KARLOW explained that
military orders were necessary for any travel into Berlin,
including flight by Pan American Airways, which also operated
under military control. He stated the orders for travel by
train were the most formal, since a check by the Soviets was
involved

KARLOW related one of his men from TAD, DANIEL C.

He thought this was in 1951 or affer 1951. He also stated that

and
KARLOW said he could not say whether he was in Berlin
in August, 1951, but recalled he was there on at least one
occasion in the summer because be clearly remembered how early
the sun rose in the morning
GW) HARRY HXPOSITZKE
KARLOW stated he rarely became involved in operations
and was usually occupied in making arrangements and setting things
up for use of the facilities of TAD. He recalled, however, he was
involved in an operation with JOHN PARKER and HARRY ROSITZKE of
the SR (Soviet Russia) Division and flew to Berlin'in 1952 in
this connection. KARLOW explained the operation involved a planned
attempt to steal the latest model MIG fighter plane and great
preparation had been made but at the last minute the adventure
was called off because of possible, political and diplomatic
repercussions OHN WILLIAMS PARKER
PARKER
KARLOW first said he was unable to recall visiting
Berlin in 1953 but later said he recalled seeing WILLIAM K. HARVEY,
Chief of Station, (December, 1952, to August, 1959) on more than
one occasion so he supposes he did make such visits. When
-
informed that it was understood that KARLOW had been to Berlin
ten to fifteen times in the period 1950 1953, KARLOW offered
no objection and said it was possible that this was true. With
reference to his later assignment in Munich from November, 1953,
to the end of 1955, KARLOW stated he was fairly certain he had
not visited Berlin during this period.

some visits to Berlin and on one or more occasions he stayed
the Harnach House, an Army guest house for the Berlin command

KARLOW also stated that after his marriage he and his
wife had gone to Corsica on two occasions, and to Rome, and had

having taken a trip to Berlin for purely personal purposes

RAUSCH had gone to Berlin and stayed at the residence of
WILLIAM K. HARVEY. KARLOW said he had not visited Berlin with
"LIBBY" before marriage but recalled he had done so on one
occasion after marriage and he recollected he he had had becor become ill
on the train from some oysters he had eaten.

to Frankfurt and took over as Chief of TAD which was located
in the Frankfurt Suburb of Hoechst at Feldbergstrasse 44, and
had mail address APO 709. KARLOW resided in an apartment
located in an adjoining building. KARLOW advised when he
assumed charge of TAD the unit consisted of only about nine

recollection he remembers contacting a Professor HAROLD
MOSELEY, who was Head of Soviet Studies at Columbia University
In New York City, when [DULIN was recruiting employees. (DULIN) (U)
said that upon thoughtful consideration of his activities at
that time he recalled that there was a CIA interest in ob-
taining a well-qualified man for a position in Moscow. He
said efforts were being made to find a man who was to have
This person to be hired
Was supposed to have a fluent command of the Russian language
and he had to be of Anglo-Saxon descent. He said CIA gave
instructions that the man to be placed in the position in
Moscow could not be of Slovak HKC descent KCC CEDULINE Said it is
(U)
possible that HAROLD MOSELEY referred ROBERTS to DULIN as (U)
a prospective employee for the position in Moscow
but at this time he has no recollection of either the name
(0) or the face of ROBERTS. He said he could definitely state
he had never taken any recruit to Admiral HILLENKOTTER to
discuss employment DULIN said he does not know and does
not believe he has ever known the identity of any CIA
employee in Moscow, Russia

lating to recruitment of employees

(UDULIN said he is acquainted with HARRY A, ROSITZKE,
who is also employed with CIA (DULIN said his association
with ROSITZKE is not now and has never been close. He said
he is unable to recall exactly when he became acquainted
with ROSITZKE but he associates their meeting with a period
shortly following World War II. He is unable to state how
they became acquainted because they have never been assigned
to the same work. They have never lunched together and they
