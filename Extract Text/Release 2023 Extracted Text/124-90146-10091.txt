NOTE CONTINUED FOR LEGAT, BERN, AND SAC, NY:
For Bern's information, Gibson, a Security Index subject
of the New York Office, is former Acting Executive Secretary of
pro-Castro organization, Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC)。
In view of CIA's information indicating subject is presently
in Lausanne, Switzerland, and its previous interest in this
matter, authority is being granted for CIA to pass the requested
information to their source in this instance. By separate commu-
nication pertinent reports concerning the subject are being
furnished for Bern's information and future assistance in this.
matter. Bern should alert sources for any additional information
regarding subject's activities and whereabouts.
NOTE:
(0)
CIA advised that an official Swiss source furnished information
indicating subject had recently arrived in Switzerland from Algiers.
Subject reportedly came to Swiss attention through association with
and working for an individual who has had numerous contacts in
international leftist circles "of all shades" CIA's source
requested background data re subject.
We previously requested State Department and CIA to
alert their sources when Gibson left the US. for Algeria.
Subsequently, CIA advised by liaison that it was giving
consideration to possible utilization of Gibson on an iintelligence
mission inside Cuba and future utilization of Gibson by CIA would
(U) depend on his performance in Cuba. It is noted subject, during
previous FBI interview in the U. S., indicated he would assist
FBI and/or CIA in return for financial remuneration but not due
to allegiance to U. STK He stated he did not like the FBI Land
matter was referred to CIA) Ordinarily, we would furnish information
from Bufiles to sources abroad through our Legal Attaches; however,
in this instance it is felt CIA should be authorized to so handle
in view of its previous interest in sub subject. Further, this is first
indication of subject's residence in Switzerland and Legat, Bern,
has no prior background concerning this matter.

the Cultural Attache. In April 1963 it was learned that ANDERSSON
published a luxury-edition of a brochure, entitled "Leninisme et

2. The official Swiss source has no previous record of the GIBSONS
nor any adverse information to date. They have requested information on
them. Permission is requested to pass the following summary on Subject,
taken from reports of your Bureau, to the official Swiss Yource (refer-
ence is made to your file on Richard GIBSON, No. 105-93072 and specifically
to the reports on him dated 5 Octaber 1961, 24 January 1962, 27 August...
1962, 17 September 1962, 24 September 1962, and 20 May 1963):
a.
Richard Thomas Gibson, American Negro journalist, born 13 May 1931
in Los Angeles, California, was active in the New York chapter of the
Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC) from the time of its organization
in the spring of 1960 until his departure for Algeria in the fall of
1962. The FPCC has been supported by the Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
and Gibson has busied himself as well with other front groups in the
United States supported by the SWP. (The Socialist Workers Party has
been designated by the Attorney General of the United States pursuant
to Executive Order 10450.)
b. Gibson apparently began to lose interest in the FPCC, partly
because of inadequate pay and operating funds, by the spring of
1962 when he stated that he intended to leave the organization in
the fall. Gibson left Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, in September 1962
for Algeria where he planned to work as a journalist for several
South American and European newspapers (none identified) and to
travel to Morocco, Ghana, Guinea and Mali before returning to the
United States. Eventually, both Gibson and his wife were given
posts with Revolution Africaine a journal reportedly financed by
the Algerian Government.

c. Gibson's English wife, Sarah, was identified with the "English
Bureau" of Revolution Africaine as of February 1963. Prior to his
departure from the United States Gibson served as Executive Secretary
