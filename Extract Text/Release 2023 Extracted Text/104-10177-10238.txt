2023 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
A 12 347 777
MORALES entered the U.S. as a Cuban
refugee at Miami, Fla 29 Nov 60. He was a self-admitted
former G-2 agent. In the U.S. in 61-62 he became
a leader in the anti-Castro group Commandos Libres.
Other info. in 61 stated that he was a possible G-2
agent who had infiltrated anti-Castro movement in
Miami, Fla.
Granted POA 18 Mar 64 for use as radio operator
and leader for PM infiltration team.
Operated under MOC eff 1 May 64 at $200. mo.
OA granted 19 May 64.
Terminated 26 Aug 64 - never used in Agency sponsored
mission. Reason: security violation. MORALES
made several attempts to find out about a JM/AVE/FM
op going as far as contacting wives of agents already
committed on ops. KOT recommended for re-use. Too
"wise" and not too clever for own good. MORALES was
warned to stay away from known op contacts of Agency
interest.
He was re-recruited by SOD Sept 64 for VITEGAS Project
as pilot in Congo but never served this capacity.

MORALES told a Caracas Station asset in Mar 72 that
he was employed by the FBI and recd salary of U.S.
$700 month and was en route to Colombia on drug
case at that time. MORALES is not listed in the
XXX ISR source registry and I do not know what if
any current association he has with FBI.
On 2 Oct 72 BNDD Miami registered MORALES in the
narcotics registry as its informant. BNDD was
aware at that time that MORALES was of interest
to the FBI and stated that BNDD did not intend
to confer with or negotiate with FBI on how MORALES
was to be used.
In 72 MORALES claimed to Caracas asset that he was
in touch with CTA but we unable to substantiate claim
so apparently it untrue.
The way it looks to me is this:
MORALES is currently source
also may be FBI source
Is not CIA source
source
There is ref that MORALES is U.S. CITIZEN which I
have not been able to confirm at this point.
A ref I'm attempting to locate states he's a rep.
of GRUICO. Seems like a cover org. but at this
