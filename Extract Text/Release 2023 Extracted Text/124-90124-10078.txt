Clements said the Cubans wanted to have a meeting and he was willing
to escort them into the building (Pentagon). He said he had a Pentagon ID.
I told him that I had passed the information he had to the DIA but they had
not responded as yet about a meeting..
I told him I would call later in the morning. I then called DIA/NMIC
to pass the new information to them. DIA called back shortly and said I
would be contacted by someone in the CIA.
A little later Mr. John Bestic, CIA/DDO called and asked that I go
down to DIA/NMIC so he could discuss the situation with me on a secure
telephone. I told him of my call from Clements and about the previous
incident. He said he had only sketchy information on the first incident
but that he would look into it immediately. I told him Clements was waiting
for a return call. He said he would take of that. I dropped the matter.
Approximately one hour later I received another call from Clements
because no one had called him. I told him I would call back shortly. I
called DIA/NMIC and asked them to inform the CIA. A Mr. Clayton, telephone
351-74517 called me back and said the CIA was not interested in talking to
the Cubans because of their known affiliation with an anti-Castro terrorist
group in the US. He suggested I pass the information to the FBI, Mr. Willis
Walton, FBI/INTED, telephone 175-4656 (interagency call). Mr. Walton knew
of the Cubans from other activities. I told him what had transpired. He
recommended that I inform Clements that no agency of the US Government is
willing to meet with the Cubans and suggest that he visit the nearest FBI
field office and pass what information he has to them. I called Clements
and informed him of the FBI's recommendation. I dropped the matter.
At approximately 1400 the same day, a man came into the office (Africa
Region) and said he was Dick Clements. I asked for identification and he
showed a Pentagon building pass. I introduced him to Mr. Reed, Director,
Africa Region, OASD/ISA, and Mr. Hamilton, the analyst responsible for
Angolan affairs. Clements said he was in the building on other business
and just "dropped by". He said he had met with the Cubans and informed
them that no agency would meet with them. He said a third Cuban was with
them Robert Carballo, their contact with Cuba. Clements said that during
their conversation he determined: (1) that the information about the
desire of a number of Cubans in Angola to defect came from Roberto Carballo
through other Cubans who had returned to Cuba from Angola, (2) that the
Cubans had been in contact with representatives of President Somoza of
Nicaragua, seeking his assistance, (3) that the basic concept was to set
up stations in a country bordering Angola and wage a campaign to inform
Cubans still in Angola of their existence, with the expectation (based
on the evidence they had) that large numbers of Cubans would take advantage
of the opportunity to defect. Clements also said he overheard a conversation
