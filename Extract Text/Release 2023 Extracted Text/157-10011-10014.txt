SANCHEZ met with AMLASH in Paris.
AMLASH indicated that although he was unable to
carry out his plans during the past year, he "continued to feel that his solution to
the Cuban problem was the only one feasible and that he had to continue trying."
(100) AMLASH "was told that the U.S. Government could not and would not in any
way become involved or provide assistance in the task he had planned for himself."
(100)
However, the IG REPORT explains that SAS "contrived to put (MANUEL) ARTIME and
(AMLASH) together in such a way that neither knew that the contact had been engineered
by the CIA. The thought was that ARTIME needed a man inside and (AMLASH) wanted a
silenced weapon, which CIA was unwilling to furnish to him directly. By putting
the two together, ARTIME might get his man inside and (AMLASH) might get his silenced
weapon--from ARTIME CIA did not intend to furnish an assassination weapon for ARTIME

SGA discussed various possibilities of accomplishing reconaissance of Cuba, ranging from
very low level coverage by tactical aircraft to high performance aircraft and drones. Over-
flights and peripheral flights were discussed.
It was agreed that the first priority is one high performance mission in the western part of
the island, to be accompanied by all out Elint support. Depending on the results of this,
a number of similar searches may be mounted. First mission was later approved by higher
authority, but the decision on the second proposition left open.
The entire package was to be discussed at the USIB, and by Chiefs on Wednesday, October 10th.

that he had been asked to create a capability for Executive Action and had taken
certain steps to have an assessment of assets in that connection. (57) Harvey

means he should be advised. He should not be advised, he should never be advised,
