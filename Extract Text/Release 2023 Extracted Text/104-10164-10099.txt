FOR: LA/VCE
of
SUBJECT: POSSIBLE RELEASE OF CUBAN EXILE LEADER ORLANDO BOSCH
REFERENCE: WASHINGTON 173605
1. LEGALLY THERE IS LITTLE CHANCE OF CONVICTING BOSCH
AND THE OTHERS BECAUSE THE CRIME WAS NOT COMMITTED IN VENEZUELA
AND THUS VENEZUELA HAS NO JURISDICTION IN THE CASE. SECONDLY,
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE AGAINST BOSCH AND GROUP. THESE ARE THE
OPINIONS OF A NUMBER OF STATION AGENTS AND CONTACTS INCLUDING
WKALIKE-1, WKDIET-6 AND
WKSCARLET-٩.
2.. WHILE HERNAN AND LUGO SUPPOSEDLY CONFESSED TO THE
CRIME IN TRINIDAD, THEIR CONFESSIONS ARE NOT ADMISSABLE IN
COURT AND THEY HAVE DECLINED TO REPEAT THEM FOR VENEZUELAN
JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES. THE EVIDENCE LINKING HERNAN AND LUGO
TO POSADA COMES FROM TELEPHONE TAPS, WHICH ARE LIKEWISE
INADMISSABLE, BOSCH'S CONNECTION WITH THE CASE COMES FROM.
A TELEPHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN LUGO AND POSADA IN WHICH
THE NAME "ORLANDO" IS MENTIONED. DEFENSE ATTORNEYS COULD
MAKE A GOOD CASE THAT THE "ORLANDO" WAS DISIP OFFICER ORLANDO
GARCIA AND NOT ORLANDO BOSCH.
3. THE GOV COULD, OF COURSE, PUT PRESSURE ON THE COURT
AND JUGGLE THE EVIDENCE TO GET A CONVICTION, BUT TO DO SO WOULD
LEAVE IT OPEN FOR CRITICISM INTERNALLY AND REPRISALS FROM THE
CUBAN EXILES, AND WOULD MAKE IT MORE LIKELY THAT THE DEFEND
DANTS WOULD DIVULGE EMBARRASSING INFORMATION CONNECTING
GOVERNMENT FIGURES TO BOSCH AND THE EXILES HE LED.
