Dear Ms. Goodpasture:
This is to confirm our two recent phone conversations
concerning the JFK assassination records. I am writing
this letter in my capacity as the DCI's liaison with the
Assassination Records Review Board.
The Review Board requests the opportunity to interview
you as part of its mandate to identify information relevant
to President Kennedy's assassination that may be released
to the public. The Board members were appointed by
President Clinton under authorization of the John F. Kennedy
Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992.
Mr. Jeremy Gunn, the Board's General Counsel, will contact
you to make arrangements for the interview. You are authorized
to discuss with Board members or staff information pertaining
to the assassination, Lee Harvey Oswald's activities in Mexico
City, and any US Government investigations into either.
The Board members and staff have been cleared for
classified information up to Top Secret, including
compartmented information. They have had complete access to
all pertinent CIA files. Mr. Gunn has an SCI clearance from
the Agency. Therefore, you may answer questions candidly
and completely, including with classified information.
Disclosures to the members and staff of the Board will not
violate your secrecy agreement.
This letter has been prepared in consultation with
CIA's Office of General Counsel. If you have any questions
concerning this letter, please call me on 703-351-2802.
Sincerely,
John F. Pereira

I am writing to you on behalf of the Assassination Records Review Board, an
independent Federal Agency established pursuant to the President John F. Kennedy
Assassination Records Collection Act, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994). The Review
Board, whose members are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, is
charged with collecting records related to the assassination of President Kennedy. The
Review Board is not seeking to reach any conclusions regarding the assassination, but is
primarily concerned with identifying, clarifying, locating, and making available
assassination records. I am enclosing some explanatory material about the Review
Board and its mandate.
As part of our mandate, we have been reviewing records that originated with the
Central Intelligence Agency. Several of the records relate to the investigation of Lee
Harvey Oswald's trip to Mexico City and his alleged association with the Fair Play for
Cuba Committee and anti-Castro organizations. We have some questions about these
subjects as well as a related event that involved James Angleton traveling to Mexico
City in 1971 to acquire Win Scott's papers. We hope that you may be able to assist us in
determining the existence of various assassination records connected with the events
described above.
We would like to request a meeting to discuss the aforementioned issues. We invite
you to come to our offices in Washington, but we would be more than willing to meet
you at your home or another convenient location. We will be contacting you in the near
future to arrange for a convenient time for you.

I am writing you on behalf of the Assassination Records Review Board, an independent
Federal Agency established pursuant to the President John F. Kennedy Assassination
Records Collection Act, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994). The Review Board, whose

material about the Review Board and its mandate.
As Michelle Combs mentioned in her telephone call last Tuesday, we would like very
much to discuss your work experiences in Moscow from 1957-1959 with you. We
believe that your past in-depth knowledge of the Moscow Embassy and its procedures
may assist the ARRB in our attempts to clarify the historical record in this area.
Before talking with you, we would like to make certain that you would feel free to
discuss fully all relevant aspects of your work in Moscow. To the extent that you think
that discussion of your work might possibly involve classified or sensitive matters, we
would like to resolve such concerns in a way that would provide you with whatever
assurance that you need that you would not be improperly divulging classified
information. If you feel discussing this subject with the Review Board would constitute
disclosure of any information that is still classified, we will be happy to initiate a
discussion between you and the appropriate officials to address any concerns you may
-have.
One of the members of our staff, Michelle Combs, will be calling to arrange a mutually

Russia House has looked at Michelle Combs' memo on her interview of Russell Langelle.
The only areas of concern they had, which they said they could not comment on knowledgeably, are:
The mention of George Payne Winters, Jr. They do not know if he is overt.
The mention of the HTLINGUAL program in the last paragraph of page two. They are not familiar with this program and don't
know if this program is overt/has been publicly acknowledged by the Agency.
If you could check into these two matters or tell me where to get the answers, I would appreciate it. Thanks.

OVERFLYING RUSSIA
153
The next thing we tried was something called a Salisbury
screen, a metallic grid applied to the airplane's undercarriage
in the hope of deflecting incoming radar beams, but it worked
only at some frequencies and altitudes and not at others.
Kelly thought it was more practical to try special iron fer-
rite paints that would absorb a radar ping rather than
bounce it back to the sender. The paints were moderately ef-
fective but inhibited heat dissipation through the airframe's
outer skin and we experienced overheating engine problems.
But the paint lowered the radar cross section by one order of
magnitude, so we decided to give it a try. We called these
specially painted airplanes "dirty birds" and shipped the first
one out for flight testing in April 1957. Our test pilot, Bob
Sieker, took the U-2 up to over seventy thousand feet and
suddenly radioed that he was experiencing rapid airframe
heat buildup. Moments later his engine blew out and the face-
plate blew off Bob's oxygen mask as his pressure suit in-
stantly inflated. The U-2 dove straight down and crashed. It
took us three days to locate the wreckage and Bob's body. An
autopsy revealed that above seventy thousand feet he had
suffered acute hypoxia and lost consciousness in only ten
seconds. The culprit that killed him was a defective faceplate
clasp that cost fifty cents.
The CIA was so desperate to buy time for these Soviet over-
flights that Bissell got Kelly to sequester four of our test flight
engineers and have them write a bogus flight manual for a U-2
twice as heavy as ours and with a maximum altitude of only
fifty thousand feet that carried only scientific weather gear in
its bay. The manual included phony instrument panel photos
with altered markings for speed, altitude, and load factor
limits. Four copies were produced and then artificially aged
with grease, coffee stains, and cigarette burns. How or if the
agency got them into Soviet hands only Mr. B knew, and he
never told.

Also enclosed is an excerpt from the book Skunk Works, by Ben Rich and Leo Janos,
which refers to Lockheed's preparation of four sets of falsified U-2 technical manuals at
the direction of Richard Bissell of the CIA. Co-author Leo Janos has identified you to
the Review Board as having formerly been Richard Bissell's direct assistant for U-2
program matters, and has suggested that you may be a source of further information in
this area of inquiry. We would like very much to discuss this subject with you, and
believe that your experiences and recollections may assist ARRB in our attempts to

Dear Mr. McVickar:
FYI
I am writing you on behalf of the Assassination Records Review Board, an independent
Federal agency established pursuant to the President John F. Kennedy Assassination
Records Collection Act, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994). The Review Board, whose
members were appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, is charged with
the responsibility of collecting records and information related to the assassination of
President Kennedy. The Review Board members and staff are required by law to
possess Top Secret and SCI clearances. The Review Board is not seeking to reach any
conclusions regarding the assassination, but is primarily concerned with identifying,
clarifying, locating, and making available information about the assassination. I am
enclosing some explanatory material about the Review Board and its mandate.
We would like very much to discuss your work experiences in Moscow from 1959-1961
with you, particularly as it pertained to the USSR residènce of Lee Harvey Oswald. We
have reviewed the transcripts of your testimony to the Warren Commission and to the
House Select Committee on Assassinations. We believe that your knowledge of Oswald
and the Moscow Embassy may assist the ARRB in our attempts to clarify the historical
record in this area.
One of the members of our staff, Dr. Michelle Combs, will be calling to arrange a
mutually agreeable time and place for an interview. We anticipate being in the Boston
area in the near future and would easily be able to visit with you in Stowe if that would
be most convenient for you.
Before talking with you, we would like to make certain that you would feel free to
discuss fully all relevant aspects of your work in Moscow. To the extent that you think
that discussion of your work might possibly involve classified or sensitive matters, we
would like to resolve such concerns in a way that would provide you with whatever
assurance that you need that you would not be improperly divulging classified
information. In the course of our interviews with other persons, we have arranged with

the appropriate officials at State, CIA, DOD, FBI, and other agencies to obtain waivers to
allow persons to speak to us. Our principal liaison with the State Department, for
example, is Nina Noring, IM/FPC/HDR, Room B234, Department of State, 2201 C
Street NW, Washington, D.C. 20520, (202) 647-8799. If you believe you have any
information that might touch upon the equities of the CIA, DoD, the FBI or any other
agency, you should feel free to ask us to arrange for an initial contact with them or you
may wish to contact them yourself.
Please do not hesitate to call (collect) for either Dr. Combs or myself. We look forward
to speaking with you.
Sincerely,
Dr. T. Jeremy Gunn
