1. JAGUAR has forwarded us the attached press cuttings
by or about Jonathan Power, whose name has cropped up from time
to time in our MHCHAOS reporting. Jonathan Richard Adrian
Power was born 4 June 1941 in the UK and carries a British
passport No. D430314, renewed 21 July 1969. He is a journalist
who has written for a number of publications and has been
associated with television, but claims employment with the
Economist. JAGUAR'S only other comment was that a source of
theirs on the Hazlemere Group (subject of previous reporting)
stated in June 1969 that Power spoke of Cuba in a way which
suggested that he had visited there.
2. The attached documents and the above information have
also been passed to the local LNERGO representative.
