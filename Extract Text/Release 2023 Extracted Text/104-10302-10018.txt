World Reaction to Change of US
Administration
World reaction to the as-
sassination of President Ken-
nedy and its aftermath is in-
creasingly preoccupied with
speculation over the possible
effects on US foreign and do-
mestic policies.
Oswald's Communist back-
ground, however, and his dra-
matic murder while in police
custody are being exploited for
almost every conceivable proра-
ganda line. The USSR continues
to reflect sensitivity over Os-
wald's political motivations;
Khrushchev, talking with Am-
bassador Kohler on 23 November,
recalled that Lenin had con-
demned "nihilist" activities
and asserted the Soviet Communist
Party is traditionally opposed
to terrorism.
Pravda, citing a denial by
{the US Communist Party that Os-
wald had ever been a member,
suggested he was linked to
"American Trotskyites," but con-
cluded that the Kennedy assas-
sination was the work of "fasc-
ist forces" trying to destroy
the detente atmosphere.
Papers in West Germany,
Belgium, and Lebanon, among
others, theorize Oswald was
killed by associates to silence
him. A Cairo newspaper calls
his killer "one Jack Rubenstein,
a Jew of course." The US Em-
bassy in Beirut has received
many telegrams speculating that
1
Oswald's killing is evidence of
a Communist plot against the US.
The embassy notes with dismay
the probable foreign impact of
dramatic news photos showing the
escorting officer apparently
looking away while Oswald is
shot.
An Afrikaans paper in
Johannesburg editorialized that
while US racial difficulties
might not be "directly concerned
with the assassination," they
had become a vehicle for the
undermining of the state by the
Communists and Afro-Asians.
A Cairo editorial expresses
concern that President Johnson,
while committed to the policies
of his predecessor, may have to
compromise and postpone decisions
in order to avoid antagonisms
as the US enters an election
year. Syrian Vice President
Bitar commented to Ambassador
Knight on 25 November that the
Arab cause might suffer from
the loss of President Kennedy,
"who had shown signs of increas-
ingly better understanding of
the Arabs and their problems."
West German and French
press commentaries range from
expectations of initial uncer-
tainty or temporizing in US for-
eign policy to the gloomy view
of Der Spiegel that it is "doomed
to immobility" for the next
year. Some segments of the
British press had suggested
(continued)

that an opportunity existed for
development of a strong British
leadership in the Western alli-
ance, but London officials,
noting that the UK also faces
1964 elections, are not in-
clined to expect any radical
departures.
Genevieve Tabouis, writ-
ing in Paris Jour, expects no
major decisions from the pres-
ent meeting between President
Johnson and General de Gaulle,
but notes that De Gaulle will
probably urge that France-Ameri-
can problems be settled in the
course of 1964, while Johnson
will urge a "Western summit con-
ference."
The Peruvian Chamber of
Deputies on 24 November unani-
mously adopted a motion urging
the award of the Nobel Peace
Prize to President Kennedy.

2. Hanoi Apparently Renewing Cam-
paign for "Neutralization" of
South Vietnam
::
Hanoi appears to be re-
newing its campaign to generate
international support for the
"neutralization" of South Viet-
nam.
In pressing its neutraliza-
tion proposal, Hanoi probably
hopes to take advantage of Cam-
bodian Premier Sihanouk's re-
cent reiteration of his scheme
for an international guarantee
of neutrality for Cambodia,
Laos, and South Vietnam. The
North Vietnamese reportedly
have urged Premier Souvanna
Phouma of Laos to press for
adoption of their neutrality
proposition.
For the first time in nearly
a year, moreover, the Hanoi-con-
NBR
trolled National Front for the
Liberation of South Vietnam has
publicly restated its support
of the three-country neutrality
plan. North Vietnam is also
drawing support from Moscow and
Peiping, whose propaganda has
recently become less reticent
on the subject of South Viet-
namese neutrality.
North Vietnam's premier re-
portedly told a French official
recently that his country sees
indications of growing weariness
and dissatisfaction in the US
with the war in South Vietnam.
He implied that Hanoi intended
to keep up military and political
pressure in the South in order
to help induce American with-
drawal.

3. French Aid to Cambodia
NBR
France is considering ex-
tending additional economic and
military aid to Cambodia.
Despite the general irri-
tation in French Government
circles over Sihanouk's recent
actions, the prince's direct
appeal for French aid has posed
a dilemma for Paris. A flat
rejection could adversely affect
France's position in Africa and
the Middle East, as well as in
Southeast Asia. On the other
hand, Paris is probably reluc-
tant to take over the recently
canceled US financial commitments
in Cambodia.
The French are presently
reviewing what seems to be a
renewal of a long-standing

GENERAL
Cambodian request for more mili-
tary equipment, mostly obsoles-
cent. They are also thinking
of offering Phnom Penh $5 million
in economic and cultural aid,
plus either larger loans or
greater export credits.
Perhaps related to their
plans to assist Cambodia is the
strong possibility that French
Defense Minister Messmer will
be sent to Cambodia in January.
Since 1956, French grant
aid has amounted to $15 million.
Negotiations for an additional
$2 million have been deadlocked
for the past 18 months by dis-
agreements over exchange rates.

Rumania's Industrial Development
Rumanian party first secre-
tary Gheorghiu-Dej has just com-
pleted another tour of industrial
construction sites throughout
Rumania--his sixth such trip in
the last two months. The exten-
sive Rumanian press coverage of
the trip is designed to show
both Rumania's rapid economic
growth and its broadening trade
contacts with the West.
The Rumanian public has
been officially informed för
the first time of the extent
of West European participation
in the construction of indus-
trial installations in Rumania.
It is also the first time that
detailed information has been
given to the public regarding
industrial installations. Press
coverage divulges statistics on
production capacities of the
various installations as well
as on the items they produce.
Information on the planning
and construction of the facto---
ries also is unusually detailed.
On 13 November the party
visited Slatina, the site of
an aluminum plant whose con-
struction is just beginning.
According to the Rumanian press,
the plant ultimately will have
an annual production capacity
of 50,000 tons of aluminum and
alloys and will be completed in
the next 18 months with help of
a French firm. Other sources
NBR
indicate, however, that the
French firm is assisting in con-
struction of the first stage of
the plant, which will have a
30,000-ton capacity. Equipment
is being provided by several
West European countries, the
press reported.
The Craiova chemical com-
bine will include 14 factories
having a capacity of about 300,-
000 tons of ammonium nitrate
fertilizer and 100,000 tons of
urea, according to the press
which also reported that the
ammonia, nitric acid, and ammo-
nium nitrate factories--planned
and equipped by the USSR-- are
over two thirds completed.
Belgium, Holland, and West Ger-
many are supplying equipment
for portions of the combine.
From various sources it is
known that during 1960-61 West-
ern firms added several catalytic
refining installations to the
Brazi oil refinery, built in
1934. The Rumanian press now
reports that the Rumanians re-
cently completed construction
of a crude oil distillation
unit with a three-million-ton
capacity. This unit will boost
the plant's capacity from 1.5
million tons to 4.5 million tons
per year. Brazi is one of the
three major refineries in which
Rumania plans to concentrate
its refining capacity. The press
26 Nov 63

SECRET
also indicated that additional
facilities to be built at Brazi
will include a number of petro-
chemical installations:
an
ethylene-propylene plant prob-
ably purchased from Italy, a
polyethylene plastics plant from
the UK, and, an ethylene oxide
and ethylene glycol unit from
Italy. Brazi, along with another
combine at Borzesti, will be the
main centers for chemical pro-
duction based on petroleum.
Dej also visited numerous
other industrial installations
which have received both Western
and Soviet equipment and assist-
ance. In reporting the progress
of construction at these plants,
however, the Rumanians gave more
attention to the Western assist-
ance than to the Soviet contribu-
tions.
:
The belated open recognition of
the Western role in Rumania's eco-
nomic development undoubtedly re-
flects Rumania's desire to expand
further its trade ties with the
West. Rumanian officials have con-
stantly reiterated Bucharest's'
interest in purchasing modern tech-
nical machinery and equipment. (SE-

5. Peiping Approaches Cambodian
Crisis Carefully
The Chinese Communists are
showing considerable caution
in their reactions to Prince
Sihanouk's apparently unsolicited
outbursts concerning his inten-
sions to turn to them for aid,
although they are attempting to
appear responsive to his position.
In a 21 November government state-
ment, the Chinese carefully
avoided any real commitment to
Cambodia and were studiously
vague about the extent to which
they intend to support Sihanouk.
The Chinese hesitated for
over two weeks before issuing
their statement and they is-
sued it then because of the
pressure of a situation over
which they have no control.
The statement avoids the ques-
tion of economic or technical
aid. It does offer "all-out
support" for Cambodia in the
event of an invasion by the US,
Hom CAFBDS Cambodia 21/165
South Vietnam, or Thailand. Even
this high-sounding promise,
however, is carefully hedged
with a preliminary reference to
the 1954 Geneva agreements, sug-
gesting that "all-out support"
would be restricted to propа -
ganda calls for joint action
under the International Control
Commission and would not include
unilateral Chinese Communist
military aid.
While Peiping probably
could supplant US aid to Cam-
bodia, its enthusiasm is appar-
ently considerably dampened by
Sihanouk's unpredictability.
The Chinese are well aware that
previous expressions of similar
desires by Sihanouk were used
as pressure tactics to enhance
Cambodia's position. Although
in the present crisis Sihanouk
appears more serious than in
earlier ones, the Chinese are
unwilling to leap in before they
are certain of the outcome.

6. Viet Cong Activity in South
Vietnam
The accelerated tempo of
Viet Cong activity in the post-
coup period continues.
While the 149 Viet Cong
attacks recorded during the
week ending 18 November are a
drop from the previous week's
record high of 233, the number
is still about 50 percent above
normal for this year. Most of
the attacks continue to be on
a small scale. They are tar-
geted primarily against strate-
gic hamlets and outposts, with
government paramilitary forces
bearing the brunt. On 24 No-
vember, however, a reportedly
large Communist force overran

a post northwest of Saigon
where special forces were train-
ing under US auspices.
The Saigon government ap-
parently is proceeding with a
purge of military officers
holding high military, intelli-
gence, and provincial posts
under Diem. On 22 November it
announced the suspension of 31
officers. Some of these are
under arrest. The purges may
be partly in response to the
demands of student and Buddhist
groups seeking revenge against
prominent figures who sided
with Diem during the Buddhist
crisis. (SECRET)

Communist China Australia:
Communist China has contracted
for 1.1 million tons of grain
from Australia worth about $66
million--China's first major
grain purchase for 1964 delivery.
The Australian announcement
stated that terms of the sale
were similar to previous Sino-
Australian grain deals. China's
1963 grain crop will at most be
no better than last year's medi-
ocre crop and thus China would
have to import more than the
5.5 million tons of grain it
bought last year from the West,
if it is to have available as
much grain per person. (CONFI-

The small Democratic Socialist

While there has been no public

Developments in Laos
A well-coordinated clearing
action launched north of Vien-
tiane on 21 November by neutral-
ist, Lao Army, and Meo guerrilla
elements has met with consider-
able success. Government forces
have secured Vang Vieng, long
held by the Pathet Lao.
Although an earlier push
by a similar combination of
government forces in the Plaine
des Jarres area did not attain
comparable successes, the Pathet
Lao position at Xieng Khouang

town remains surrounded and
threatened.
Overt Communist reaction
to these developments has been
limited, thus far, to propaganda
blasts at the "perfidy" of the
neutralists in the current tenu-
ous series of negotiations.
There are, however, uncon-
firmed reports of North Viet-
namese troop reinforcements in
the Plaine des Jarres area. (SE-
