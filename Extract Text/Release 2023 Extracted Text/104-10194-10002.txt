The Director of Personnel
Dear Siri
5005 Edgomoor Lane
Strenda, aryland 20014
3 December 1968
This is a request for an extension of tire within which to
move my household effects from Karyland to a retiremert sito.
I retired at the end of July 1963 and my understanding 18
that the normal period for moving to a retirement site is
six months or until 31 January 1969 in my casu. It also is
my understanding that you have discretionary authority to
extend the tire.
My roquest is based on the ciroumstances described below.
During my tour of duty mediately preceding retirement, my
rot..or lost lor sig.t due to acute glauco:^. On my return
from overseas Ir. orler to rotire, one of the problems which
faced me was the care of my mother who had been living in
her own apartment in Bew Jersey. The problem became more
difficult coincidentally with my retirement when in July my
mother suffered a fall, resulting in multiple fractures of
her Dip. Since then she has been under the care of two
doctors, first in a hospital al currently in a nursing rore,
The extent to wition she will be apie to walk in questionable.
rrior wcotiring, I had planned to devote the time immediately
after the offective date of retirement to exploring retirerent
sites. De accident to my mother and problems related to it
have prevented the carrying out of my plans. I remain uncertain
about my retirement location and reaching a decision depends in
part on my mother's continuing need for care and upon my being
able to travel to investigate prospective retirement sites.
I am eager to resolve the matter but it appears Dost improbable
that I shall be able to do so prior to the end of next January.
I shall appreciate your granting an exte: son of time for moving
our household efects.
Very truly yours,
Harold F. Swenson
Approved -- Subject to movement of household effects commencing before
