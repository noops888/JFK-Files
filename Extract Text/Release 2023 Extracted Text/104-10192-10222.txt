Summary. Correspondence between the MDC in Miami and the MDC
delegation in Puerto Rico, and a letter from Enrique Villareal
de la Concepcion, MDC representative in Chile, indicates a
difference of opinion within the organization concerning the
MDC's views regarding the Chilean Christian Democratic Party
and Eduardo Frei Montalva, President of Chile. Villareal re-
signed from the MDC.
ン
i
1.
In a letter dated 29 July 1965 to the president of the Movimiento
Democrata Christiano (MDC, Christian Democratic Movement) in
Miami, the Puerto Rico delegation of the MDC set forth its
views on what it considered a "conspiracy of silence" against
Christian Democracy. It felt that the movement was being
harmed by deliberate distortion of facts, and that the cam-
paign was intensified by Chilean President Eduardo Frei
Montalva's trip through Europe. The delegation took exception
to statements about Cuba made by Frei, whom they considered
ill-informed. The delegation did not feel that public state-
ments should be made on this matter, but warned that Cubans
should be alert concerning Frei. The delegation suggested
that Frei should be censured by the national executive com-
mittee of the MDC.

agreed with the Puerto Rico delegation's concern about the
hostility toward the MDC in the press, and in political and
religious circles, which it said was more intense in Miami
than in Puerto Rico. The letter pointed out, however, that
there has been a noticeable change in the attitude of United
States Government officials toward the MDC; that the MDC is
treated with more respect and consideration. This was
attributed to the growing importance of Christian Democracy
in international relations, due to Frei's triumph and his
/policy of "hemisperic transcendence."
According to the letter, the national executive committee of
the MDC has been observing Frei's actions with growing alarm.
Since Frei's inauguration in November 1964, the MDC has been
inquiring about the Chilean Government's attitude toward
Cuba, and trying to exert influence over that attitude. In
interviews with Radomiro Tomic, Chilean Ambassador to the
United States, Otto Boye, International Relations Secretary
of the Chilean Partido Democrata Christiano (PDC, Christian
Democratic Party) when he visited Miami, land with other
leaders of the PDC, all said that Frei has not, and probably
would not make a policy statement on Cuba due to the com
plexity of the internal situation in Chile and because he
would not act unilaterally in hemispheric matters. They
claim that the statements attributed to Frei concerning Cuba
are loose quotations from speeches, intended for internal
consumption which are exaggerated or quoted out of context
by the press. The letter continued, that it was not advisable
to take a public stand against the statements attributed to
Frei as that would lead to a public debate with the PDC and
as a result would place other parties of the Christian
Democrat Organization of America (ODCA) in a position of
having to support one or the other.
:
The letter said that the MDC must gather documentation on what
Frei has said and written concerning Cuba, and assigned this
task to the Puerto Rico delegation. This documentation could
be studied at the next national congress, and from this
documentation it might be possible to develop a good defense
for Christian Democracy and the MDC. It warned that this
problem must be handled with self-control and without emotion,
Even though the MDC does not like Frei's position, he is the
first Christian Democrat to be elected president in the
Americas, he has the popular support in Chile, and continues
to gain in stature internationally. Also, he shows respect
and sympathy toward the MDC. He is a responsible person and
is not pro-Communist nor does he sympathize with the regime
of Fidel Castro Ruz. It would be a disservice to Cuba and to
the MDC if a split were provoked between the MDC and the PDC
or with Frei, pereenally. On the contrary, the solution to
the problem is a rapprochement because the MDC has faith in
the PDC to understand the MDC's viewpoints when they are
presented clearly.
:
In a letter dated 24 August 1965 to the president of the MDC,
Enrique Villareal de la Concepcion, MDC delegate in Chile,
said that he had received notice from Laureano Batista Falla,
secretary of delegations of the MDC, that he (Villareal)
would not represent the MDC at the ODCA meeting in Venezuela
from 12 to 14 August because he worked in the international
department of the PDC. He said that he had decided to resign
from the MDC and continue his work in Chile and his work for
the Latin American Confederation of Christian Sindicalists.

should become associated with the Latin American revolutionary

tribute to the processy which will accelerate the liberation
of Cuba. De considered it a grave error for the majority
of members of the executive committee to live in Miami, when
the future of Cuba is more closely tied to the future of
Latin America. He said that the policy makers of the MDC
have lost all objectivity, have become distrustful, and
imagine enemies and disloyalty everywhere. Ho closed by
saying that he intended no personal criticism, only political
criticisms.

A member of a group of Cuban emigres trained in the techniques
of information collection. The group has provided useful
reports since 1961.
On about 8 October 1965 Laureano Batista Falla, an official of
the Movimiento Democrata Cristiano (DC, Christian Democratic
Movement), returned to Miami from the Dominican Republic. In
a report to the executive committee of the MDC on the results
of his trip, he said that it appeared certain that the MDC would
lose its baso in the Dominican Republic. No expressed hope that
it would be possible to remove the possessions of the MDC from
the base.
Batista said that the Christian Democrats of the Dosinican
Republic support the forces of Francisco Caasiano Dono, former
Rebel president. He added that Hector Garcia-Godoy Caceres,
Provisional President of the Dominican Republic, has no control
over the situation, and that he might be deposed at any time.
According to Batista, all of the Cutans who are in the Dominican
Republic want to leave because their situation is desperate.
Also, many Dominicans are leaving for abroad. This exodus 18

A member of a group of Cuban emigres trained in the techniques

ports since 1961.
1. The Ninth Congress of the Movimiento. Democrata Cristiano (MDC,
Christian Democratic Movement) was held in Miami from 27 to 29
August 1965. There was little enthusiasm at the Congress as a
result of the dissatisfaction of the MDC with the Christian
Democratic movement in Latin America, and the fact that an in-
creasing number of members of the IDC identify themselves with,
and support the foreign policy of, the United States.
2.
It was decided at the Congress that the National Executive will
be elected for a one-year term, starting with the election of
February 1966. The National Executive elected at the Congress
for the period from September 1965 to February 1966 is composed

3. Followers of Batista who attended the Congress said that they
bad formed a block in the Organizacion Democrata Cristiano de
America (ODCA, Christian Democratic Organization of America)
with parties of other countries which agree with the stand of
the MDC on international affairs. This bloc includes the
parties of Brazil, Peru, Venezuela and Colombia. They plan
to compel the Chilean party and others to take a more definite
stand against Communism and the regime of Fidel Castro Ruz.
4.
Members of the Military Sector of the MDC met with the dele-
gates to the Congress on 29 August. Angel Hernandez Rojo
asked that the military budget be increased from $750.00 (U.S.)
per month to $70,000 per year, and that a base be established
in Central or South America, regardless of the distance from
Miami. He said that the MDC had sabotage and demolition,men
and equipment ready to operate in four provinces of Cuba, and
that a team of frogmen, which was completing training in Puerto
Rico, would be ready to operate "in a few days". He said that
they could not operate from the United States because of U.S.
Customs, and that the political situation in the Dominican
Republic makes it impossible to operate from the MDC base
there. He added that two boats which were at the base in the
Dominican Republic could not be used. Hernandez asked that
each delegation establish a military nucleus, and said that
he would visit each delegation to help organize the military
element within two months. The members of the Puerto Rico
delegation said that they would raise part of the $70,000
needed by the Military Sector.
