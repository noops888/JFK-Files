AN AMERICAN OBSERVER (B); FROM LIEUTENANT COLONEL PHAM NGOC THAO.
: PHAM NGOC THAO'S GROUP PROBABLY IS PLANNING A COUP D'ETAT AGAINST THE DIEM REGIME,
BUT WHETHER OR NOR THEY EVER ACHIEVE THE RIGHT COMBINATION OF UNITS TO TAKE ACTION
CANNOT BE ASSESSED. THAO'S OPINION OF THE ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM GENERALS
IS PROBABLY ACCURATE IN CERTAIN INSTANCES. THAO'S JUDGMENT OF. NGO DINH NHU'S
PERSONALITY AND CHARACTER IS POSSIBLY ACCURATE SINCE THAO IS A FORMER VIETNAMESE
COMMUNIST.
۱۰
1. SUMMARY. LIEUTENANT COLONEL PHAM NGOC THAO, SPECIAL INVESTIGATOR OF
STRATEGIC HAMLETS FOR THE PRESIDENCY, SAID ON 13 SEPTEMBER 1963 THAT THE COUP
D'ETAT PLANNING OF HIS GROUP IS PROGRESSING WELL, BUT THAT IT WILL NOT TAKE ACTION
UNTIL IT IS REASONABLY CERTAIN OF SUCCESS. THAO MAINTAINED THAT THE SOUTH
VIETNAMESE GENERALS ARE UNDEPENDABLE AS THEY ARE AFRAID OF LOSING THEIR PRIVILEGED
POSITIONS. HE ALSO CLAIMED THAT NGO DINH NHƯ WAS SIMILAR TO A COMMUNIST AS NHU
IS ALSO DEVIOUS, DISRESPECTFUL OF LEGALITY, AND WILL DO ANYTHING TO FURTHER HIS
OWN GOALS..

2. COLONEL THAO SAID THAT THE COUP D'ETAT GROUP TO WHICH HE BELONGS IS
PLANNING CAREFULLY AND MOVING CAUTIOUSLY TOWARD A COUP SINCE THEY WISH TO BE
REASONABLY CERTAIN OF SUCCESS. HE STATED THAT THE GROUP WILL TAKE ACTION WHEN
THE RIGHT COMBINATION OF UNITS IS ACHIEVED. HE CLAIMED THAT THE MOVEMENT OF
MILITARY UNITS TO SUPPORT AN ATTEMPTED COUP WAS GOING FAIRLY WELL AND THAT THE
GROUP WAS NOW TRYING TO OBTAIN THE SUPPORT OF THE ARMORED UNITS IN SAIGON, WHICH
WOULD MAKE A SUCCESSFUL: COUP MUCH EASIER TO ATTAIN AND WOULD CAUSE LESS BLOODSHED.
3.
THAO REMARKED THAT THE DEPARTURE OF TRAN KIM TUYEN, FORMER DIRECTOR OF
THE PRESIDENTIAL SECURITY SERVICE, FROM SOUTH VIETNAM WILL PROBABLY HAVE AN
ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE TUYEN GROUP COUP D'ETAT PLANNING, BUT MIGHT PROVE BENEFICIAL
TO THAO'S GROUP AS NGO DINH NHƯ MIGHT RELAX IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT ONE OF THE
GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM'S MOST DANGEROUS ENEMIES IS OUT OF THE WAY.
4.
:
THAO MAINTAINED THAT. THE GENERALS OF THE ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM
ARE UNDEPENDABLE; THEY CLAIM THAT THEY ARE AWAITING A POSITIVE INDICATION THAT THE
NGO FAMILY IS PLACING PRESERVATION OF THEIR OWN PERSONAL POWER ABOVE THAT OF THE
COUNTRY, AND/OR POSITIVE PROOF THAT NHU IS DEALING WITH THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF
VIETNAM. THAO REMARKED THAT THESE ARE MERELY EXCUSES AND THAT THE GENERALS ARE
AFRAID OF LOSING PRIVILEGED POSITIONS.
5.
THAO REMARKED THAT, IN HIS OPINION, NHU MIGHT THINK THAT HE CAN MAKE A
DEAL WITH THE COMMUNISTS AND END UP BY TRICKING THEM. THAO CLAIMED, HOWEVER, THAT
IF NHU ACTUALLY BELIEVES SUCH A THING, HE IS VERY MUCH MISTAKEN. THAO STATED THAT

NHU COMPARED WELL WITH HIGH-RANKING COMMUNISTS, BUT THAT HE MAKES UNILATERAL
DECISIONS WHILE THE COMMUNISTS MAKE DECISIONS ONLY AFTER DISCUSSIONS, THUS
PRECLUDING SERIOUS ERRORS. THAO SAID THAT, WHEN SPEAKING WITH NHU, HE HAS OFTEN
:.
FELT THAT HE WAS SPEAKING WITH A COMMUNIST SINCE NHU IS ALSO DEVIOUS, DISRESPECT-
FUL OF LEGALITY, AND WILL DO ANYTHING TO FURTHER HIS OWN GOALS.
6. THAO COMMENTED THAT NHU RECENTLY TOLD THAI LANG. NGHIEM, A CLOSE FRIEND
OF NHU, THAT HE WAS GOING TO DO SOMETHING SOON THAT WOULD BE VERY SURPRISING,
BUT THAT IT WAS TOO EARLY TO DIVULGE WHAT HE HAS IN MIND. THAO HAD NO IDEA WHAT
NHU HAD IN MIND, BUT SPECULATED THAT IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO DO WITH NORTH
VIETNAM.
