1. WALTER C. BADENDICK MET FOR OVER TWO HOURS WITH SON
OF WUCLASSIC/88 IN LOCAL RESTAURANT ON 9 OCT 78. MEETING WAS
EXTREMELY WARM AND FRIENDLY, WITH BOTH RECALLING VIGNETTES
AND ANECDOTES ABOUT WUCLASSIC/88 (C/88). SON WAS ENROUTE TO
AIRPORT TO FLY TO EAST COAST TO FINALIZE PURCHASE OF FARM
NEAR CHICO, CA., BUT WAS PLEASED TO TAKE TIME TO MEET BADENDICK
AND TALK ABOUT C/88. SON RELATED THAT C/88, ALTHOUGH ENORMOUSLY
TALENTED AND AT ONE TIME YOUNGEST MAJOR IN U.S. ARMY, HAD
MARRIED SECOND WIFE UNACCEPTABLE TO ARMY AND GAVE UP HIS CAREER
BECAUSE OF HIS RESPONSIBILITIES TO HER AND HIS CHILDREN (SON
WAS ONLY OFFSPRING FROM FIRST MARRIAGE). THIS LED TO LENGTHY
PERIOD WHICH SON DESCRIBED AS "PURE HELL" FOR C/88, DURING
WHICH HE WAS POOR, IN ILL HEALTH AND UNABLE TO UTILIZE HIS CON-
SIDERABLE TALENTS AS INTELLIGENCE OFFICER. DURING LAST EIGHTEEN
MONTHS OF ASSOCIATION WITH RTACTION, C/88 WAS ONCE AGAIN IN HIS
ELEMENT, WAS DOING PURPOSEFUL AND IMPORTANT WORK AND WAS FULFILLED
AT END OF HIS LIFE. SON IS VERY COGNIZANT OF THIS AND HAS VERY
GOOD FEELINGS TOWARD RTACTION BECAUSE OF IT. SON WAS INTIMATE
CONFIDANT OF C/88, WHO TOLD HIM HE HAD RTACTION MISSION IN
10 MONTEREY BUT DID NOT REVEAL TARGETS EVEN IN GENERAL, SAID NOTHING
OF MODUS OPERANDI, AND DID NOT IDENTIFY BADENDICK BEYOND BEING
UNNAMED RTACTION OFFICER POSING AS NEPHEW (THIS LAST IN CASE C/88
SHOULD DIE, SO SON WOULD BE PREPARED TO BACKSTOP BADENDICK AS
RELATIVE).
2. REGARDING C/88'S PLAN TO ASSASSINATE CASTRO, SON SAID
IT WAS WRITTEN MANY YEARS AGO IN FLORIDA AT TIME WHEN SON IS
ABSOLUTELY SURE C/88 HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH RTACTION. IN FACT,
SAID SON, HE DOES NOT THINK PLAN WAS DRAWN UP AT ANYONE'S BEHEST,

BUT RATHER THAT C/88 HAD DISCUSSED GENERAL CUBAN SITUATION
WITH SOME ACQUAINTANCES AND THEN HAD ON HIS OWN INITIATIVE
WRITTEN UP PLAN. SON REMEMBERS SEEING PLAN WHEN
HE MOVED C/88 TO MONTEREY IN MAY 78, BUT IT WAS NOT AMONG PERSONAL
EFFECTS. HE SPECULATED THAT PERHAPS C/88 HAD DESTROYED IT.
BADENDICK NOTED THAT, ALTHOUGH RTACTION HAD NEITHER INVOLVEMENT
NOR KNOWLEDGE OF PLAN, IT COULD BE SUBJECT TO MISINTERPRETATION
IF IT EVER BECAME PUBLIC AND WERE ASSOCIATED WITH RTACTION.
SAID IF PLAN SHOULD TURN UP HE WILL EITHER DESTROY IT OR MAKE
SURE IT REMAINS HIS PRIVATE PROPERTY; HE IS AWARE OF UNDESERVED
HARM IT COULD DO TO INNOCENT RTACTION.
3. SON SAID THAT APARTMENT MANAGER HAD CONTACTED HIM TO SAY
THAT THE LOST RANDALL KNIFE HAD BEEN FOUND IN WEEDS OUTSIDE
APARTMENT AND WOULD BE RETURNED TO SON. HE IS SURE THAT MANAGER
IS PERSON GUILTY OF STEALING C/88'S PERSONAL EFFECTS, BUT HE IS
SATISFIED NOW THAT HE HAD KNIFE BACK AND IS PREPARED TO FORGET
THE OTHER MISSING ITEMS.
4. SON WAS UNABLE TO AGAIN LOCATE (MAZAHERI THESIS, WHICH HE
BELIEVES WAS DESTROYED BY ONE OF C/88'S DAUGHTER'S. HE HAD NO
OBJECTION TO BADENDICK CONTACTING (MAZAHERI POSING AS NEPHEW TO
EXPLAIN LOSS OF THESIS AND SAID HE WOULD BACKSTOP BADENDICK TO
MAZAHERI) AS COUSIN IF EVER ASKED. HE VOLUNTEERED TO CALL MAZAHERI
(WHOSE NAME HE DOES NOT KNOW), IDENTIFY HIMSELF AS SON, AND
INTRODUCE BADENDICK AS COUSIN, WHICH OFFER BADENDICK DECLINED
WITH THANKS.
5. PARTING WAS VERY AMICABLE, WITH SON EXPRESSING HOPE THEY
COULD MEET AGAIN FOR ANOTHER CHAT SOMETIME. WISH REITERATE
PARA 8 REF. ANTICIPATE NO FURTHER SECURITY CONCERNS IN THIS
CASE.
