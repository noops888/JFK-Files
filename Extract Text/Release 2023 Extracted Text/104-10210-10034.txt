VI. Production
A. Positive Intelligence Information
NOSENKO's positive intelligence production has been
meager, and nothing he reported serited dissemination as an
intelligence report. According to his biography, NOSENKO'S
entire adult life until defecting had been spent either as
a student or as an intelligence officer, and in explanation
of his lack of positive intelligence information, he has
stressed that since the early 1950's he had few outside
interests and "no real contacts" outside the KGB itself.*
NOSENKO's assignments to the Soviet delegations to the
Disarmament Conference in 1962 and 1964 were, he has said,
for cover purposes only, and he neither had any connections
with officials or organizations in the USSR concerned with
arms control or disarmament policies nor did he take any
part in the substantive work of the delegations.
During the period 18 to 23 February 1964, a wide range
of questions covering various aspects of nuclear weapons,
missiles, electronics, communications, unconventional wea-
pons, military industry, military units and equipment, and
research and development were put to NOSENKO in order to
evaluate his knowledgeability. He had no direct knowledge
of any of these topics, although he was able to identify in
general a few of the KGB organizations which protect sensi-
tive installations such as nuclear weapons production and
storage sites. NOSENKO was given a set of requirements
from the Defense Intelligence Agency on 24 February 1964.
These questions were premised on his two TDY tours to the
Disarmament Conferences in Geneva; they dealt with such
matters as Soviet underground testing, Soviet efforts and
progress in the fields of chemical and biological warfare,
Soviet aims and purposes at the disarmament talks, and
Soviet views of the corresponding attitudes and intentions
of the United States. NOSENKO stated he had no information
on any of these questions but expressed his personal opinion
on a few of them, in general terms. NOSENKO's answers to
other questions of a positive intelligence nature--those
concerning the viability of the current Soviet leadership.
plans for a new Soviet constitution, anti-Semitism as
governmental policy, personality data on Soviet leaders,
and other political and social matters--were couched in vague
and general terms and were not based on concrete knowledge.
*At the start of his first meeting with CIA on 9 June 1962,
however, when explaining how he knew of the real state of
affairs inside the USSR (as opposed to that presented by
Soviet propaganda), NOSENKO said: "I circulate among
ministers, with the friends of my father, and I hear
what they say."

B. Soviet Intelligence Personalities
As indicated in the accompanying tabulation, NOSENKO
has provided information on a total of approximately 1,000
Soviet citizens who are staff employees of, or have other-
wise been affiliated with, Soviet intelligence and security
organizations. At the time NOSENKO defected, 64 of these--
51 officers and 13 agents or contacts--were abroad. Of the
51 officers then abroad, 41 were already known or suspected
of being Soviet intelligence officers.

*OF NOSENKO's information on 435 Second Chief Directorate
staff employees, 47 had been identified previously as KGB
officers. Another 140 were identified by NOSENKO only by
last name, and he could provide no additional information
which might identify them further; most of these names were
of persons engaged in strictly internal economic, industrial
and political security activities. Of the remaining 248,
NOSENKO's information on the majority of them is inadequate
for identification purposes if they should travel abroad.

In sum, of the 37 First Chief Directorate personnel

the time of his defection or have come abroad since.
*There are, however, some conflicts between the reports by
NOSENKO and those by other Soviet sources on the KGB organi-
zational elements or specialties with which certain of these
officers (as well as some in the Second Chief Directorate)
are associated. As with Second Chief Directorate personali-
ties, the notation "previous identifications" does not in-
clude those from any Soviet sources subsequent to GOLITSYN.

Structure and Functions
Prior to NOSENKO's contact with CIA in June 1962, the
most recent information on KGB structure and functions had
been provided by GOLITSYN, whose information was current as
of December 1961 when he defected. GOLITSYN's data and that
from the Polish defector GOLENIEWSKI were the first detailed
new information on this subject available to the U.S. intel-
ligence community since 1954, when DERYABIN, RASTVOROV,
PETROV, and KHOKHLOV defected, just prior to the change-over
from the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) to the Committee
for State Security (KGB). GOLENIEWSKI and GOLITSYN had re-
ported on the 1959 reorganization of the KGB, the first major
realignment of the KGB's functions since the abolition of
the Committee for Information in 1951. It encompassed the
absorption into the Second Chief Directorate of the duties of
the former Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Directorates, which had
been responsible for political, economic-industrial, and
transportation security, respectively, It also included the
upgrading of the Illegals Department to the status of a
Special Directorate within the First Chief Directorate, the
consolidation of counterintelligence operations abroad into
one new department, the Fourteenth, and creation of a new
department--Department "D" (Disinformation)--to.coordinate
and intensify the KGB's activities in the area of deception
and misinformation. The latter, although placed in the First
Chief Directorate, was established to serve the needs of the
entire KGB,
NOSENKO'S 1964 information on the organization and func-
tions of the KGB indicated refinements of responsibilities
in the Second Chief Directorate in accordance with the 1959
absorption of the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Directorates.
The formation of the so-called "Service" (Sluzhba) as a
component of the Second Chief Directorate centralized those
political security functions (formerly handled by the Fourth
Directorate) which were unrelated to foreigners in the USSR;
the creation of an element entitled "the Directorate" (Uprav-
leniye) accomplished the same thing for industrial-economic
functions formerly managed by the Fifth and Sixth Directorates.
As for the First Chief Directorate, NOSENKO reported the up-
grading of the Scientific and Technical Department to direc-
torate status, and the expansion of the Information and
Counterintelligence Departments to Service: Number1" and "Ser-
vice Number 2," respectively; according to NOSENKO, the
latter organizational designation permits an increase in
personnel without a corresponding rise in the bureaucratic
level of the component.
The accompanying charts offer a comparison of the or-
ganization of the KGB in 1961, as known from GOLITSYN (and
supported by GOLENIEWSKI), and in 1964, as given by NOSENKO.
Comments on particular weaknesses in NOSENKO's information
on the KGB organization since its formation in 1954 will be
found in Part VII.B.1., Statements of DERYABIN.

2. Modus Operandi
Less measurable or precise in comparison with KGB
structure and functions are the operational methods and
Headquarters procedures of the KGS.
NOSENKO himself has not
been as productive in revealing Tourist Department methods
as was the document which he provided on this subject in
1964. He has not been able to provide a systematic, detailed,
or documented review of the methods of the other Second Chief
Directorate component to which he was assigned, the U.S.
Embassy Sectior, nor of the methods of the Surveillance
Directorate with which he worked closely.
less has furnished insights into the U.S. Embassy Section
and Surveillance Directorate methods in the course of dis-
cussing specific operations.
NOSENKO neverthe-
It went on to
NOSENKO brought to the Geneva meetings in 1964 a draft
of a report to the Collegium of the KGB dated March 1963 on
the work of the fourist Department of the Second Chief Direc-
torate. He claimed to nave written it himself, and it bore
corrections in his handwriting. This draft described KGB
investigations of and operations against Western tourists
suspected of being agents of foreign intelligence services,
primarily in the period of 1961-1962.
cite statistics on the number of foreign tourists visiting
the USSR, and the number of foreign agent suspects uncovered
among them through the work of the KСв. A wide variety of
techniques used by the Tourist Department were mentioned,
with examples of certain successes interspersed in the
discussion. On the basis of the detail on techniques and
modus operandi set forth in this report, CIA prepared the
Study entitled 'KGB Work Against Foreign Tourists" which was
disseminated to the U.S. intelligence community in June 1964.
Aside from the case examples which were added as illustrative
materiai, derived from the many reports from Americans who
were targets of such KGB operational activity, this study
drew almost exclusively on the material discussed in the
NOSENKO document. The study received high evaluations from
all recipients.
:
NOSENKO has made numerous references to the techniques
described in this report, as discussed in the many cases
reviewed in detail in the foregoing treatment of his KGB
career. When interviewed for further information on the
statistics which appear throughout the 1963 draft, however,
NOSENKO was unable to identify the operations referred to in
the numerical citations, nor those included as illustrative

exception was the example of the use of the concealed trans-
mitter "N-EKSTRA" in the Restaurant Praga to monitor an
attempt by an American intelligence officer to recruit a dip-
lomat of one of the neutral countries; this was identified
by NOSENKO as the incident involving the Indonesian military
attache ONGKO, discussed in detail in Part VI.D.7.b.*

other occasions, when the report was not available to hi
NOSENKO could not provide as much detail on Second Chief
Directorate operational techniques and methods as is con-
tained in the written report.
The document refers also to the role of the leadership
of the Tourist Department in briefing other organs of the
KGB on work against foreign tourists. NOSENKO was questioned
on this activity but ould not recall any information contained
in such lectures or discussions. Although the document also
emphasized the daily need for coordination of the Tourist
Department activities with numerous other components of KGB
Headquarters and with local organs of the KGB throughout the
Soviet Union, NOSENKO was unable to explain how such coordina-
tion was effected in practice, nor could he describe require-
ments for the preparation and approval of correspondence
pertaining to such coordination; in many instances he asserted
that telephone calls sufficed, but he said he could not indi-
cate who was authorized to coordinate informally in this way.
:
Apart from this information on Tourist Department modus
operandi, NOSENKO has described the operational methods of
the U.S. Embassy Section of the American Department and of
the Surveillance Directorate in connection with their coordinated
activities against Embassy targets. Of particular note is
Part V.E.3.c., in discussions of operations against Embassy
code clerks.
3. Staff Procedures
In recounting verious operations in which he participated
or which he supervised, NOSENKO described operations and
events which encompassed various KGB procedures. Some of
these were: authorization for recruitment; file checks;
correspondence and coordination with other KGB departments,
directorates, or regional units; technical support of opera-
tions; administration of safe houses; KGB files and reports;
and travel authorizations and accountings. He was from time
to time asked to describe such procedures systematically and
in detail.
derive any detailed picture of current KGB procedures. The
little NOSENKO was able to provide did not differ from infor-
mation dated 1954, and was only a small fraction of the infor-
mation available from earlier sources. He had no information
on changes or developments in the interim. Examples of the
level of NOSENKO's knowledge of certain procedures may be
found in Part VII.B.1, DERYADIN'S Comments, as may instances
of inaccurate reporting of procedures.
From such questioning it was not possible to

D. KGB Activities
1. Operations Against Americans
In the context of KGB recruitment operations and investigations,
NOSENKO has mentioned 111 Americans: Forty-nine of them were said
to have been recruited, 33 were under development, and seven re-
fused to collaborate with the KGB; investigations of nearly all
the remaining 22 Americans were reportedly predicated on KGB sus-
picion or knowledge of their affiliation with U.S. Intelligence.
Of the 49 Americans recruited, NOSENKO attributed his knowl-
edge of nine of them to his own direct, personal involvement in
the approaches, usually as recruiting officer; these cases are
discussed at greater length in connection with NOSENKO'S KGB
career (Part V. His knowledge of 11 other recruitments was said
to have derived from either indirect involvement or contact with
the targets of these operations; NOSENKO indicated that he be-
came aware of these 11 persons through his duties at various times
in the Americas and Tourist Departments of the KGB Second Chief
Directorate. Because of interest in American correspondents
during 1954 and 1955 while in the American Department, for exam-
ple, he was able to report that five of them were KGB agents, al-
though he had taken no part in their recruitments, which had been
achieved earlier; likewise, he learned of two recruitments when
an American Department officer twice visited the Tourist Depart-
ment with a request for operational assistance during 1962 and
1963, when NOSENKO was a Deputy Chief of this department.)
In
four cases--all First Chief Directorate operations--NOSENKO said
he learned of the recruitments unofficially from discussions with
friends and from remarks by other case officers which he over-
heard. Two of these four cases were considered by NOSENKO to be
among his most significant information, the penetration of the
Orly Courier Transfer Station by U.S. Army Sgt. Robert Lee JOHN-
SON and the recruitment in Moscow and later handling of code-
machine mechanic Dayle W. SMITH; detailed information on the
JOHNSON and SMITH cases is presented after the tabulation (below)
of NOSENKO's American leads.
NOSENKO has provided no sources for his information on 25
of the 49 successful KGB recruitment operations against Ameri-
cans, although he has sometimes identified the case officers in-
volved in them; most of this information was contained in handwritten
notes, which NOSENKO carried to Geneva in 1964. According to NOSENKO,
he learned of these cases casually while Deputy Chief of the Tour-
ist Department during 1962 and 1963; many of the recruitments were
said to have been accomplished in 1960 and 1961 at a time when
NOSENKO was serving in the American Department. He has explained
these notes as follows: "If I did not participate in a case, I
don't know much about it. Please understand me. Since 1962 when
I first began to get ready for this act (defection), any time I
got a whiff of something which smelled like an agent, I would put
it down. I have a regular safe in my office and then I have a
hidden wall safe. There I may put my personal papers, notes. I
am the only one who has a key and any little notes, like those I
mentioned, I would put in there."

The tabulation below presents NOSENKO's American case leads
under the categories of successful recruitment approaches, de-
velopment operations, unsuccessful recruitment approaches, and
KGB investigations, in that order. Within each of these cate-
gories, the tabulation summarizes NOSENKO's information, his
sourcing and the year he reported the lead to CIA, and the re-
sults of investigations of the NOSENKO leads by U.S. and other
Western security services. As indicated in the tabulation, cer-
tain cases are discussed in greater detail elsewhere in this
paper.

This tabulation also includes one agent, John A. SHUBIN, who
