following character sketch on Hector GALLO Portieles, First
Secretary of the Cuban Embassy in La Paz:
GALLO, who arrived in Bolivia in March 1962, gives the
impression of being a capable and dynamic worker, with a nervous
personality. He is the person in charge of giving scholarships
to Cuba. It is said that this job was created by Fidel CASTRO
in answer to a request by the Avanzada Universitaria (University
group of the official government party). He is seen frequently
at the University of La Paz and has many friends among the
students. GALLO does not spend much time with the other Cuban
diplomats. He is in frequent contact with the leaders of the
Communist Youth, and spends a good deal of time in the labor
and other union organizations. He is also in contact with the
Trotskyist organizations, and makes many trips into the interior
of Bolivia which usually do not last more than six days. GALLO
meets the Cuban diplomatic couriers on their arrival in La Paz,
and it is said that his correspondence is sent separately from
the regular Embassy correspondence to Cuba. He is the most
active of the Cuban diplo: ats in La Paz.
7. On 9 March 1963, according to a usually reliable source, Hector GALLO

and his family departed Mexico for Habana.
8. An untested source who was a former member of the Cuban Ministry of
Foreign Relations reported the following information on Hector
Pascual GALLO Portiles in a report dated 28 January 1963:
GALLO is the First Secretary of the Cuban Embassy in La Paz,
Bolivia. He received his appointment because his brother is an
important Communist in the Castro regime. GALLO may have been a
member of the Foreign Service before the revolution. He is not
very intelligent. His wife is anti-Communist.
