MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
FROM:
Edmund Cohen
Assistant General Counsel
OGC 77-0427
19 January 1977
SUBJECT:
03
Thomas L. Briggs Involvement as Witness in
Gerald Patrick Hemming Case
03
1. In the late afternoon on 7 January 1977, Mr. T Thomas L. Briggs
informed the undersigned that he was being asked to attend a pre-trial
conference on 10 January in Miami, Florida, and expected to be a witness
for the Government in the case against Gerald Patrick Hemming. Mr.
Briggs stated that he had been under cover while employed by the Agency
from 1969 to 1974. He had then transferred to DEA where he became involved
with Mr. Hemming. Mr. Brigg was now back with the Agency and expected
to be put under cover very shortly. Both for cover considerations and
because he felt the Hemming case had a great deal of "flap" potential,
rivaling the Werbell case, he desired OGC to intercede for him to keep him
from having to testify.
03
2. Mr. Briggsnoted that Hemming was a "walk-in", who was referred
to his boss at DEA, Mr. Conein, by Mr. Werbell and that Conein, in turn,
had sent Hemming to him to be interviewed. Subsequently, Mr. Hemming
had "set up" Mr. Conein by first telling him that a brother wished to work
with DEA and requesting permission to give Mr. Conein a resume, and later
by publicly meeting Conein and handing him a manila envelope ostensibly
containing the promised resume. In fact, the envelope contained a report
with phony cryptonyms representing Hemming as an agent of Conein's.
Hemming's report detailed a variety of alleged official activities and 3
mentioned his prior contacts with Conein and with (Briggs). (Briggs indicated
that Hemming would undoubtedly try to beat the narcotics charges pending
against him in Miami by claiming to be a DEA or CIA agent. Briggs
testimony that he was a DEA employee when he met him but was a CIA
employee both before and after would help cloud the issue. In addition,
such exposure could affect (Briggs current usefulness to the Agency.
03
3. The undersigned checked with Mr. Robert Blandford, CCS, and
learned that Briggs cover had been removed when he left the Agency, thus
his previous service was a matter of public record. In addition, he was not
now under cover. Mr. senstead C/CCS, opined that no cover problem
existed which would impede Briggs) testimony.
03
4. The undersigned then spoke with Ms. Karen Atkinson, Assistant
U.S. Attorney in Miami (305) 350-5461, to inform her of Mr. Briggs) current
status. Ms. Atkinson appreciated the potential problems, but concluded that
Mr. Briggs) would be a necessary witness for the trial which was scheduled
to begin on 11 January. The question of travel expenses was also broached.
Ms. Atkinson stated that she did not have an expense fund to pay the travel
expenses of Government witnesses and that the usual practice was for the
employer Agency to pay the expenses of an employee testifying on behalf of
the Government about his official actions. The instant case was somewhat
unusual because CIA would be paying for Mr. (Briggs) to, in effect, testify
about his DEA experiences, but she opined that this was a matter best
resolved in Washington.
03
03 5. In view of the limited time available, the undersigned informed Mr.
Briggs branch branch chief, (1 Hope Mason of the above and suggested that travel
orders be cut for Mr. Briggs) trip to Miami.
03
03
6. On 11 January, following his return from Miami, Mr. (Briggs)
informed the undersigned that Hemming's motion that his trial be severed
from that of his various co-conspirators had been granted and, therefore,
his testimony had not been required. Ms. Atkinson had informed him that
should Hemming raise as a defense the allegation that he was a DEA agent,
03 Briggs) would be called as a rebuttal witness. Ms. Atkinson also noted
that Hemming was alleging that DEA was representing him at the behest
of CIA because in the past he had "crossed" CIA.
