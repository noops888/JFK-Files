turn to is Bronson Tweedy, who in 1960 and 1961, as I am
sure you will recall, was the Chief of the African Division.
He indicated to us in his testimony that he had a number of
talks with you, probably in the summer or fall of 1960,
9
where the prospect of assassinating Lumumba wae raised.

What can you tell us about those discussions?
Mr. Bissell.
I am afraid I can't tell you anything.
11
I don't remember the specific discussions with him.
It seems

to me, however, entirely to be expected that such conversa-
tions took place.

I think I testified previously, but in any

elimination of Lumumba.
And since that was in the Africa
area, I think it most unlikely that I would have done that
without saying something to the Division Chief about it.
Mr. Baron. Mr. Tweedy's testimony was to the effect
that he was in fact not being informed of some on-going
operation or some instruction that was contemplated, but
rather that you and he were discussing the feasibility of
assassinating Lumumba.
Did such discussions take place?

I don't happen to remember them, but
it seems to me entirely probable that they did. And if he
said so I would certainly accept that.

cussions took place they would have taken place in the summer
or fall of 19607

Yes.

Would such discussions have involved planning
for an actual assassination mission?

Mr. Baron. Would planning discussions in the sense
that you are using the term included sending instruments of
assassination to the Congo?

don't happen to remember that. I am aware, I think, that
there is a record that something was said, but I had no
recollection that things went that far. But that still could
have been included in what I mean by the term "planning and
preparing".
Mr. Baron. Did you give Mr. Tweedy any specific
instruction as to steps he was to take to further a plan
to assassinate Lumumba?
Mr. Bissell. I may have. I don't remember them. The

only clear recollection I have is of what I think was
the initial discussion on this matter that I had with Justin
O'Donnell. And I believe that he and I had that alone, in
other words, that Mr. Tweedy was not present in the dis-
cussion I had with O'Donnell.
Mr. Baron. We will turn later to filling out the
details of your conversation with Justin O'Donnell.
For the moment, sticking with Mr. Tweedy's testimony,
he also testified that during this same period of time he
composed cables that went to the Chief of Station in Leopold-
ville inquiring at to if the Chief of Station could gain access

from the African Division, or might they more likely have
gone on a restricted basis from yourself to the Station
Chief without

have been the latter, although given the fact of conversations
with the Division Chief, presumably he would have been on the
distribution for these cables. But probably it would have

Mr.Baron. It was Mr. Tweedy's testimony that although
he composed such cables, they went out, as far as he could
recall, under your signature or from your office.
Mr. Bissell.
That would be a very normal procedure.
Mr. Baron. Do you recall discussing with Mr. Tweedy
the fact that he should write such cables, whether or not you
recall the specific cables?
Mr. Bissell. I really don't.
Mr. Baron. Mr. Tweedy also testified that the cable

traffic that he was sending to the Congo was part of a back and
forth communication in which he was receiving information from
17
the chief of Station in Leopoldville about the kind of

access that he could gain to Lumumba.
19
Did you read such cables from the Chief of Station in
20
Leopoldville?

Mr. Bissell. I am sure I did.

specifically.

Mr. Wides. Do you recall the question of access

since I am clear that at least in the case of O'Donnell, and
I now presume in the case of Mr. Tweedy, I authorized and
indeed directed this planning and preparatory activity.
A

major part of this would have been a search for ways in
which access could be gained.

Mr. Baron. And what kind of access were you looking

for at that time?

this would have been access to Lumumba for the purpose of
assassinating him rather than snatching him from U.N. custody?
Mr. Bissell. Well, it could have been for the pur-
pose really of eliminating him from his thenpolitical thenpolitical acti-
vities. And that could have been assassination, or it
could have involved some form of incapacitation, or it could
possibly have been, in your words, snatching him so
that he could be put into the custody of what we regarded
as friendly authorities.
Mr. Baron. Would you have sought information from
the Chief of Station on whether he could gain access to

Lumumba for the purpose of poisoning Lumumba.
Mr. Bissell. It could very well have. That was one
2
method of elimination, and that was obviously thought about
at the time as part of the planning, and almost certainly
4
we would have been in touch with the Chief of Station to see
5
if he could gain access for that purpose.

Mr. Baron.
Were you also in touch with the Chief of

Mr. Bissell. I would guess that really the questions
to the Chief of Station would have had to do with gaining access
an access that could be used for
for whatever method
whatever method of eliminating Lumumba might be simple,
practical and workable. And I doubt if the question would
have been a different one, depending on the device or weapon
to be used.

Mr. Baron. To retrace something you said a moment
ago, if Mr. Tweedy had authored cables seeking information
from the Chief of Station in Leopoldville about gaining
access to Lumumba, you would have approved such cables?
Mr. Bissell.
Yes, I would most certainly have.
Excuse me. Let me elaborate on that.
21
Given the procedures and relationships in effect, I
22
think Mr. Tweedy, on the basis of an oral authorization from
27
me, would have had the authority to send such a cable without
24
my signing off on it. But in a matter of this sensitivity

I think it highly likely that he would have drafted the
cable, initialed it and sent it to my office for dispatch.
Mr. Baron. And you wouldn't dispute his testimony that
he did so?
Mr. Bissell. Oh, no. His testimony seemed to me to be
absolutely consistent with my recollections, which, alas,
are somewhat inform. infirm?
Mr. Baron. Would your discussions with Mr. Tweedy have
involved discussing the possibility of poisoning Lumumba?
Mr. Bissell. I suppose so.
Mr. Baron. We have also taken testimony from the man
who was Chief of Station in Leopoldville during this period of
time, from mid-summer of 1960 throughout 1961, and he testified--
Mr. Bissell. Would you remind me who it was?
Mr. Baron. Off the record for a moment.

Senator Hart of Colorado.
Back on the record.
Mr. Baron. While we were off the record we explained
the arrangement under which the Chief of Station would
testify before the Committee under alias. And we will refer
to him here today as the Chief of Station, or by his alias,
which is that of Victor Hedgman.
Mr. Bissell, when the Chief of Station testified before
us he indicated that at some point in the late summer or
early fall of 1960 probably toward the latter part of August

Mr. Bissell. They may be there, but in any event, the
releasing signiature is definitely his.
If I may complete the answer to your question, for the
reason I have given you, my surmise is that I was not

would you be apprised of it upon your return to headquarters?

not say that. Assuming that he had assumed the position

I very probably would have consulted with him.
11
Mr. Wides. For the record, while he was science advisor

14
to the DDP, was he also an official of the TSD component,
or was that a separate

What would have been the substance of those discussions?
Mr. Bissell. It would have been discussing with him
possible weapons or other means to use. When he was my

with the Technical Services Division, the person who had
been a member of it. And he knew the personnel and he knew
a great deal about their programs.

Mr. Baron.
Did you have any other kinds of discussions

with Sidney Gottlieb about the assassination of Lumumba?

Mr. Bissell.
None that I remember.

Mr. Baron.
Did you discuss with Mr. Gottlieb your

conversations with Justin O'Donnell?
5
Mr. Bissell. I just have no recollection of that.

Mr. Baron. Did Mr. Gottlieb come to you and report to

assassination of Lumumba?

Did Mr. Gottlieb make you aware that he had
in his shop, or he knew how to obtain the means to assassin-

Mr. Bissell. Well, I certainly was aware in a general
way that various means were available in the Technical
Services Division. I don't know whether I obtained that
information specifically from Mr. Gottlieb, but probably I
did obtain some of it through him.

you were aware that the means were available to assassinate
Lumumba?
Mr. Bissell. I think you put it too specifically.
The
I was aware that as part of it is on-going activity.
Technical Services Division did a lot of work in the develop-

ment of various weapons of a sort appropriate for a clandes-
tine service. And I was aware, I am quite certain, that
these included poisons, type of firearms, and a whole range

of capabilities.
But my belief today, and my recollection,

is that I was aware of these as the products, I repeat, of
5
an on-going development program which itself was not targetted

at any type individual or operation.

Mr. Baron. And with whom did you have discussions of
technical means that might be used to assassinate Lumumba

Mr. Bissell.
I do not know. I could have had with

Mr. Roosevelt, whom I think was still the head of the Techni-
cal Division. I don't believe it would have been any but
those two.
14
Mr. Baron.
This would be Cornelius Roosevelt?
15
Mr. Bissell.
That is correct.
16
Mr. Baron.
Did Mr. Gottlieb express to you his
17
reluctance to participate in an assassination plan?
18
Mr. Bissell.
I don't ever remember his so doing.
19
Mr. Baron.
Did Mr. Gottlieb appear to be willing to
20
21
see what he could do to obtain or develop the means to be
used in such a plan?
22
Mr. Bissell. I really don't have any recollection that
23
would enable me to answer that. I do believe that
if
24
he had demurred strongly, and urged its abandonment, or

opposed it, I think it is likely that I would have remembered
that position on his part, because I do remember very clearly
Justin O'Donnell's reaction. And since I don't remember

any such negative reaction from Mr. Gottlieb, my inference is
that there probably was none.

Mr. Baron. The Chief of Station in Leopoldville at

September he received a visit from Sidney Gottlieb in the
Congo.
Did you sent Mr. Gottlieb to the Congo at that time?

Probably, if he went there, I certainly
