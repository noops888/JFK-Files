AMTURVY OPERATION

1. The AMTURVY Operation was designed for the
purpose of conducting sabotage operations against Cuba.
It consisted of a net of 13 AMTURVY assets whose primary
function, apart from sabotage, was the preparation of
target studies and analysis of sabotage operations. The
files contain only one reference to assassination, that
in 1963 and the continuation of the same plan through to
1965. Based on a review of the files, it is apparent
that the following assassination plan could have been known to
the Cubans, including the overall purpose of the AMTURVY
Operation.

ASSASSINATION PLAN
AMTURVY-13.
AMTURVY-13 (Mario SALABARRIA) was closely
acquainted with Fidel Castro as far back as 1947 and there is some
some indication that they both may have been involved in the
1947 plan to topple the Trujillo Government in the Dominican
Republic. However, in 1948, SALABARRIA was responsible for
the arrest of Fidel Castro, this due to the latters agitation
on behalf of one Emilio TRO. Salabarria was later sentenced
to 30 years in prison for having murdered TRO/ He remained
in prison until 1961 when he appealed for parole to one
Lionel SOTO Prieto (201-055332). As Salabarria had once
saved Soto's life, the latter appealed the case to Raul
Castro. Salabarria was subsequently released from prison
in February, 1961. The terms of his release from jail
are unknown.

By the summer of 1963 Salabarria was seeking
weapons and funds for a proposed assassination attempt against
13-00000

(ENRIQUE DIPZ FERNANDEZ)
Fidel Castro. Through his confidant, AMTURVY-44 Salabarria
sought contact with AMTURVY- Salabarria had known AMTURVY-1's
brother, AMCONCERT-1 for twenty years and assumed that ANTURVY-1
was in touch with the AGENCY (Chowass assumed this is unknown).
At his first meeting with AMTURVY-1, in the summer of 1963,
Salabarria said he was a member of a group plotting Castro's
death, and needed money and weapons in order to carry out
the plan (AMCROAK-1 was also a member of this group). In
return for this assistance, Salabarria offered to carry out
minor sabotage operations for AMTURVY-1's "American contacts"
(how he knew of these "contacts" is unknown, unless ANTURVY-1
told him).
4.
In October 1963, when the Agency was satisfied
with Salabarria's bona fides "we" (the Agency ) managed to
get a few pistols, revolvers, and sabotage materials into
Salabarria's hands, through AMTURVY-4. At this time AMTURVY - 4
was receiving materials from the Agency through the pouch of
the (Spanish) Embassy in Havana. AMTURVY-4 was being assisted
in this matter by QUANTUM-51) Whether or not the materials
for Salabarrias assassination plan came through the (Spanish)
pouch is unknown.
The following is an excerpt from UFGA 19214,
of 28 December 1964, the debriefing of AMTURVY-1 who was
successfully exfiltrated from Cuba in October 1964: (See 484

6. By early 1964, however, the Agency had become
dissatisfied with Salabarria and his proposed assassination
plan, and had notified the AMTURVY net (in particular
AMTURVY-1, AMTURVY-4, and AMCROAK-1) to cease working on
the assassination idea. Salabarria's later attempt to
assassinate Fidel Castro was not approved by the Agency,
and he was in fact informed of the Agency's opposition
to his plan.
7. COMMENTS
If as the file shows, the Agency approved
of Salabarria's plan to assassinate Fidel Castro and provided
Salabarria with the weapons (this in October of 1963), Castro
could have been aware of the plan, especially as Salabarria's
case presents certain CI considerations. Salabarria had been
released from jail following a personal appeal through Raul
Castro; and this when Fidel Castro was well aware of the
fact that Salabarria was responsible for the death of a
close friend, Emilio TRO; not to mention the fact that
Salabarria was responsible for Castro's arrest in 1948.
What deal, if any, was made with Salabarria in return for
his release from jail is unknown. Nonetheless, Fidel
Castro has a recorded history of not being one to forgive,
especially when he has been affected personally as was the
case with Mario Salabarria.
