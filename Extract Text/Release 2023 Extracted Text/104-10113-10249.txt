4. It is expected that the passport will be used for short ter
travel only, which it is to be returned to AD/AB. Should further
identical need exist for this document beyond that time, it must be
recalled that the expiration date is 7 March 1959 and that
revalidaties are needed from that time forward. Any such revalidation
would have to be entered by Σ/ΛΑ. Also, use of this passport for travel
other than that originally intended (direct from U.S. to Argentina and back
within the same month) will require careful scrutiny by Σ/AD of the situation
at the time of the intended future travel.
