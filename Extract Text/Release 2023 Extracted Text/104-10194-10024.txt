-
1. This momorandum contains a recommendation in para-
graph & for the approval of the Deputy Director for Support.
2. Terence 8. CRABANAC (F) is a Contract Employee as
signed to the Madrid area in Spain in a sensitive assignment
since his conversion from a Staff Baployee on 4 July 1965.
CHABANAC was a G3-15, stop 7 ($19,880.00 per annus) and be
is being paid at the same rate in Na present contract
status. His contract provides that he will be entitled to
a living quartero allowance in conformance with regulations
of this organization applicable to its appointed personnel.
3. The basic living quarters allowance for Class II
officers in Madrid is $2,900 per annus. The house which
CRABANAC has located, with a one year lease from 15 November
1965 to 14 November 1966, has an annual rent of $6,600.00
excluding utilitios. Therefore, for rent alone, he will be
$1,960.00 per year over the 160 percent maximus allowed
under the provisions of FE 45-10b. On a 75/25 percent
sharing besis of the 60 percent over the quarters allowance,
he would be out of pocket $8,395.00.
4. Due to the operational sensitivity of CRABANAC'S
assignment, his request formlief on his housing costs was
handled by Mr. Thomas Kansies, A. On 15 September
1005, Ur. Xaranossines, ADDF, approved his being reimbursed
on a 78/33 percent basis for the excess allowable costs up
to, but not to exceed, 60 percent above his quarters allowance.
This authorization was included in a letter to CRABANAC from
Mr. Karasossines. It is requested that the Deputy Director
for Support authorize the 75/35 percent sharing of the exces
allovable costs up to 60 percent above his quarters allowance,

2. Mr. Hunt's quarters allowance is $2,900. Using
the same formula as applied to the other staff employees
at the Station, the following would be the figures:
$2,900 + 60% ($1,740) - $4,640
On a 50/50 percent sharing basis of the 60 percent, he
would be out-of-pocket $870 if his costs were $4,6-10.
On a 75/25 percent sharing basis of the 60 percent, he
would be out-of-pocket $435, if his costs were $4,640.
3. I would recommend he be authorized the 75/25 per-
cent sharing basis of the allowable excess costs up to,
but not to exceed, 50 percent above his quarters allowance.

A. OGC Opinion 65-2476a, dated 12 August 1965
B. Our Memo, dated 8 July 1965, Same Subject
1. This office herein recommends an ammendment to CRABANAC's
Supplement dated 4 July 1965, to delete paragraph 7. entitled "Offset."
: 2. This office acknowledges the OGC opinion, Reference A, which
determined CRABANAC may retain without Agency salary offset any future
royalties earned as a result of his literary efforts based on the fact
cover does not include role of a writer.
3. As Subject's cover "activities" have been officially clarified
as being only a light one of a retired Foreign Service Officer for
which the Agency will be making all entitlement payments and actually
he will receive no funds from any cover, this paragraph, which is misleading,
has no meaning in Subject's contract and it is hereby recommended that
it be deleted from CPABANAC's Supplement.
4. Further, in future cases when a cover is so light that Subject
will not be receiving funds from cover it is recommended that no "Offset"
paragraph be included in Supplements or Contracts.

Terence S. CRABANAC Retention of
Royalties by a Contract Employee
:
1. You have requested the opinion of this Office in regard to
the retention of future royalties which might be earned by Terence S.
CRABANAC as a result of his literary efforts. We believe that he is
entitled to retain such röyalties without an offset against his Agency
salary.
2. We have been advised by Mr. Gene Stevens, WE/Support, that
CRABANAC's cover does not include the role of a writer; CRABANAC's
cover for status will only be a light one of a retired Foreign Service
Officer. Therefore, paragraph 7 of his contract dated 4 July 1965 may.
remain as written. Royalties from the fictional works that he writes as
a profitable hobby will not be emoluments received from or through his
"cover activities."

3. Request your opinion in regard to the retention of
possible royalties earned by Crabanac as a result of his
