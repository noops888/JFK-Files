LIVER FUNCTION TESTS
On 24 October 1968, I saw Dr. Daly of the 310-chemistry
Laboratory of West London Hospital for liver function
tests. My family doctor, Dr. Hodes, sent me to Daly as
a private patient, as British practice is not to take these
tests unless the patient's condition seems to be worsening.
My doctor thought I showed no signs of a recurrence of
hepatitis and the normal practice would have been, at cost,
for me to have been examined by the specialist at the
hospital, who might then decide to ask for the tests.
Daly said that all required tests, except the B.S.P.,
would be done. He said he thought the 3.S.P. unnecessary
unless the others indicated negative factors. In which
case, he said he would ask me to come in again for that.
test.
Daly will send me the results of the tests and his bill
c/o American Express, Rome, within a week.

1. After considering several alternatives and given QRPHONE/1's
lack of financial forward planning, LCPIPIT believes that it would
be beneficial and advantageous for WOFIRM to offer to subsidize a
portion of an overt life insurance program designed to give him both
life insurance and a cash value toward retirement. We have dis-
cussed this with QRPHONE/1 and he has agreed to the desirability of
such a program. He is willing to participate in such an arrangement
and has undertaken to explore the possibilities available to him.
We are forwarding under separate cover a copy of several proposals
which he has received from the local representative of a reputable
WOLADY insurance firm.
2. LCPIPIT requests authority to subsidize up to 1/2 of the
cost of a life insurance program for QRPHONE/1. (This WOFIRM portion
not to exceed $50 per month.) From an administration standpoint
this would merely take the form of an increased monthly payment and
we would take the necessary steps to verify that the funds were
indeed being devoted to their designated purpose.

2- Amy figures concerning dividends are not guarantees nor estimates
since dividends depend upon future experience and the annual action
of the companies trustees
3-
All figures are in the US dollars and based on standard male issue
at age 37.
