On 3-29-61 JESUS MANZARBEITIA, treasurer of the dele
gation in Spain of the Frente Revolucionario Democratico (FRD),
advised that his group had received information that subject
would probably be coming to Spain. MANZARBEITIA said that some
of the more hot-headed Cuban exiles in Madrid wanted to try to
intercept the subject at the airport here in order to administer
a severe physical beating to him. MANZARBEITIA said that he
personally felt that such action would draw unfavorable attention
to the Cuban exiles in Madrid from the Spanish Government, and
that he was doing everything possible to discourage such action.
MANZARBEITIA pointed out that the subject is a close friend of
a wealthy Argentine named JORGE ANTONIO, who resides in Madrid
and who is a close associate of ex-President JUAN PERON of
Argentina, who also lives here. MANZARBEITIA said he is personally
friendly with ANTONIO and thought he could learn from him when
and if subject arrived in Madrid. MANZARBEITIA indicated that
he is not averse to subject getting his "lumps", but felt that
a more careful plan should be worked out.

He indicated that subject had traveled from Mexico to Europe
via Canada on the KLM Airlines. Mr. WILLIAMSON avised that
subject is staying at the Hotel Emperatriz in Madrid.
On 4-4-61 JESUS MANZARBEITIA advised that one of
his sources had reported to him that subject had been seen
at the Bodegon Restaurant in Madrid on 4-3-61 in the company
of JORGE ANTONIO. From this it would appear that subject's
presence in Madrid is definitely known to the Cuban exiles.

On 4-10-61 Mr. WILLIAMSON advised advised that for the moment
subject is being given protection by two members of the Directorate
General of Security (DGS) in Madrid. He said that he had re-
ceived information on that date that the DGS was planning to
use a pretext in an effort to debrief the subject.
On 4-11-61 JESUS MANZARBEITIA and JOSE M. CABEZON,
who heads the delegation in Spain of the FRD, called at the
Madrid Office and supplied the following information.
Approximately a month ago CABEZON, through a Spanish
newspaperman to whom he had given an interview concerning
FAD activities in Spain, became acquainted with AUGUSTIN PARRADAS
SICILIA, and at that time CABEZON was told that although
PARRADAS is ostensibly a newspaperman, he is actually a secret
agent for a Spanish Government organization, not otherwise späm
identified. (As has been previously reported to the Bureau
under the caption AUGUSTIN PARRADAS SICILIA, aka; IS CUBA
& SPAIN, PARRADAS apparently is employed in something of an
informant capacity with the Information Section of the Spanish
High General Staff.) CABEZON said that PARRADAS indicated an
interest in introducing CABEZON to his superiors, but that
this was never done.

MANZARBEITIA advised that he had been approached by
an Inspector PRADAS of the Directorate General of Security in
Madrid, with which individual they maintain contact as repre-
sentatives of the FRD here, to arrange an interview with the
subject for the purpose of obtaining any information which the
subject might be willing to volunteer. MANZARBEITIA pointed
out that Inspector PRADAS is in charge of the investigation
of Cuban matters in Madrid and is most helpful to them;
accordingly he agreed to talk to PARDO LLADA and through JORGE

MANZARBEITIA said that they expected to be furnished a copy
of the questions and answers on 4-12-61, and that they would
furnish a copy of the same to the Madrid Office thereafter.
On 4-11-61 MANZARBEITIA and CABEZON made available
a copy of the first report of PARRADAS, which he had supplied
to them. The contents of this report have been incorporated
into a letterhead memorandum, 12 copies of which are furnished
for the Bureau together with 12 copies of an evaluation
memorandum. The confidential source abroad mentioned in the
letterhead memorandum is MANZARBEITIA, and the memorandum has
been classified confidential since both MANZARBEITIA and
CABEZON are furnishing information of Bureau interest on a
continuing basis to the Madrid Office.
(4)
MANZARBEITIA advised on 4-11-61 that the subject
had told him and DELGADO that he was planning to proceed to
Palma de Mallorca, Balearic Islands, Spain, on the afternoon
of 4-11-61. This is a resort area
()
From the above it appears rather obvious that the
interview of subject on 4-10-61 by MANZARBEITIA and GABINO
DELGADO had been the pretext interview mentioned above by
Mr. WILLIAMSONIon 4-10-61.

Inasmuch as this is primarily a matter coming within
り
CIA jurisdiction and inasmuch as Mr. WILLIAMSON had been keeping (U)
the Madrid Office currently advised of all his activities in
an effort to debrief the subject, on 4-11-61 he was furnished
orally with full information concerning all the interviews of
the subject that were going on and the apparent conflict of
interest between the Directorate General of Security on the
one hand and the High General Staff, represented by PARRADAS,
on the other hand. At the same time he was furnished with a
copy of the report prepared by PARRADAS which contained the
sults of his interview of the subject on 4-7-61. Mr. (WILLIAMSON (U)
subsequently advised on the same date that he had been in
contact with
REGUENGO, of the Social
J Brigade of the Directorate General of Security and the person
through whom he was endeavoring to obtain a debriefing of the
subject. He said that (REGUENGO had apparently learned of the (U)
activities of PARRADAS in interviewing the subject, and in-
dicated that he planned to have PARRADAS arrested. REGUENGO

on 4-11-61 that they planned to give Inspector PRADAS of the
DGS a copy of PARRADAS' report. He said that this report
esentially contained all the information which had been furnished
to him, MANZARBEITIA, by the subject, and he planned to tell
Inspector PRADAS that he could supply no additional information.

tries to justify the system and made various allusions
to the lack of capacity of persons in responsible
positions in Cuba and placed the blame on them for
the present chaotic situation in Cuba. He does not
describe FIDEL CASTRO nor the members of his government
as Communists although he recognizes that all of them
are dominated and under the control of members of the
Communist Party. He claimed that REGINO BOTI, Minister
of Economy, RAUL CEPERO BONILLA, Director of the National
Bank and ex-Minister of Commerce, and LUIS BUCH, Minister
of the Presidency, are all anti-Communists.

He said that all the sugar mills will be
dynamited once an attack against Cuba is started. The
same will happen to the principal industries and centers
of production on the Island.
He does not believe that the execution of

him the truth inasmuch as both PERON and JORGE ANTONIO
were completely ignorant about everything concerning
his journey. This latter would appear doubtful inasmuch
as JORGE ANTONIO went to the airport to meet the subject,
and it is obvious that this latter and his people tried
to cover up the arrival in Madrid of the subject. It was
evident that the subject has a good, old friendship with
General PERON, whom he always defended. (u)
From information obtained from subject, it
would appear that with regard to the aid which the govern-
ment of CASTRO gives to Spanish Communists, perhaps the
most important is that of furnishing Cuban passports to
those who lack documentation. The subject considers that
an invasion of Cuba will be a failure, insisting that
six or seven thousand men can do nothing because there
are so many people who are still with CASTRO. Subject
thinks it would be necessary to wait more time, to let
the matter mature, and that an internal uprising would be
more successful. Besides, if Cuba is attacked now, all
the Communist parties would start an unprecedented campaign
of agitation and propaganda.
(u)
Subject is currently awaiting the arrival in
Madrid of his wife and daughter, who took asylum in the
Venezuelan Embassy in Cuba. Later on he plans to write
a book concerning the atrocities committed by CASTRO and
the Communists in Cuba.
The report of REGUENGO stated that it is the
joint opinion of him and his people that the subject
continues to think Communist. According to him, the Cuban
government is not directly responsible for the situation
but rather the responsibility lies with a planning com-
mission in which there are foreign Communist technicians,
including Russian, Czechoslovakian, Hungarian and Chinese.
This report has not been incorporated in the attached
letterhead memorandum inasmuch as it was supplied by the CIA.

Mr. WILLIAMSON mentioned on 4-11-61 that REGUENGO had (U)
told him that Subject planned to depart Madrid on the afternoon
of that date enroute to Valencia, Spain, from which point he
planned to continue to the Island of Ibiza in the Balearic Islands. (
