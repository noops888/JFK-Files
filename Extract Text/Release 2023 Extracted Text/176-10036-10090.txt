AN AMERICAN OBSERVER (B) FROM DO CAO MINH.
1. DO CAO MINH, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY,
CONJECTURED IN LATE NOVEMBER 1962 THAT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT LONG
TERM ASPECT OF THE STRATEGIC HAMLET PROGRAM MAY WELL BE THE CONCEPT
OF FREE ELECTIONS AT THE HAMLET LEVEL, AND THE EVOLUTION OF THE
ELECTED ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEES AND ADVISORY COUNCILS INTO THE
FIRST ORGANIZED ADMINISTRATIVE ENTITIES BELOW THE VILLAGE LEVEL.
THE PROGRAM IN EACH AREA WILL BE ADVANCED OR RETARDED ACCORDING
TO THE ABILITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL CIVIC ACTION PERSONNEL SENT INTO
THE HAMLETS TO ORGANIZE INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING ELECTIONS.
MUCH ALSO WILL DEPEND ON THE ABILITY OF THE PROVINCE AND DISTRICT
CHIEFS TO ADAPT THEIR THINKING TO THE NEW CONCEPTS. THUS, WITH

DEA RTH OF HIGHLY CAPABLE ADMINISTRATORS FREE FROM TRADITIONAL
AUTOCRATIC PROCEDURES, THE PROBLEM WILL BE ONE OF TRAINING AND
INDOCTRINATION. MINH, WHO HAD THE TASK OF SPONSORING THE
ORIGINAL STRATEGIC HAMLET PROGRAM IN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, AND
HAS BEEN CAREFULLY FOLLOWING ITS SEVERAL NECESSARY MODIFICATIONS,
STATED THAT HE WAS NOT YET SURE WHETHER THE STRATEGIC HAMLET
TRAINING SCHOOL AT THI NGHE WAS GETTING ACROSS TO THE STUDENT
ADMINISTRATORS THE FULL SCOPE AND INTENT OF THE PROGRAM. FOR
THIS REASON, HE PLANNED TO ATTEND THE NEXT COURSE AT THI NGHE
2-15 DECEMBER AND, INSOFAR AS HIS POSITION. ALLOWS, TO
PARTICIPATE AS AN ORDINARY STUDENT.
:
2. AS FOR IMPLEMENTING THE ELECTORAL PROCESS IN STRATEGIC
HAMLETS, MINH CANDIDLY ADMITTED THAT RESULTS HAVE BEEN UNÉVEN.
IN SOME AREAS ELECTIONS HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE DESIRED SPIRIT
OF FREEDOM, WHEREAS IN OTHER AREAS ADMINISTRATORS HAVE BEEN
OVER-ZEALOUS IN EXERTING CONTROL EVEN AFTER COMPLETION OF
THE SECURITY SCREENING PROCESS. WHILE THEIR INSTRUCTIONS
REQUIRE A CLEAR CHOICE BY SECRET BALLOT BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL
CANDIDATES ON AT LEAST TWO SLATES, THEIR ARBITRARY ACTIONS HAVE
IN SOME INSTANCES VITIATED THE SPIRIT OF EDUCATING THE PEOPLE
ON THE PRIVILEGES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF FREE ELECTIONS.
3. ELECTIONS OF ANY TYPE HAVE BEEN HELD IN ONLY ABOUT 600,

AND NOT MORE THAN 700, OF THE APPROXIMATELY 1800 STRATEGIC
HAMLETS THAT MAY ACTUALLY BE CONSIDERED AS COMPLETED, I.E.,
WHERE PERIMETER DEFENSES HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED AND WHERE BASIC
ORGANIZATIONAL TASKS HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED. (FIELD COMMENT:
THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR REPORTED 2872 STRATEGIC HAMLETS COMPLETED
BY 30 AUGUST 1962, WHICH IS OVER 1000 MORE THAN THE FIGURE GIVEN
BY MINH. ON THE WHOLE, PROGRESS, ALBEIT SLOW, HAS BEEN GOOD,
CONSIDERING THE DIFFICULTIES INVOLVED. ONCE A SUFFICIENT
NUMBER OF GOOD EXAMPLES EXIST, THE PROGRAM SHOULD GATHER
MOMENTUM.)
