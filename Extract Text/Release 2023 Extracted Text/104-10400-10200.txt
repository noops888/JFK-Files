1. Reference is made to the request received 30
December 1963 from Mr. Papich concerning Subject and
the information contained in CS-3/474,022; dated 10 May
1961. The source of the cited report is no longer
available for interview; however, numerous references
in the files indicate BUENROSTRO and CORTES are identical.
The following additional information is forwarded for your
possible interest.
2. A report, dated 17 March 1961, received from a
source of unknown reliability, states that Ramon B. CORTE?,
who then was in Cuba, was president of Transcontinental,
S.A., in Mexico and vice-president of the firm in California.
Transcontinental S.A., located at Morelos 98, Despacho 204,
Mexico, D.F., had made four shipments in February 1961 of
spare parts and truck accessories to the Cuban Bank of
Foreign Commerce for the Cuban Ministry of Armed Forces.
Two additional shipments in the amount of $29,505.02 (US)
and $4,000 (US) were made in March. Some of the material
was acquired in the United States and re-shipped without
going through Mexican customs. Cubana Airlines had assisted
in handling the shipments.
3. Carded information, based on an unascribed report,
indicates that an automobile bearing Florida license WW-12379
vas seen in front of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City on 23
March 1961. It was later ascertained that the above license
was registered to Raymond BUENROSTRO Cortez, born 31 August
1918 at Dallas, Texas, and a former Guatemalan Consul in
Florida. In May 1961, he was believed to be in Dallas.

4. Carded information from a report dated 17 May
1961, from a fairly reliable source, indicates Subject
was in contact through cables with Lic. Ignacio HERNANDEZ
(probably Ignacio HERNANDEZ Garcia, secretary and manager
of Transcontinental, S.A.) who was at the Eotel Capri in
Havana, Cuba, HERNANDEZ and Subject, also considered a
frequent visitor to Cuba, reportedly had contact with high
government officials there.
5. A usually reliable source has reported a conversation
on 25 October 1961 between Subject and Ignacio HERNANDEZ
about the possibilities of re-shipping goods to Cuba through
Brazil. HERNANDEZ said that Ruber SUAREZ y Alvarez, representative
in Mexico of the Cuban Bank of Foreign Commerce, would go to
Brazil about 4 November to study the situation there.
If
SUAREZ thought it worthwhile, they might send a shipment large.
enough to merit the transport price through Brazil.

Transcontinental, S.A., you are referred to the Department
of State for numerous despatches dated 1962, from the American
Embassy in Mexico. You are further referred to the following

3. CUEZLA has often boan reported as involved in the assassination
of Col. Antonio FLANCO Rico, former Chief of the Servicio de,
Inteligencia Militer (SIM, Military Intelligence Service) in
1956. On 10 March a possible assassination attempt against 26
of July leaders was reported, and at the same time C. ELA's plan
to leave Cuba was pontioned.
k. The University of Habana is expected to reopen somotime in April.
CUELLA's reported plan to return seems sorewhat inconsistent with
the roport of his cissatisfaction with CASTRO. Diario Nacional's
belief that CUEZLA's departure was due to health rather than
political reasons may be closer to the truth.
