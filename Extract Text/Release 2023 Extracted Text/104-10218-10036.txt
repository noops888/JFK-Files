Action
:
Headquarters approval of Project LIHUFF as outlined
in this dispatch and separate cover attachments.
F.
1. Reference advised the Mexico Station that Chief, WH and KUWOLF
Staff decided not to request approval of the LIHUFF Project as outlined in
HMA-20931 dated 22 March 1963. The reasons for this decision were:
(a) that the Project would support a rightist conservative group
in Mexico without adequate operational control and without
adequate control of the expenditure of KU-ARK funds;
(b) shortage of funds for CA operations;
(c) that the LIHUFF magazine is too conservative and too narrow in
interest to merit KUBARK support;
(d) that Headquarters has not been sufficiently informed about the
student activities to recommend a subsidy of US$8,000 per year.
Reference asked for Mexico Station reaction to Headquarters' position and
for details on how the group could be financed and guided under standards
more acceptable to Headquarters.
2. Headquarters is correct regarding the right-wing conservative.i
attitude of the group; and it is true that the Mexico Station would probably
never have complete operational control of the group. It is also true that
funds once given to the group can no longer be controlled by KUBARK except
through the influence of LIHUFF/1. Nevertheless, the LIHUFF group does some
good and is very useful to the station in the CA field.
3. The Mexico Station agrees that the LIHUFF magazine is conserva-
tive and "pro-capitalist". From the financial point of view, it is requested
that HMS-2530, dated 15 August 1962, and HMMT-3023, dated 30 August 1962, |
and MEXI-2246, dated 18 October 1962 be reviewed for background on the manner
in which the Station became involved in a subsidy for this magazine. In
view of Headquarters' opinion that the magazine is "too conservative_and too,

narrow in interest to merit KUBARK support", Chief of Station, Mexico has
asked IDEN B and his company to pay this subsidy in the future. This
11 arrangement will begin on 1 January 1964. The circulation of this magazine
is approximately 2000 copies. It is definitely conservative, strongly
pro-private enterprise and anti-Socialist. In a meeting on 30 July 1963.
with the Chief of Station and Michael C. Choaden, the Chier, HBFINCH said,
"we do far too little propaganda of IDEN A type; that is, that which is pro-
capitalist and strongly anti-Communist". He said this 15,000 pesos monthly
18 less than it costs monthly for us to put one officer abroad and this is
far wider far beyond what one more man could do". He asked hat the Chief
JwWhat?) of Station appeal to GALBOND to keep financing IDEN A.
4. As previously pointed out to Headquarters, IDEN C provides the
Station with a research facility not otherwise available. They are able to
place articles in newspapers and magazines, sponsor lectures, and sponsor
research projects.
5. Manuel CALVILLO Alonso is an intellectual asset connected with
the LIHUFF organization. He is a source of positive intelligence on right-
wing political groups. He is the brother-in-law of Dr. Salvador NAVA
Martinez of San Luis Potosí, prominent eye surgeon and politician. CALVILLO
also knows the educational field better than any source of the Mexico Station.
He, additionally, provides the Station with background information on well-
known leftists. He has just completed a book on "Penetration of Mexican
Educational System by Communists". This manuscript has been read by Chief,
HRFINCH Mexico, IDEN D, IDEN R, Lic. Fausto MIRANDA and Michael C. Choaden
and the Chief of Station, all of whom believe it an excellent historical
account of penetrations by Communism into the Mexican educational system.
MIRANDA, who has lived through the years cited (1930-1963) believes the
impact of the book (which he says is factual and excellently documented)
"will be terrific".. HAMA-21976 transmitted a copy of this to Buenos Aires
with a request for publication. The timing of this publication is important
because of the impact it is expected to have on impending national elections
in Mexico.
6. The student activities of this group (IDEN E) have been far
more effective than it would appear from Station reporting. LIHUFF/1 and
the Station are at fault for failing to keep Headquarters fully informed on
these activities. Eeadquarters (in reference) recommended that instead of
a flat subsidy for basic expenses for the student group, the Station provide
funds for specific activities, trips, demonstrations, etc. This arrangement
is perfectly acceptable to the Mexico Station. Those activities which are
financed by KUBARK will be coordinated by the Station CA staff. IDEN E
consists of 200 shock troops who are vigorously anti-Communist and campaign
actively against Communist and pro-Castro groups at the UNAM; the University
in Guadalajara, and the University in Puebla. This is an excellent channel
for action, for anti-Communist propaganda and for pro-Free World propaganda.
They are willing to take direction from LIHUFF/2 who will take direction from
LIHUFF/1 (who is in contact with Chief of Station, Mexico). The group
publishes a weekly news organ (IDEN F) forwarded under separate cover. over. Also
by seperate attachment is a list of some of the activities of this group
during the past few months.
7. In summary, the Mexico Station requests that the LIHUFF Project
be approved for an expenditure of US$30,000 to be used for spot covert
action activities via the LIHUFF organization. Of this amount, US$6,000
will be used to pay &. monthly salary of US$500 to LIHUFF/1. The remaining
sum will be used for specific activities in coordination with other CA
activities of the Station.
