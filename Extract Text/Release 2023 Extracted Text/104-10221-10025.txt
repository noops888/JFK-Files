MEMORANDUM FOR: Office of General Counsel

SUBJECT: A127900
REFERENCE: OCC: 76-0344 dated 24 February 1976
Mitchell Livingston Werbell III
1. A review of OCD records indicates that Mitchell L. Werbell III
was an occasional contact and source of this Division from 26 July 1959,
when he first initiated the contact, until March 1971. It appears from
our records that all of the contacts were at Werbell's volition and
that at no time was he viewed as a particularly useful or reliable source.
Werbell did provide unsolicited information which was reported by OCD in
seven foreign intelligence information reports. In January 1976 OCD
responded to a freedom of information inquiry from Werbell. Copies of
the documents released to him are available from the OCD/PIC.
2. After meeting with Werbell at his own request in July 1959 the
Chief of the Miami Field Office noted in a Memorandum for the Record
that little credence could be placed in anything Werbell said. During
succeeding contacts Werbell provided information which resulted in the
following reports:
a. Photographs of Cienfuegos Harbor, Cuba (1965)
b. Drugs and area running, Dominican Republic (1965)
c. Planned coup in Guatemala (1966)
d. Political, economic, military situation in
Dominican Republic (1966)
e. Planned invasion of Haiti (1966)
f. Planned invasion of Haiti (1966)
g. Venezuelan request for arms (1967)

3. In 1966 Werbell reported through our Miami Field Office on an
effort by his own group to assassinate Fidel Castro. Our records do
not indicate what was done about this information.
4. Also in 1965-1966 Werbell pressed for CIA assistance to his
"Organization to Combat Communism." He provided a table of organization.
In January 1966 Werbell hinted that he might meet with some other CIA
representative in Washington, D.C.
5. In 1967 Werbell reported on a possible attempt on the life of
a Middle East diplomat while in the U.S. Werbell had received this
information from a Chet Gray of Los Angeles. This information was
passed to the FBI.
6. In 1971 Werbell's DOD security clearance was revoked, and he
asked DCD for help. He was told that we could do nothing for him. At
this same time Werbell was told that under no circumstances should he
attempt to collect any information on behalf of DCD. He agreed but said
he might be in touch with us again. In fact this was the last contact
with Werbell.
7. Our records indicate that Werbell has a note from former DCI
William Colby, a note resulting from a meeting of former OSS people,
and that Werbell had attempted to use this note to promote his schemes.
8. In 1974 DCD provided information about one of Werbell's schemes
to the FBI for dissemination. This information was not obtained from
Werbell but from a person who knew Werbell. The information concerned
a plot supported by Werbell to gain control of the island of Abaco in
the Bahamas.
9. This same information and some earlier information from the
same source mentions Colonel Robert Bayard (U.S. Army-retired) as an
associate of Werbell's. DCD has not had contact with Bayard.
