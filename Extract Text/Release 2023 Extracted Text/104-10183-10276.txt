b) Galme. DURAN Hernando- Operational Lead only (see separate

unwitting courier for the delivery of microfila to Cuba.
c) 85/1 - Although not a leader of the ArCJ, honas good access
to the APCJ's extremist "circle". He has been used with extremely
good results for information on other Cuban targets of interest.
VII. Evaluations
a) As was stated above, MELLA is completely new to us. However,
the Station is currently conducting an investigation of HELLA
in an effort to determine ais vulnerability for recruitment/defection.
b) with the present roling Dominican Triumvirate, Subject could be
arrested if he came to security notice, not only in nis position
with the CIS but also if he became involved in any subversive
Communist activities. In the event he is arrested he undoubtedly
would be deported.

their normal contacts/1 255/115 being used at this time to

VII. avaluation
while there is no inforaation on hand to indicate Subject is
approachable, the fact that he is in Cuba, known to AX-00/1 - whom
aight approach him and has been identified to us he becomes of
operational interest. Obviously our objective is to continue our
interest and collect what information we sight, awaiting the day for
his exit from Cuba. At that time more definitive action might be
considered. His importance as a source of information on inside
Cuba and that country's intention and capabilities on the Dominican
Republic cannot be discounted and merit our continued alertnoss to
his activities and whereabouts,

Target Analysis Summary Report
SUBJECT: Roque DALTON Garcia
I. Significance of Target
AMMUG/1 Operation
DALTON is a recruited agent of the Cuban DGI. He has been
trained in guerrilla warfare, 8/v, radio transmission,
and radio reception. AMMUG/1 claims that Subject is a
member of the Central Committee of the PCES. ANNUG/1
characterized Subject as having excellent contacts within
the DGI in Cuba. Subject is in contact with Mauricio
de la Selva Venegas, the Salvadoran intermediary, in
Mexico City. In view of the above, Subject could be
expected to furnish considerable information on both the
PCES in El Salvador and his activities for the DGI.
II. Current Location
Subject was deported from El Salvador to Mexico in late
January 1964. On 16 June 1964 Subject was spotted by the
Salvadoran National Police in San Salvador, and is now
under surveillance. Exact address will be obtained by
the San Salvadoran Station.
III. Vulnerabilities
AMMUG/1 lists Subject as his leading candidate for recruit-
nent by us. His reasoning on this is that Subject is not
highly motivated, has a weakness for women and the easy
life, and a generally weak nature. AMMIC/1 says that
Subject is very intelligent, but never showed a real desire
to learn during his Cuban training. Subject was given
600 dollars to purchase a radio receiver upon his return
from Cuba, but he apparently spent the money on himself.
IV. Family and Relatives
Pather (deceased) was U.S. citizen. One of Subject's three
brothers fought for the U.S. in Okinawa. A sister,
Margarita, is Mexican citizen who now is in Cubaas a
student.

Subject is known personally by AKMCC-1 and by (JUGRIN-1.
recently (recruited agent of San Salvador Station, Subject
is presently under surveillance by the National Police
in San Salvador (Station has
who might be used as a lead into Subject).
VII. Evaluation
24
From AMMUG-l's assessment of Subject, based on personal
knowledge and observation, it would appear that Subject
would not be a too difficult target to hit. However,
some of his personal characteristics which have made him
a handling problem for the DCI would presumably make him
a handling problem for us. His failure to perform for
the DGI since October 1963 might mitigate against our
use of him which would include, presumably, resumption of
his s/w channel. Nonetheless, AMMUG-1's claim that Subject
is a maber of the Central Committee of the PCES (nevs to
us) makes his an operational target for that reason alone.

Ι.
Significance of Target
a) Comection wita Cuban Intelligence Service

party, with the ultimate aim of merying the two communist parties
of Haiti. Sensitive information available at the Desk indicates
that this party is Moscow influenced.7
c) Information which Jubject Could Furnish
1. Subject could provide valuable information on the Haitian
Liberation Front, 1.e., its neibers, plans, status with the
U5S2/Cuba etc.
2. Information on the USR/Cuba position with respect to laiti.
3. Information on USSR/Cuba influence and penetrations of

III. Vulnerabilities for recruitment or defection)
None nom. e's strongly anti-UVALLEK. In that many Haitian
exile circles as somesnat down on the United States as a result
of the unsuccessful September 17:3 Invasion of daiti, it is possible
that subject serely turned to the "left" for assistance in overthrowing
UVALIER. It is novever quite feasible that he would cooperate with
time United States if he felt we were taxing an anti-UVALIER stand.

VII. Evaluation
In 1942 or 1947 (reported both ways) CUERANNO was expelled
from the Mexican Communist Party (POI) according to
another mouber of the PCO (LIMOAN) who was a recruiterat
candicate (but dropped), and who said that CUERRERO night
then be amenable to recruitmaat. Apparently no attempt
was made to recruit him. De has been recorded throughout
the years since as an active Communist revolutionary sad
was exiled from Hicaragua for revolutionary activities
ia 1959. Also in 1959 he went to Ciha and was active
there in preparing for the revolutionary movement in all
Latin America. Ho apparently was working for Cuban 13

Nicaragua in 1963, as a document provided by A

written by Madariaga (GUERRERO's psuedo) attempts to
point out reasons for its fallure. Another docent
written by Silvio Kayorga and Orlando quant blanes
"Andres" (GUERRERO) for its failure. GIZEHIRO, Lovever,
sust still be in the good graces of the Cuban IS, if
he is an agent in the "Hijos de la Teapestad" and
serves as "intermediary" to the FLN, or remnants which
nay be roorganizing. It seems highly unlikely that
GUERRERO would be receptive to either recruitment or
defection. AMMG-1 knows him personally and met with
his in Kexico in March 1964. It would appear that
AUNTC-1 could furnish more information about his
contact with GUERRERO which would be helpful ia an
assessment of GUERRKRO.
There is a report that GUERRERO was in Nicaragua
clandestinely in 1962. He would undoubtedly bo
arrested should he return there and his presence
discovered by the Nicaraguans
