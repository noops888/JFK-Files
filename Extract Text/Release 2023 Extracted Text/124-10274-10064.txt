U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO
STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH
RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)
Reference is made to SSC letter dated
January 20, 1976.
Item 1 of referenced letter requested access
to all material furnished to the FBI "by the CIA from
a source known to the FBI as 'COLGS' and who was handled
as a source under the heading 'racial extremist matters." "
It was indicated in Item 1 that CIA had already given
the Committee Staff access to the material in its
possession relating to this source.
In view of the Third Agency considerations
present, this request was discussed on January 23, 1976,
by a representative of this Bureau with Mr. Walter Elder
of the CIA Review Staff. Mr. Elder advised that CIA
had no record of "COLGS" but that it did have information
concerning "CLOGS," the cryptonym for an individual who
was a source of CIA. During the period 1970-1971, CIA
furnished to the FBI approximately 30 memoranda containing
information from "CLOGS." According to Elder, the SSC
has seen everything which CIA has in its files concerning
"CLOGS," including the approximate 30 memoranda which CIA
had furnished to the FBI. Elder expressed the preference
that this Bureau respond to the referenced request by
referring the SSC back to CIA.
FBI files contain a single reference to "CLOGS,"
that being a CIA memorandum dated May 17, 1971, indicating
"CLOGS" to be a CIA source.
