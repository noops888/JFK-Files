copy of this contract will be forwarded to Headquarters when obtained)
The tems of the agreement include, he st teu, that he will provide
through his European contacts at least three pilo: instructors and three
mechanic instructors within thirty days. (Thirty days from when is an
open question) Hore instructors will be needed at a later date, the
possible total number being set at ten, five for flying and five for
mechanical instruction. These instructors will be paid 20,000 Belgian
Congo Francs a conta plus 10,000 BCP bonus. HIROOUR will receive 25,00%

this was promised to him, with other equipment, and though his targeting

the station beica's on short loan in order topirotogrash the Color
port facilities for PIERACT.
7. Recruited instructors should be provided a means of outside
contact with the Station separate from FIROGUE, which could be implementei
if needed, at a later date. The actual hiring and correspondence rela-

wish to commence repayment of the $4,000 loan made to him for his business.
Also, this particular situation could be fairly short-lived in view of
United Nation's offer to the Air Force to assist in Congolese Air Force
training. It is obvious that PIERROT and the Congolese Covemment are
trying to develop several sources at once to guarantee training for their..

of their own accord 1.cer on, either deeming his rot worth keewing be-
cause he is not a profe sionsi airman, or bec..use he will have done
something to antagonize them. Also, the Station or Headquarters may deem
it advisable to esse him out of this job, as Headquarters has suggested
in Ref A, after he has provider in entree for putting some instructors
on the scene We believe this situation represents a worthwhile gain,
however, if HIROGUE does obtain the contract as presently constituted.
9. Attachment C provides some information concerning Paul Arnold
PIERROT and the Congolese Air Force which was provided by the Air Attache,
Leopoldville, and which has already been reported through their channels.
PIERROT is obviously trying to develop a training program and build up
the Congolese Air Force from several sources at once, and if several
of these sources provide the desired aid it is debatable if his own
program (with WIROGUE) would become very extensive or eve:: be imple-
mented. It is also possible that WIROGUE's role in the training picture
could shift at any time. We feel that at this time we can only go
along with developments as they occur and try to realize the maximum
benefit from the situation Headquarters will be kept informed of any
changes in the situation, and be provided more specific data when avail-
able.
10. In all fairness to WIROGUE, it should be pointed out that
until recently the station has not had the time to properly target WIRO-
GUE As he appears to be untrained in KUTUBS and KUCAGE operations, he
requires a great deal of case officer time, an item which is in short
supply in this station. We believe WIPOGUE may develop into a worth-
while asset, if the time and attention he requires can be spent on him,
however. The station is taking the appropriate steps in this direction.

SUBJECT: Paul Arnold PIERROT - Background Information provided by
Air Attache, Leopoldville
:
1 N' DOLO airport is currently being evacuated by the UNO.C
forces and turned over to the Congolese government for use by the
Congolese Air Force There are some 150 cadet's who have received some
training and are considered ready for advanced training, but as of this
time, have nowhere to be trained PIERROT has made extensive efforts
to obtain aid from many sources to train these cadets The AIRA re-
ports that FIERECT has requested aid from the Belgians, the British,
United Nations, and asked the AIRA to request aid from the French for
the Congolese-Air Force About 30 cadets are in training in Tunisia at
the present time. Cn 11 March the AIRA recommended aid be extended to
the Congolese Air Force, but under the auspices of the United Nations,
2
PIERROT also reported 11 March that he had 6 Koth and 9 Har-
vard T-6 aircraft being delivered near the end of March, and asked if
the United Nations Command would allow them to enter the Conge: He
even offered to let the planes remain under U.N. control.
3. PIERROT is a mulatto and claims to have a white grandmother
in Dallas, Texas He was trained by the Belgians and claims to have
flown C-47's and T-33 jet planes, though he has not been on flying sta-
tus since 1956 due to goiter trouble At this time accurate bio data
is not availalbe His assistant is Lt K.J. LEKAN who is reportedly
completely devcted to PIERRCT. PIERROT is personally ambitious and at
one point in the fall of 1960, he approached TFELIDE authorities with
a plan to take over the government if they would help him His plan
was too transparent and weak for any sericus consideration at that
time
