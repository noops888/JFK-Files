SUMMARY OF RESETTLEMENT ACTIVITY
1 - 30 September 1963
I. DEFECTOR CASES:
A. On Hand at Beginning of Reporting Period:
DS-109
Subject moved out of HARVARD housing
during the month after having located
appropriate employment with CAMANTILLA'S
assistance. The results of Subject's
T.B. tests were obtained on 24 September
and are negative. He will continue in
his current job and concentrate on
further English study until December
when he will again be considered for
immigration to the U.S. under P.L.
86-648.
DS-129
Through the assistance of MKTOPAZ and
ODIBEX, Subject received his Fremdenpass
and was interviewed for FEDREP political
recognition. Shortly after being turned
over to CAMANTILLA, who is assisting him
in his efforts to obtain local employ-
ment, the need for additional interroga-
tion arose. While his job hunt was,
therefore, slightly delayed, it should
recommence shortly. Due to the sensitive
nature of Subject's documentation
problem (having been previously granted
refugee recognition by another country),
HARVARD Will continue to maintain contact
with him until the Reiseausweis is issued.
IDEN-271*
Subject immigrated to the U.S. 19 September
1963 without HARVARD assistance or
CAMANTILLA sponsorhip.

HARVARD Resettlement Aims: Subject's
processing for immigration to the U.S.
under Public Law 414 has already been
completed. He is scheduled to depart
28 October 1963 via an ICEM flight for
New York where CAMANTILLA will meet and
assist. Until this departure date he
will occupy HARVARD housing and continue
his study of English.
Profession: Mechanical Engineer
Rec'd by HARVARD: 30 'September 1963
From: CABEZONE

Age: 30
No. of Dependents: 0.
Resettlement Officer: Arthur A. LIFALL
HARVARD Resettlement Aims: Immigration
to Canada (see EGOA 20576, dated 24

C. Former Defector Resettlement Cases (or Cases Still in Stage II)
Requiring HARVARD Action During the Reporting Period:
DS-924
Camp King informed HARVARD that Subject
had applied for a Reiseausweis renewal
in order to visit the FEDREP. Head-
quarters' answer to HARVARD's query re
adviseability of issuing renewal will be
passed to the appropriate authorities,
thru Camp King, when received.
DS-125
While immigration to the U.S. under P.L.
86-648 was initiated for Subject and his
family (see EGOA-20570, 18 September 63),
HARVARD now feels his best chances for
U.S. entry, in view of his long C.P.
membership, is under P. L. 414 first
preference (see FRAN 2170). Preliminary
discussions have been held with AMCONGEN
and an advisory opinion will be obtained.
DS-127
Application for U.S. immigration under
P. L. 86-648 has been formally
turned down by the local I&NS office.
CABEZONE is currently awaiting. Head-
quarters reaction to EGOA-20573, 19
September which recommends P. L. 110
handling.
Resettled during the reporting period. Subject will not
appear on next month's or subsequent HARVARD reports unless
and until some new unforeseen aspect of the case arises
requiring additional HARVARD action. In this event the
case will be listed and the new action described under
Category IIC.

II. AGENT CASES:
A. On Hand at Beginning of Reporting Period:
CAHAVOC-1
Subject continues to be of interest
to FOB and will occupy HARVARD housing
until he is successful in his attempts
to find an apartment on the economy.
WIROGUE
Background material for Subject's new
legend has been acquired with the
assistance of Stage I. HARVARD hopes
to begin the final stages of Subject's
resettlement in the near future.
IDEN-264*
Subject immigrated to the U.S. 5 September
1963 on PAA FLT #73.
IDEN-272
The initial stages of FEDREP political
recognition have been completed. Subject's
position has been legalized to the extent
that he is now looking for employment on
the economy.
IDEN-274
With the assistance of CAMANTILLA Subject
commenced his photographic training in
Hamburg on 10 September. Upon completion
of his schooling (in early 1964) he will
be given the monetary grant awarded by
Headquarters as compensation for his
eight-year imprisonment.
B. Received During Reporting Period:
NONE
C. Former Agent Resettlement Cases Requiring HARVARD Action
During Reporting Period:
AEBLANKET-2
HARVARD C. O. ORME K. DAPONNAT and
former HARVARD C. O. DAVID R. REINBOLD
visited Subject at her request. She
asked for help for a girlfriend who had
become involved in possible foreign..
intelligence activities in the local
area. Arrangements were made for
REINBOLD to introduce an FOB/CE С.О.
to Subject.
AEPOLE-25
Additional correspondence has been
exchanged with Subject in connection
with his attempting to establish with
FEDREP authorities that he contributes
to the support of his children living
in the USSR.

DIHESITANT
At the request of FOB/SAT, HARVARD
has been in contact with AMCONGEN FRAN
to establish most expeditious way for
Subject to be processed for immigration
to the U.S. Immigration is complicated
by the fact that Subject and wife are
residing in another country and for
security reasons must not be processed
at the U.S. Consulate located in that
country.
TULANCE-1
HARVARD continues to maintain contact
with Subject through our local post
box and is cabling Headquarters and other
appropriate KUBARK elements the gist of
Peach letter received.
IDEN-238,241,
242
IDEN-239 & 240
IDEN 263
HARVARD maintains periodic contact with
this family and continues to pay the
widow of IDEN 238 a monthly subsistence
payment of DM 150.
HAPVARD arranged for a meeting between
the local representative of CAMANTILLA
and an FOB/SAT C. O. to discuss the
possibility for continued financial
assistance to Subjects through U.S.E.P.
The New York office of CAMANTILLA has
brought to HARVARD's attention the
recurring difficulties which it has had
with Subject. This problem was discussed
with FOB/SAT and a summary of the
situation forwarded to Headquarters in
FROB 5827.
Resettled during the reporting period. Subject will not appear
on next month's or subsequent HARVARD reports unless and until
some new unforeseen aspect of the case arises requiring
additional HARVARD action. In this event the case will be listed
and the new action described under Category IIC.

WIROGUE
Subject's new legend has been prepared
and will be used to provide the details
for a new FEDREP political recognition
interview. The next step will be to
arrange to have the new interview story
substituted for the old thus paving the
way for Subject's permanent resettlement.

1. References represent an initial misunderstanding of
the problem of WIROGUE which is now being clarified.
2. The problem of backstopping of resettlement and
disposal cases has been carefully reviewed by elements of CSB
concerned including CAΒΕΤΟΝΕ, ΜΚΤOPAZ and CATHINK. In this
connection there is attached a copy of a memorandın dated 27
August 1963 from Chief/MKTOPA? which outlines the current
situation. As will be noted IKTOPAZ has and will expand its
capability for procurement of operational documents independent
of the 513th ICG. It is believed that the present procedures
for backstopping of resettlement and disposal cases should be
continued. In theory an independent capability is desirable
but not really practical at this time. Creation of an
independent capability for backstopping resettlement cases
would require duplication of the procedures and practices now.
followed by lir. Fillms of the 513th ICG. In addition, we would
not have the advantage of hiding our cases from the Germans among.
other Army disposal cases. Furthermore, USAREUR has requested
notification prior to contact with any German officials of any
sensitive cases which we may desire to handle without military
assistance--see USAREUR letters dated 7 August 1961 and 25 March
1962, attached. with considerable effort it would be possible
to backstop some of our resettlement and disposal cases directly
with German officials. It would be quiet difficult, however, to
prevent the Army from learning of such action which is contrary
to the USAREUR request.
3. It is possible that the FEDREP will enact new
legislation on the control of non-German refugees. Likewise,
new FEDREP emergency laws may affect this type of case. We will
keep this situation under review and in the event the circum-
stances change will. initiate appropriate action.

DS-108
Subject continues to study English

job in Ruesselsheim early next month
and return to Frankfurt.
DS-109
Subject's processing for immigration
to the U.S. under the Parolee Act
has been deferred until December 1963,
Due to a change in the right lung,

earlier x-rays, the U.S.P.H.S. has
requested the deferment until sputum
tests and future x-rays indicate the
condition stabilized or eliminated.
DS-129
Arrangements are being made through
ODIBEX for Subject to receive FEDREP
political recognition. CAMANTILLA
will then assist in finding a job
and housing on the local economy.
In the meantime Subject is taking
German language lessons.
IDEN-271
Subject's life story has been
prepared with appropriate changes
regarding his defection in Ireland.
