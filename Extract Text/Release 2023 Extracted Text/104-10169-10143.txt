about 1730 hours, they accidentally met Petr DERYABIN who was
walking in the opposite direction. DERYABIN recognized ARIADLE/1
instantly, and the two shook hands and greeted each other enthusi
astically. DERYABIN inquired about AKLADLE/l's family, and AELADLE/1
said that they were well and were with him. AELADLE/1 asked
DERYABIN if he had married, to which DERYABIN replied that he had,
and that as of the day before yesterday he was the proud father of
& son. DERYABIN presented a cigar to each of the others. DERYABIN
asked Mr. Harris, "When will all this be in the newspaperst" Mr.
Harris replied that he didn't know. Mr. Harris congratulated
DERYABIN on the birth of his son and told him and AELADLE/1 that
the street corner was not an appropriate place to talk. The others
agreed, and they parted.

whereabouts.
