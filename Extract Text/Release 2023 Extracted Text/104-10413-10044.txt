PURPOSE: Project provides for a joint CIA/Mexican Government
telephone tap center and for a nonofficial liaison rel
tionship which provides access to the highest levels o
the Mexican Government. All Soviet and Czechoslovak
installations and major anti-U.S. elements are covered
by the operation.
PROG-
RESS
: Project has provided Station with a channel to the
President of Mexico which is effective, rapid and cove
and was particularly worthwhile in making arrangements
for President Kennedy's visit to Mexico in June 1962.
The Mexican President was also briefed on the Cuban
situation through this channel. The joint tap center
provides coverage of 30 lines yielding positive and CI
information of value. Division reports 236 positive
disseminations on a variety of topics with concentrati
on Communist and anti-U.S. activity. A large amount c
information not disseminated is used by other U.S.
agencies in Mexico. The Station feels that this opera
tion contributes greatly to the present friendly attit
of Mexican Government leaders toward U.S. policies.

COMMENTS: FI and CI Staffs concur in renewal.
FI STAFF: FI/INT points out that the project is
the most productive, in terms of volume, reporting
on Mexico. It is also the most productive tele-
phone tap operation, in terms of volume, of all
our tap efforts. Cuban reporting and that con-
nected with President Kennedy's trip to Mexico
were of especial value.
CI STAFF: Concurs with Station's plan to move the
intercept center for the reasons stated. The proj-
ect activity is bound to become of interest to
various opposition elements and the Station is well
advised to make necessary changes to provide for
and improve on the security of the operation.
