INFO
Mrs. Thea Hall of TSD just told me
in the course of a visit that Herman
E. KIMSEY of BEVISION fame,
a former TSD nick called her on
the phone and tried to get her to
have lunch with him, so he could
get her to analyse the handwriting
of some homosexuals who were
the "real murderers of Martin Luther
King". KIMSEY gives out that he
is working to exonerate RAY for
this peccadillo.
Mrs. (Hall) said she avoided contact
and will report this to Mr. (Saunders)
TSD Security Officer.) (previously
she told (Bob Goodenow, but he told
her to forget it and evade KIMSEY.
I suggested she better tell (Saunders)
as KIMSEY is capable of any action
involving her or the Agency.)
KIMSEY also told Mrs. (Hall) thathis
side-kick R Cleve BAKSTER has found
a way to use a lie detector on plants
even to detect people who murder
other plants in the presence of a
plant that serves as a witness....
Nothing succeeds like excess....
