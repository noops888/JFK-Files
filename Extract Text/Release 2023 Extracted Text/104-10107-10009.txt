USA v. Gerald P. Hemming, Et Al.
(76-371-CR-CA)
1. As reported in Paragraph 4 of Reference A, the trial
of Gerald P. Hemming (Reference B) was severed on 10 January
1977. I was informed of the severance during my pre-trial
conference with AUSA Karen Atkinson in Miami, Florida on that
same day. AUSA Atkinson told me I could return to Washington,
D.C. and she would have the Drug Enforcement Administration
Miami Regional Office inform me if and when the trial was
rescheduled. I orally reported the above to Mr. Billy Hix,
SE Division Security Officer, Ms (Hope Mason, Acting Chief
SE/X/LA, and Mr. Robert Blandford, CCS, OCS, upon my return
to Headquarters on 11 January 1977. I also forwarded Reference
A copies to Office of Security, External Activities Branch
and the Office of General Counsel, Mr. Edmund Cohen.
2.
SA
On 28 February 1977 I was contacted by SA Robert
Fredericks of the DEA Miami Regional Office and informed that
the Hemming trial was scheduled to begin 2 March 1977.
Fredericks asked me to be on standby to travel to Miami to
appear as a witness on behalf of the United States Government.
SA Fredericks said it was not certain the trial would begin
EF
on 2 March and he did not know whether I would be needed
as a witness.
3. I requested that SA Fredericks initiate action to
authorize me to travel to Miami via GTR issued by DEA.
SA Fredericks said he would initiate that action.
awaiting further notice from SA Fredericks.
