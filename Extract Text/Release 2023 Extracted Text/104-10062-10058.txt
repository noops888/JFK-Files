CUBAN INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES
IN THE UNITED STATES
Just before the time of the Camarioca affair in
October of 1965, I made a clandestine trip by
boat to Cuba to bring out relatives of Cuban
who resided in the United States. This trip was
made in to boats with ENRIQUE GONZALEZ, Crow deceased;
first unknown CARILLO; HUMBERTO OBREGON;
ARTURO MAYAN ANDRES ANDRES and other cabans,
do not know, but who used the nicknames
"EL GUMAGUA" and "EL PICARO."
When I was visiting a person in Havana, Cuba,
whose name I do not remember, who was a person
I had been sent to in order to make arrangements
for the families who were leaving Cuba with me,
I was detained by two men whoïdentified themselves
to me with credentials as G-2 Agents. They took me
to an office in Havana, of which I do not know the
address. In this office, they kept me for eight
to ten hours. While I was detained, a man dressed
in olive drab uniform interrogated me. This man
accused me of being an Agent for the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the United States,
which I denied. At the request of this uniformed
man, I consented to work for the G-2 in the United
States in exchange for my freedom and also permission
to return to the United States with the Cuban
families
701-265065
The G-2 official gave me the address of
RAMIRO VALDES Minister of the Interior or Minister
of Internal Security of Havana, Cuba, and told me
to either write him or to call JAIME RODRIGUEZ
at Havana telephone number 35-861. de gave M
no further instructions, but told me that I should
keep in contact, since they would possibly need

concerning my background, including my address,
which was at that time 107 Southwest 18th Court,
Apartment #8, Miami, Florida.

My next come any import with the
CIS occurred some five months later, when I wrote
a letter directed to RAMIRO VALDES and enclosed
it in letter which I had written to my wife,.
HILMARTINEZ, This letter was addressed to
DROM ARTINEZ at 1126 Avenida Narciso Lopez,
Altamina, Pinar del Rio, Cuba, or to the Bar La
Plata, San Cristobal, Pinar del Rio, Cuba. I
wrote this letter to RAMIRO VALDES with the
purpose of paving the way for another trip to
bring people out of Cuba. In other words, it
was to insure my entrance and departure, without
dificulty from the Cuban Government. In this
letter, I wrote only that I was still at their
service, and that I would soon return to Ciba by
boat. I did not receive an answer to this
letter.
My next contact with the CIS was in August
of 1966, when I went to Cuba by boat to bring
people out of Cuba and to bring them to the
United States as refugees. On this trip, I went
no with ADOLFO BORGES FELIPE HORRES HUMBERTO no 201

HOBREGON atна копе ВАЗ 10, whose wirst name I do not
know. On this trip, we arrived. in Cuba at midnight,
and BORGES and I went to the home of his parents
in Rancho Veloz, Las Villas. The next morning,
I left with the sister of BORGES, BLANCA, for
Sagua la Grande, where I obtained a car which took
me to Havana. BORGES had instructed me to
contact a family in Havana which was friendly
with BORGES, but the man to whom I had been

had already gone to Sagua la Grande.
Then I went to the house of JULIO MORENO in
Haveaa. I do not know the address, but there
I contacted several relatives of MORENO who
wanted to leave Cuba. In order to assure me that
I would have no problem leaving Cuba, I
called the telephone number of JAIME RODRIGUEZ,
the number they had given me previously, and asked
them to contact me on an urgent matter. A little
later, three men dressed in civilian clothing
arrived in a car, and one of them identified
himself as JAIME RODRIGUEZ. He was a white man,
5'8", 155 pounds, sharp features, with a short
beard and large ears. He gave me no specific
instructions, but told me to stay in contact
with them.
After this, I had no contact with the CIS
until about February or March of 1967. This
was after I had been detained by United States
Customs Agents in Miami when I was trying to
leave for Cuba by boat. On this occasion,
February 21, 1967, I was arrested and charged
with Assaulting_a_Federal Officer, and I was
freed on bond, awaiting trial. After I was out
on bond and while I was awaiting trial, I was
restricted to the State of Florida. In the meantime,
I wrote the second letter to RAMIRO VALDES and
sent it enclosed in a letter addressed to my
wife in Cuba to one of the above-mentioned
addresses. In this letter, I told VALDES that
I was in a difficult situation and could not
leave the State of Forida, and that I wished to
talk to someone who could help me.

I received an answer to this second letter
in about July of 1967, while I was in jail.
The answer was a typewritten letter signed "RENE,"
and was sent in an envelope placed inside another
envelope. The outside envelope was sent from
Costa Rica. I did not receive this letter while.
in prison, since ADOLFO BORGES, with whom I was
living opened it and kept it for me until my
departure from prison in September of 1967
After I left prison in September of 1967,
I received several telephone calls at the home of
ADOLFO BORGES from an individual in New York
who identified himself as "MONTES DE OCA" and 2
"JULIAN" When I first talked with him, he told
me that he was "RAMIRO's cousin." He later
told AKA
identified himself as JESUS TIMENEZ ESCOBAR 201-749244
First Secretary of the tuber Mission to the
United Nations (CMUN). I made several trips to
New York under assumed names. In New York, I
met with JESUS JIMENEZ and we discussed the Cuban
exile situation. Complete information about these
trips and meetings with JIMENEZ have been furnished
in signed statements, to Agents of the BI NEW Yerk
Since the first contact with (JIMENEZ, I have
made several reports by telephone and others personally
to JIMENEZ about the activities of several anti-CASTRO
groups in Miami, and I have received about two thousand
dollars from JIMENEZ for these services, including
money for the tickets to New York.
Concerning these reports, JIMENEZ showed a
great deal of interest in information relating to
clandestine trips to Cuba by members of the anti-
CASTRO groups in Miami, as well as any plan of
attack against the person of FIDEL CASTRO. All

RE:

IN THE UNITED STATES
the information that I have given to CIS has been
deceiving or false, and I have been careful to
insure that the false information could not be
checked on. To demonstrate that I was a reliable
person, I gave certain information about events
that had already happened which could be verified
or which was public information. For example,
after one clandestine trip to Cuba carried out
by Cuban exiles, I gave information about this
trip, but only after they had returned to the
United States. I never have given information
which could have jeopardized any person, to the
best of my knowledge.
In December of 1968, I furnished to JIMENEZ
a completely fale story about a plan by Cuban
exiles in Miami to assassinate FIDEL CASTRO. I
told him that they were going to make this attack
while CASTRO was speaking at the annual celebration
on the first or second of January, 1969. I told
JIMENEZ that the names of the Cuban exiles involved
in this plan were the following: ALFREDO JIMÉNEZ,
JUAN VALDEZ (first name unknown) Holwaa сивит
Known as NICO." I told JIMENEZ that they would
use grenades, poison gas and silencers. I reported
that I had received this information from a Cuban
whose last name is SAAVEDRA, who is a boat
mechanic working for an agency of the United
States Government in Miami.
After giving him this report, JIMENEZ called
me several times each week during December of 1968,
to find out if I had learned more about this
attempt against the life of FIDEL CASTRO. In
January of 1969, I reported to JIMENEZ that the

group had returned, and had failed in their
mission. To the best of my knowledge, none of
these persons exist, with the exception of
SAAVEDRA.
In making these reports, I used certain
code words which had been given to me by
JIMENEZ, and they are as follows:
NOEL
-
FIDEL CASTRO
EUSEBIO
-
RAUL CASTRO
ORLANDO
-
OSVALDO DORTICOS
ARTURO
JUAN ALMEIDA
NORBERTO
-
RAMIRO VALDES
These code words have been used by me in
telegrams sent to addresses in Cuba designated
by JIMENEZ, which I have previously furnished to
the FBI. The telegrams which I sent were
signed with the code name "ALFREDO" and other
names. These telegrams were only sent to Cuba.
Near the end of 1967, JIMENEZ told me to
make a trip to Cuba with a select group, which
included ADOLFO BORGES, and he told me that I
would receive documents in Cuba which would
indicate that a Cuban_wanted to defect from
the Cuban Government. Then, upon returning
from Cuba, I should hand over these documents
to the United States Government. JIMENEZ told
me that this Cuban would pretend to be a defector,

and would make contact with the United States
(Government, but actually he would be an Agent for
(CIS) Since I never returned to Cuba, this plan
was never carried out. Although he never gave
me the name of the Cuban, I was under the
impression that it would be someone unknown in
the intelligence field.
At this time, I also remember that JESUS
JIMENEZ gave me instructions to talk to PEDRO
(리 사진동, a Miami jeweler who is a friend of
OZO. He told me that in conversation
with LOPEZ, I should try to learn if LOPEZ had
received any information from "BEBE" REBOZO
relating to the policies of President RICHARD
NIXON concerning the Cuban situation.
JIMENEZ also instructed me to talk with
MANUEL ARTIME about the Cuban problem.
My last contact with JIMENEZ was at 1:00 AM,
February 20, 1969, at which time he called me
by telephone while I was in the house of ADOLFO
BORGES in Miami. JIMENEZ had told me he was going
to call me on February 14, 1969, at Miami
number 642-9176. I waited for the call, and
since he did not call me, I sent a telegram to
Havana, Cuba, addressed to OLGA RODRIGUEZ, Calle 31 #108,
between First and Second Avenues, Varadero, Matanzas,
Cuba. In the telegram, I wrote, "Await my call
on the 19th. Regards, ALFREDO," I sent this
telegram on Sunday, February 16, 1969. This telegram
is the code that I have with JIMENEZ, and the code
means that JIMENEZ should call me at 8:00 PM on the
night indicated in the telegram. During the call
from JIMENEZ on February 20, 1969, he asked me how

things were going, and also told me he would be
gone for two months, and that another person
would contact me on the third or fourth of
March, 1969, at 8:00 PM, at Miami telephone number
642-9176. This person is to identify himself
with the_code, "Playa Menendez," or "Playa Salinas"
I have read this declaration of eleven pages
and it is correct.
(Signed by the source and witnessed by two
Special. Agents of the FBI.)
On February 25, 1969, the source made available
three cards containing printed words in the Spanish
language. Source advised this printed material
constitutes the code which was utilized by him for
his messages to CIS. He said the cards were furnished to
him by JESUS JIMENEZ ESCOBAR sometime during November of
1968 At the time they were given to him, they
were enclosed in a small plastic envelope which
had been placed in a secret compartment of the carrying
case for a Schick electric shaver. Source said JIMENEZ
gave him the electric shaver along with the carrying
case, and demonstrated to him how to open the secret
compartment.
:
The code cards contained the following information,
as translated from the Spanish language:
