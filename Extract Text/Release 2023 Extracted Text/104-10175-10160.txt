2023 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
List of Action, Matter "Y"
Committee of Filtre
(7/1)-1964 Covert Income Tax Matters
U50-6036
1. Based on the copy of subject's short 1964 Federal income tax
return forwarded via interoffice, headquarters prepared subject's
1964 covert income tax return. It is identical to the overt return
with the following exceptions:
A. Income on line 6 has been lowered by $5,000, subject's
covert compensation paid to subject in 1964. This loss
is reported on schedule C.
B. Since it was more advantageous to subject to allocate his
foreign income taxes as an itemized deduction instead
of claiming a foreign tax credit, the total itemized
deductions have been increased from $178.29 to $2,017.00.
2. It is requested that HQ review, sign and return the attached
returns to Headquarters, ETO, Reston, Va. together with remittance
of the tax due, $299.00 plus statutory interest computed at the rate
of 6 percent per annum from April 15 to date of payment.  Per diem checks
in payment of covert tax liabilities must be made payable to a fictitious
payee.
3. In reviewing subject's overt tax return it has been noted that
he claims a foreign tax carryover on his Form 1116 accruing to the
difference between the total foreign tax paid and that allocated as foreign
tax credit.  The carryover is limited to the difference
between the limitations (Column 12) and the allowable credit (column
13). Therefore, subject has no foreign tax carryover for any of the years.
