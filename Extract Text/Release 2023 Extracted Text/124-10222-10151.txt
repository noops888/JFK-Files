A British official service from a regular source, probably
Freliable, with good contacts in the MRR.
1. On 15 June 1964 a member of the Venezuelan Branch of the Movi-
miento de Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MRR, Movement for Revo-
lutionary Recovery) claimed that the MRR has no operational
base in Venezuela and does not intend to establish one. The
MRR maintains an office in the Dominican Republic and is
believed to have facilities for using that territory as an
occasional staging point for attacks against Cuba. The MRR,
however, does not have a permanent base or training camp in
the Dominican Republic. The Dominican Government has little
interest in supporting Cuban exile activities at the present.
time.
2. No large-scale exile operations against Cuba by the MRR will
take place until after the November 1964 elections in the
United States. The MRR claims that this decision is based on
the fact that at least six months of preparation will be re- C
quired before internal conditions in Cuba will be favorable
and that the decision does not imply close connivance between
the MRR and the United States Administration.
