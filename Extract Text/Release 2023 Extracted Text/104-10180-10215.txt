first, contacted by AMPANIC-1, who passed the lead over to
the

of the cldof'ercedes Benz Arency at Palecon and Principe Streets,
and ANIRE-1 then then con contacted subject in the latter's apartment in
of building located in the middle of the

Between

safehouse located at
which had been obtained
for that purpose by ΑΡΓΟΧ-1. ΑLFOX-1 attended the training
sessions as a lock-out, but neither MFCX-1 nor AMCLEN-1 knew
the identity and address of the traince. Training included the
clandestine operation of a RS-1, the use of signal plans, the use
of pads in coding and decoding, and personal security. Training

training and the identity of the candidate. Tulfoct was never
activated and was kept on stand-ly for possible use at a later
date. For that purpose tona fides were established ty A-1
and reported to his Co. Subject was not supplied with a Tset
and no signal plans nor pads were issued to him.
4. Al recalls Subject was very secure in his clandestine
contacts and operations. Despite established bona fides, ANIRE 1
had considerable trouble in gaining Subiect's confidence and ol
three preliminary contacts were necessary before retting down to
business, Subject was last contacted by A13E-1 at Subject's
apartment described above, in January or renfuary 1961. At
this time Subject was still willing and ready to work.
ols. It is assumed that Headquarters files on the activities of
AMIRD-1, AMCLEN-1 or AMFOX-1 will contain copies of the training
reports and information reported by AMIRELI. We would appreciate
Headquarters assistance in ascertaining Subject's identity and
present whereabouts in order to determine if he could still be
used operationally inside target area. AMPANIC-1 has been
terminated by JMWAVE PA Branch because of weakness in his personal
security, and it is believed best not to contact him on this
matter if possible.
