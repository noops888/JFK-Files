The November 7, 1963, issue of the "Miami News"
carried an article entitled, "Fake Revolt Planned for Cuba,
Says Prio." This article alleged that a phony Cuban uprising,
controlled by Russia, was being prepared in Cuba to pave the
way for United States recognition of a neutralist regime in Cuba.
PRIO alleged this plan was worked out recently in Havana between
Cuba and Soviet officials, and an unidentified American.
