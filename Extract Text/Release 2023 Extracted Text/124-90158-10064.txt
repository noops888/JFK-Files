Information on the U.S. persons whose names appear on

foreign nationals, contractors, or contractor/consultants.
The extraction and dissemination of the information is
controlled by the originator. It is requested that no
action be taken regarding it without prior approval of
this office.

1976, with subject title "Report Received by Panamanian
