Pueblo (MRP Rescate Revolucionario, 2, andirectorio and Revolucionario ionario
Estudiantil (DRE). Other groups with limited organizations are the Unidad
Revolucionaria and the ARA.Asociacion de Amigos de Aureliano Sanchez
Arango). The strength of the the groups by province is as follows:
a.
Southern Oriente Province (Santiago de Cuba)-
(1) MRR. The MRR, of Nino Diaz, has members from the ranks of the
26 of July Movement and, especially, from the former regular Army.
Its civilian organization is poor, almost non-existent. The men
remain inactive, waiting for a serious military action of a local
or national character.
рез
A
(2) MDC.. The MDC has an adequate civilian organization; from the
founding of the movement Santiago de Cuba has been one of its
strongholds. The military organization is extremely poor. Many
of its leaders have gone into exile or are trying to do so.
They remain totally inactive in hope of an invasion which will resolve
the situation, and only concern themselves about a future political
life, at the time when the procent government falls.
(3) 30 de Noviembre. There are few members of the 30 de Noviembre in
Santiago de Cuba, and they lack contact with their national leaders.
They have practically no resources.

atil October 1961 the MRP had a good civilian and military organization.
Immediately after the arrest of Reinos Gonzales the national co-ordinator, the
local.co-ordinator and almost all the members in the province sought asylum.
The New co-ordinator is trying to reorganize the movement. There are still
enough men of action, coming from the 26 of July Movement, but they have to
re-establish contacts.
(5) Rescate: Rescate has no members in this area.

(6) DRE. The DRE was completely broken by the unsuccessul uprising of Albert Muller
and by the arrest in October of "El Fiera", provincial co-ordinator. The DRE
still has great prestige in the area, and there are many who would follow its

(4) MRP. Even before the debacle of October the, MRP had a very poor
organization in this area. Fito Gomez ("Ricardo"), the co-ordinator,
was arrested in the roundup at that time, but escaped and took asylum
in the Ecuadorean Embassy. His successor and the military and civilian
personnel are relatively capable. DOM INTELL DIY,
(5) Rescate. It does not exist in this area.
(6) DRE. It does not exist in this area.
c. Camaguey Province.
(1) MRR. At the beginning of April, 1961 Caballero (inu), the co-ordinator,
whose nickname is "El Viejo", was arrested and condemned to 30 years
on the Isle of Pines. Arango (fnu), who was named co-ordinator in
August, has been forced to seek asylum in Habana. The movement has
been destroyed.
(2) MDC. The MDC has an excellent co-ordinator, Blanco (fnu), who is
responsible, discreet, with good connections. The MDC has a very good
civilian organization and at present is concerned about its military
organization, for which they already have some personnel. They work
effectively and are trying to carry out some military actions.
(3) 30 de Noviembre. The civilian organization is relatively good. It has
a small but effective military force..
(4) MRP. Camaguey is practically the only province in which the MRP was not
affected by the arrests of October. It has a good civilian organization
and military forces of importance, which are under the command of former
officers of the Rebel Army. Arquimides Caballero (Esteban"), its
former co-ordinator, took asylum in the Brazilian Embassy; "Ricardo",
his replacement, is very young (21 years old) but is considered very good.
(5) Rescate. It has a poor organization. There are enough men, but they
are inactive.
(6) DRE. Few members of the DRE remain, and "Tronco" and Rafael Angel Quevedo,
its directors, are known by G-2. The movement has been destroyed.
