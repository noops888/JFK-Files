Same Subject
(b) HR 7-1a(6)
1. I have reviewed the circumstances of the subject
incident in the context of potential impact of possible
prosecution for violation of the laws cited in paragraph 4
of OGC memo 76-4442 dated 11 August 1976. Such prosecution
in my judgment would have no direct impact on any of the
activities of this Directorate which are in support of the
national security and foreign relations of the United
States except for the intangible damage that could result
from the exposure of cover for currently active Agency 03
personnel. Mike King (O/Finance) as well as Bill Katsirubas
and (Phil James) (NE) are under (Army) cover and (Pat Maggi)
(AF) is under Air Force cover.

2. We defer to Cover and Commercial Staff for an
assessment of the damage that might accrue to cover or
cover arrangements should exposure occur from prosecution.
