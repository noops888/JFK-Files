1. Forwarded herewith for Headquarters is a document recently
received from the Chief of the Allens Police of Department II of the
10 West Berlin police concerning the Richard Case NAGELL affair. The
document was received by the Aliens Police via the mails in a letter
addressed directly to the Aliens Police in West Berlin, Othe envelope
was destroyed by the clerk who opened it ant there is therefore no
way of knowing whether it was malled in the United States or elsewhere
or who the eender was. s. It has evidently been published by NAGELL himself.

28 January 1970
Washington, D.C.
:
An editor of a trade journal, whom I first net while on
an intelligence assignment in Latin America, has urged me
for some time to make public the facts dealing with my
involvement in a conspiracy to murder the late Chief
Executive, John F. Kennedy, in 1963 and the circumstances
surrounding my arrest and imprisonment in the United States
and East Germany.. For reasons that are more personal than
advisable I can think of little else that I would like to do
better. But with the copious amount of documentation and
background material on hand, that I feel should be adduced
to in any valid treatise of the subject, it would require
writing no less than a tome, an undertaking for which I am
hardiy qualified. Then, too, there is a growing skepticism
on my part concerning the kind of reception that a topic of
this wort would elicit from a society long since inured to
violence, corruption and injustice. Still, after over six
years of relative silence, I've decided that I must say
something about all this, if only to answer the lies and
distortions concocted about me in the press. Thus, I have
compiled this small booklet, a throwaway, which may be
easily discarded at the whim of the render. In it I've
taken the liberty to set forth a reproduction of one of the
least canitized references to my cene that has appeared in
the newa media, an article printed last summer in the
OVERSEAS FAMILY, a weekly tabloid catering to U.S. service-
wen in Europe. I have utilized this particular article as a
vehicle to tell a bit of my side of the story by writing an
addendum to it.

this time, Nagell flew home to the United
States.
Now he's back where he started in
1963. when he tipped off the FBI that
Oswald was planning to assassinate Pres-
ident Kennedy..
Working through a source with access
to documents on the Nagell case, The
FAMILY has been able to reconstuct this
incredible story of the spy who couldn't
come in from the cold.

held briefly for discharging a
firearm en Federally insured
property. By that time the as-
sassination would be over and
he'd be safe.
Apparently Nageli felt police
custody would keep him safe
from the CIA and from the
aneaming. He feared the CIA
because he didn't "take care
of Oswald. He feared the
lentiary." the source smiled.
"All you have to do is be
there."
The source continued:
"In 1900 Magell's sister
wrote that she had had e

wented to know where her
husband was and why hadn't
she heard from him.
"Here is the sticky part. In

as a matter of record.
"After Nageli's tip, the FBI

danger or a threat."

"That was Orwald" This was

"After the assassination the

The FAMILY was told. "FRI..
agents insisted to Nagell that
he hadn't told them this about
Oswald or that about Oswald.
But he had."
By this time Nageli was in
Leavenworth penitentiary.
On Sept 20, 1963, aix days
before what Nagell thought
was to be the assassination
date, he went into an El Paso
benk, shot one builet into the
celing and walted outside to
assassins because he might be
considered one of them.
But the police held Nagell
longer than six days.
He was tried twice, in May
1964 and September 1966, for.
attempted robbery with force
and valence and sentenced to
the maximum of 10 years.

complained.

The letter had been sent
from a Hollywood post office

cessfully to trare it after he
gut out of Leavenworth.
On April 28, 1964, after 4%
years in prison, Nagell was re-

"You'll never get out of Berlin alive!"
The FAMILY's source said: "There were two men in uniform and two
men in civilian clothes. They asked Nagell for his passport-by name.
Then they asked for his transit visa. He didn't know what they were
talking about. So they took him off the train because he didn't have a
valid transit visa.
"Next he was driven to an East Berlin political prison for extensive
interrogation. They accused him of espionage and said they were going
to try him.
"Nagell had been told that if he was in East Germany for over three
months, his release would be effected by the agency (CIA), but he was
not told how. (In his own words he started to play crazy because he was
there over four and a half months and he began to think there was an-
other reason for his being there. He felt the CIA had deserted him and
that, quite frankly, he had been sent to Germany to get him out of sight
or to get rid of him.)
"He was released on October 23. He didn't know he was going to be
released until he was taken out of prison and driven to a Berlin check-
point identified to him as Sandarnig bruecke.

the Feb. 10, 1962, exchange of Soviet master spy Col. Rudolf Abel and

Ricey & New, a wealthy Washington lawyer, supposedly "a" represen-

sleepy he had to occasionally stand up to stay awake. From time to
time he asked to be examined by a civilian psychiatrist if there was any
question of his sanity.
"No," they said, "as far as I'm concerned you're free to go."
New spoke to the doctor in German.
The doctor kept shaking his head no-and then New to Nagell, "I think
you ought to leave for the United States. The German newspapers are
going to pick this thing up any moment and might want to talk to you. I
don't think you should talk to them."
Nagell said he wanted to go back to Zurich to pick up his belongings-
certain documents in a safe deposit box. Nagell has kept records, plenty
of them.
When Nagell was driven to Tempelhof Airport, New accompanied him
and waited until he boarded the plane. Sometime during their talk New
asked Nagell about his disability.
"Nagell is getting a 60 percent disability for service-connected
illness," the source said.

One to kill him
The FAMILY's source said: "Nagell's instructions were to take care of
Oswald. He told him he was an intelligence man, not a killer, and he
couldn't kill Oswald.
"Threats were made to Nagell which indicated to him that he had bet-
ter do what he had been instructed to do.
"Instead, he wrote about Oswald's assassination plans to FBI director
J. Edgar Hoover in Washington. Hoover didn't reply, but Nagell didn't
expect him to. He wanted that letter as a matter of record.
"After Nagell's tip, the FBI questioned Oswald and released him as
not being a danger or a threat.
Two months later Nagell heard the assassination news bulletin on the
radio. 'The FBI screwed up,' he explained. 'That was Oswald.' This was
before there was any public mention of Oswald.
"After the assassination the FBI tried to clean their skirts," The
FAMILY was told. "FBI agents insisted to Nagell that he hadn't told
them this about Oswald or that about Oswald. But he had."
By this time Nagell was in Leavenworth penitentiary.
On Sept. 20, 1963, six days before what Nagell thought was to be the
assassination date, he went into an El Paso bank, shot one bullet into
the ceiling and waited outside to be arrested. He expected to be held
briefly for discharging a firearm on federally insured property. By that
time the assassination would be over and he'd be safe.
Apparently Nagell felt police custody would keep him safe from the
CIA and from the assassins because he might be considered one of them.
But the police held Nagell longer than six days.
He was tried twice, in May 1964 and September 1966, for attempted rob-
bery with force and violence and sentenced to the maximum of 10 years.
"I was bum-rapped," Nagell complained.
"The court instructed that any attorneys retained by his relatives
would have to come under the supervision and control of court-appointed
attorneys," The FAMILY source said. "In effect, this denied him counsel
of his choice all during prison."
As prisoner A-43286-1, Nagell was allowed to write to only his sister
and a friend. He couldn't get an explanation why he wasn't allowed mail
from or to his wife and children. "They don't explain to you in Leaven-
worth pen," the FBI had questioned her a few days before about her hus-
band's activities in the Army. The FBI knew where Nagell was but didn't
tell his wife.
The letter had been sent from a Hollywood post office box, and Nagell
tried unsuccessfully to trace it after he got out of Leavenworth.
On April 28, 1964, after four and a half years in prison, Nagell was re-
leased after he had won an acquittal on appeal and flew to New York.
"We pulled a lot of strings to get your freedom," said a man who met
Nagell when he landed at Kennedy Airport. The man and his non-talking
partner gave Nagell $300 in $20 bills. "More will come where this comes
from," the unidentified men promised. "We appreciate your cooperation
in prison."
"To this day," the source
