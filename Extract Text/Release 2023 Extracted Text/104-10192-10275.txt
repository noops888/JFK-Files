2023 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, 65/6

17 November 1961
British Liaison Control Officer
SUBJECT: Recent Arrest of Movimiento revolucionario del
Pueblo (MRP) Members
REFERENCE: 10/2232 dated 8 November 1962
Information available is insufficient to evaluate the Cuban
Ministry of Interior claims that the MRP has been destroyed by the alleged
round-up of a large number of its members and the arrest of Reynaldo
SOCAS, internal coordinator. Cuban exiles have commented that
some of those listed as arrested have actually been held in custody for
as long as three months. It has been the practice of the Cuban
Government in smaller cases to imply a mere "rounding-up" of an opposition
group when in fact many of those involved have been known to have been
arrested some months before.  Ismael Leyva, coordinator of the MRP
in exile, commented to the press as follows: "The arrests have hurt our
movement very much, but this is by no means a death blow."
There is no doubt that SOCAS was under extreme pressure during
the period after his arrest and before his television appearance, which,
according to the press statement, was on a carefully edited film.
Instead of the usual "limp" program presented by the Castro government
with other known prisoners, his appearance was accompanied
with the explicit and repeated comments of the interrogators and only
a representative selection of the internal resistance activities,
voice, and that he "reconciled" with the interrogators and saved
people out of reach, i.e., in asylum or exile, or those already in custody
and beyond hope of saving.
