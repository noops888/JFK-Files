MEMO OF CONVERSATION BETWEEN
WM. GEORGE GAUDET AND BERNARD FENSTERWALD
AT WAVELAND, MISSISSIPPI, MAY 13,1975
Gaudet is 67 years of age and in poor health.
Writes for local newspaper...
Semi-retired.
During WW II, Gaudet worked as secret agent in Latin America
for Nelson Rockefeller, Coordinator of Latin American affairs under
Switched to CIA in 1947 and worked for them until 1969. During
FDR.
this time he published Latin American Newsletter and Latin American
Report, which he claims were 100% commercial ventures and not CIA
fronts. However, he travelled constantly in Latin America and
combined his commercial work with his CIA assignments; the latter,
according to him, were basically uncompensated (some expenses were
picked up by CIA) and done for patriotic purposes. There were 3 others
in the New Orleans area who did likewise.
Gaudet is a right-winger; generally disliked JFK.
Kept his CIA activities very secret, not even telling his wife.
Only told FBI in 1963. No one else.
:
Latin American Newsletter cost $15.00 per week.
Both the CIA
and the KGB had in excess of 20 subscriptions, which means that each
of them "subsidized" Gaudet to the tune of more than $15,000 annually.
38 As to JFK slaying, believes Warren Report is a fairy story
which shall become completely unglued very soon. Believes anti-Castro
forces involved. Personally believes they had a right to hate JFK.
Thinks plot was hatched soon after Bay of Pigs and came to fruition
in 1963.
As to having the Mexican Travel Permit serially next to Oswald's,
Gaudet explains that it was complete coincidence and that he never met
Oswald. He backs and fills on whether he flew to Merida or Mexico City.
What is of more interest is the fact that he was interviewed three times
by FBI about it. Before telling them anything, he checks with "Bill",
the CIA station chief in New Orleans, who, in turn, checks with Langley.
It is decided that Gaudet should answer questions re Mexican trip but
nothing more, and FBI promises to keep Gaudet's name to itself, and
save his cover. Apparently, they did so until 1972 when his name was
(inadvertently?) declassified.
Gaudet says the FBI report about his having reported on Ruby's
buying paintings from Borenstein is a complete fabrication. He didn't
know either Borenstein or Ruby and he wouldn't volunteer the time of day
to the FBI.
Gaudet.
In last week, FBI has called and is going to re-interview
For whom?
Gaudet says he never met Oswald, and that he only observed him
upon occasion. Question mark on this? In any event, he describes him
as a "miserable little creature who would do anyting for money.
Believes he was being financed hy someone. Most seriously doubts if
he could have pulled off the rifle fire in Dealey Plaza, as LHO was
terribly nervous and disorganized.

2.
Believes LHO worked both sides of the "Cuban street,"
Doesn't really admit knowing what he was up to. Rumored to have
an office in a building immediately across street from Trade Mart.
Knew LHO went to Mexico by bus.
Gaudet described the CIA set up in New Orleans in detail
Large offices with approximately fifty people. Similar to CIA
set up in all ports, unmarked office. Unlisted phone.
:
New Orleans office headed by "Bill", lawyer, prominent
family, debutante daughter. (Since learned that "Bill" is
William Burke and office is in Masonic Bldg.)
CIA New Orleans had closed circuit to Langley.
CIA only paid Gaudet's special travel expenses when their
tasks couldn't be done on his regular trips.
:
Gaudet was once flown to Langley to brief CIA on Latin
American affairs.
Laughs when he thinks of Rockefeller as head of Commission
to study either CIA or Dallas.
?
Miscellaneous & Leads
?
Ferrie knew LHO and Shaw, but Shaw wasn't CIA and had nothing
to do with Dallas.
Thinks E. Howard Hunt knows more about Dallas than any other
person he can think of. Hunt was "God" to the Cubans, and he is
Certain that CIA sent Hunt out immediately after Dallas to see what
he could find out about a "Cuban connection."
Knows of LHO's cousin, Marilyn Murrett in an intelligence
connection.
WHY?
Says Sergio Sergio Arcacha Smith should be cross-examined if alive
and subpoenable.
