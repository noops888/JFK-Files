1. David DUBOIS is no doubt identical with David Graham McCANNS,
(201-271141) born 9 March 1925 in Seattle, Washington to Shadrach and Shirley
Graham McCANNS. HECANNS is known to have used the names David GRAHAM, David
G. McCanns DUBOIS and David DUBOIS. He is described as 5 feet 9inches tall,
slender build, with a scar over his right eye and a pock marked face. McCANNS
married Clarise Johnson on 1 May 1949 and was divorced in September 1952.
2. Records on file indicate that ECCANHS has associated through the years
with communist dominated or inspired organisations such as the Young Progressives
of America, the American Labor Party and the World Federation of Democratic
Youths. In 1950 he attended the World Student Congress at Prague, & meeting
in China of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the Soviet Anniversary
Celebration in Koscow. At the time of HeCANNS visit to Moscow, pro-communist
and anti-USA statements were attributed to KeCANNS over Radio Moscow and in the
*Peoples China. In 1952/53 he was reported to have been a press operator for
the communist organ "Daily Worker."
3. In July 1950, HOCANNS was issued a passport for six months travel in
France, England and Switserland for the purpose of social service study. In
1952, his passport vas picked up by ODACID and was found to contain visas to
France, Czechoslovakia, Switserland, Austria and China.

4. In 1959 MCCANNS applied for and received a second passport for three
months tourist travel to Meland and France. McCANNS failed to answer questions
in his application as to whether he was then or had ever been a member of the
Communist Party. In October 1959 ODENVY learned that McCANNS was enrolled in
Peking University and had been there since September 1959. ODENVI further
learned that HcCANNS planned to study in Peking for three years and then remain
in China to work.
5. During an interview on 12 September 1957 by ODENVY, HeCANNS was asked
if he had ever been a member of the CP to which he replied "It is none of your
business. In answer to a further question as to whether he considered the
CP to be a subversive organisation, McCANNS replied "I consider the CP to be
the same as any other political party and it is none of your business if I
have ever belonged to it." KcCANNS refused to answer any further questions
and terminated the interview.
6. During an interview on 10 November 1960 with MCCANNS mother,
Mrs. W. B. B. DUBOIS, the latter stated that McCANNS was no longer residing in
Peiring but was unemployed and touring France.
7. The statement in paragraph 1 of reference that his wife's first name
is Shirley is possibly incorrect, inasmuch as all records on hand indicate that
the name of MeCANNS mother was Shirley Graham McCANNS, who married a
Dr. W. B. B. DUBOIS in February 1958. If McCANNS has married someone by the
name of Shirley it is not reflected by any documents on hand at this time.
8. Dr. W. E. B. DUBOIS, step-father of McCANNS, is well known to ODENVY
and his communist affiliations are well substantiated by numerous documents.
Mrs. Shirley Graham MOCANNS DUBOIS also has a long record of association with
communist organizations and has been identified as a communist in a mumber
of documents.
9. For your information, ODENVI has requested that we report on a
continuing basis any information we may obtain concerning MeCANKS activities
while abroad. Please pouch Headquarters any further information you may have
acquired on McCANNS for transmission to ODENVI.
