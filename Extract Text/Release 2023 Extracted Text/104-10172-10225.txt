1. (Martinstated that ADLADLE has "settled in" very well
in the U.K. and that his current attitude is good.06 To date
he has posed no major "personality" problems. Hartin person-
ally, has handled all of the contact with him for MI-5] since
his arrival in the U.K. AKLADLE's wife apparently loved 9
London and has been somewhat dissatisfied since they have been
travelling about "the provinces" and living in the country.
2. During the first week in July ABLADLE began his first
06.08
"work" since his arrival in the U.K. He has been preparing
his analysis of and "conclusions" on the Penkovsky case.
During this period he has been primarily seen by John Quine,
deputy to Geoffrey Hinton, Chief of the MI-6 CE Section.
ABLADLE, according to Quine, is convinced that Penkovsky was
a controiled Soviet agent from the beginning and is preparing
29 (HI-6 were letting AELADLE get this out of his system before
paper to support his views. According to Quine, MI-5 and 06, 29
pushing him on other matters.

3. According to both Martin and Quine, AELADLE is a
very voracious reader of the British press and has been fol-
lowing recent events in the security field with a great deal
of interest and attention.

4. Hatin feels that AELADLE realizes that in the U.K.
he is "closer to the front lines in a security sense" and is
therefore more amenable to discipline over his activities and
movements. In addition, AELADLE apparently already realizes
that London is partially "in the provinces" in the world scene
and that he was much closer to the center of world events while
near Washington.

5. AELADLE, according to Martin is already thinking
about a possible rotura visit to the U.8.3" sometime in the fall"
and has on several occasions asked Martin what he thought his
reception would be in Washington. Martin believes that AELADLE
realizes he burned quite a few of his bridges through his

AELADLE has said that he hoped the "past could be forgotten"
and is anxious that there would be no reference to past
difficulties if and when he came to the U.S. for a visit.

6. According to Martin AKLADLE is not eager for sur-
facing at the present time. He also commented that he
hoped in his future "work" that one subject could be fully
covered before shifting to another. Apparently he considered
the past systea a "hit and miss" method which was sometimes
confusing and disconcerting.

7. Martinstated that AELADLE's files still remain
sealed and are kept in a safe in Martin's personal office.
