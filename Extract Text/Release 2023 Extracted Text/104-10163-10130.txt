answering Artime file
1. DUSKIRT-2 HAS ASKED IF WE COULD OBTAIN FOR HIM THE CURRENT
ADDRESS OF MANUEL ARTIME. D-2 WAS FRIEND AND COLLABORATOR OF
ARTIME FROM 1959 UNTIL THEY LOST CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER IN 1968.
WHEN D-2 FIRST CAME TO PERU HE CARRIED LETTER SIGNED BY ARTIME
IDENTIFYING HIM AS ARTIME PERSONAL REP IN PERU.
2. D-2 WANTS TO CONTACT ARTIME TO ASK HIS HELP IN OBTAINING
NICARAGUAN PASSPORT. HE CLAIMS ARTIME RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMOZA
IS SUCH THAT ARTIME COULD OBTAIN FOR D-2 NICARAGUAN PASSPORT AND
PERHAPS SOME TYPE OF HONORARY CONCUL DESIGNATION. D-2 WILL WRITE
LETTER TO ARTIME EXPLAINING HIS SITUATION AND WILL ASK STATION
TO POUCH LETTER TO MIAMI FOR MAILING THERE EITHER DIRECTLY TO
ARTIME OR TO D-2 SISTER FOR HER TO DELIVER PERSONALLY TO ARTIME.
3. AS ABOVE INDICATES, D-2 REMAINS PREOCCUPIED WITH FACT HE
DOES NOT POSSESS VALID PASSPORT. HE HAS TRIED NUMEROUS SCHEMES
TO OBTAIN SAME WITHOUT SUCCESS. HE STRONGLY FEELS HE MUST HAVE
DOCUMENTATION TO LEAVE PERU IF NECESSARY. HE WORRIES ABOUT

POSSIBILITY OF ONE DAY BEING ARRESTED, PERHAPS AS RESULT HIS
BKHERALD ACTIVITY. AND DEPORTED TO CUBA BY LEFTIST PERUVIAN
GOVT. HE ADMITS THAT HIS EXPERIENCES IN CUBA AFTER CASTRO'S
TAKEOVER COLOR HIS PERCEPTION OF THE DANGER IN HIS CURRENT
SITUATION BUT HE IS NOT WILLING TO REMAIN VULNERABLE TO SIMILAR
DEVELOPMENT IN PERU. EVENTS OF THE PAST FEW DAYS WILL OF COURSE
NOT REASSURE HIM RE THE SITUATION HERE.
4. OTHER THAN ARTIME GAMBIT, ONLY TWO POSSIBILITIES FOR
OBTAINING PASSPORT WHICH REMAIN OPEN TO D-2 ARE PERUVIAN CITIZEN-
SHIP OR GOING TO CUBAN EMBASSY AND ASKING THAT THEY RENEW HIS
EXPIRED CUBAN PASSPORT. HE REJECTS IDEA PERUVIAN CITIZENSHIP,
CLAIMING HE STILL PLANS EVENTUALLY RETURN TO LIVE IN UNITED STATES
BUT ALSO BECAUSE HIS FEARS ABOUT ULTIMATE DESTINATION PERUVIAN
REVOLUTION AND POSSIBILITY MARXIST DICTATORSHIP COMING TO POWER
HERE. HE AND STATION ARE NATURALLY RELUCTANT HAVE HIM APPROACH
CUBAN EMBASSY. THERE PROBABLY THICK FILE ON HIM IN HAVANA AND HE WOULD
NOT WISH CALL THEIR ATTENTION TO HIS PRESENCE HERE. HOWEVER THIS
OPTION MUST BE EXAMINED AND THEREFORE WOULD BE HELPFUL IF HQS
COULD PROVIDE INFO UN EXPERIENCE OTHERS SUCH AS D-2, FORMERLY

1. AS ADDRESSEES AWARE, WHEN AMWORLD WAS CLOSED
OUT TWO YEARS AGO, AMBIDDY-1 WAS AUTHORIZED TO HOLD
ROUGH EQUIVILENT OF WEAPONS TO ARM ONE RIFLE COMPANY.
WEAPONS STORED AT THE MONKEY POINT OPS BASE, AT EL PLUFF
SUPPORT CASE, AND IN MANAGUA. ABOUT ONE YEAR AGO, MONKEY
POINT BASE WAS CLOSED AND WEAPONS THERE MOVED TO EL BLUFF.
STORAGE IN SEALED CONCRETE VAULT UNDER THE FLOOR OF
SAFEHOUSE WHICH IS ON UNINHABITED SIDE OF BLUFF NEXT TO
AIRSTRIP BUILT BY AMWORLD. STRIP IS 1,883 BY 50 FEET
WITH CLAY BASE MIXED WITH NATURAL ROCK.
2. ARMS IN MANAGUA HAVE BEEN STORED IN A SAFEHOUSE
OUTSIDE OF CITY AND CONSIST OF TWO WOODEN CRATES, EACH
ABOUT 150 POUNDS AND 37 BY 25 BY 14 INCHES. APPROXIMATE

4. AMBIDDY-1 CONTACTED JAMES D. ZABOTH 4 MARCH, SAID
HE CLOSING OUT ALL HIS STATIONKEEPERS IN NICARAGUA, DID
NOT WANT TO ABANDON WEAPONS TO FALL INTO WRONG HANDS, NOR
TO GIVE THEM TO NIC GOVT. GENERAL SOMOZA KNEW AMWORLD WAS
LEAVING BEHIND SOME RESERVE EQUIPMENT AND WOULD KEEP
ENOUGH WEAPONS FOR LOCAL SECURITY. HE DID NOT KNOW NUMBERS
AND TYPES REMAINING. AMBIDDY-1 ASKED IF WOFACT WISHED TO
RECOVER WEAPONS, OTHERWISE HE WOULD HAVE TO DUMP THEM IN
OCEAN. ZABOTH, AMBIDDY-1 AND AMJAVA-4, WHO IN MANAGUA ON
OTHER BUSINESS, VISITED BLUFF ISLAND 6 MARCH TO CHECK
SITUATION. IF HQS WISHES RECOVER WEAPONS, MOST FEASIBLE
METHOD IS BY AIR. A CARIBOU OR C-123 TYPE AIRCRAFT COULD
LAND ON BLUFF STRIP, LOAD WEAPONS AT NIGHT AND FLY THEM
OUT NEXT MORNING. IF HQS DOES NOT WISH RECOVER WEAPONS,
AMBIDDY-1 COULD BE TOLD TO MAKE OWN ARRANGEMENTS TO DUMP
WEAPONS AT SEA.
5. DESPITE AMBIDDY-1 DESIRE NOT INFORM SOMOZA ABOUT
ARMS CACHE, COS FEELS THAT SOMOZA SHOULD BE INFORMED IF

DECISION IS THAT ARMS SHOULD BE RECOVERED. SOMOZA
COULD BE TOLD THAT "SOME EQUIPMENT" LEFT BEHIND BY AMWORLD
GROUP NOW STORED AT BLUFF AND LNHARP WISHES RECOVER. BELIEVE
HE WOULD AGREE TO AIRCRAFT PICKUP AS PROPOSED ABOVE. IN
STATION OPINION BLACK RECOVERY WITHOUT SOMOZA KNOWLEDGE
TOO RISKY. STATION ALSO FEELS THESE WEAPONS SHOULD BE
REMOVED FROM CENTRAL AMERICA LEST THEY FALL INTO WRONG HANDS.
