1. Permission has been granted by ODENVY to pass to the INARITIONS the
following information from its reports on Subject.
a. Richard Thomas Gibson, American Negro journalist, born 13 May 1931
in Los Angeles, California, was active in the New York chapter of the Fair Play
for Cuba Committee (FFCC) from the time of its organization in the spring of 1960
until his departure for Algeria in the fall of 1962. The FFCC has been supported
by the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) and Gibson has identified himself as well with
other front groups in the United States supported by the SWP. (The Socialist
Workers Party has been designated by the Attorney General of the United States
pursuant to Executive Order 10450.)
...?
b. Gibson apparently began to lose interest in the FPCC, partly because
of inadequate pay and operating funds, by the spring of 1962 when he stated that
he intended to leave the organization in the fall. Gibson left Ottawa, Ontario,
Canada, in September 1962 for Algeria where he planned to work as a journalist for
several South American and European newspapers (none identified) and to travel to
Morocco, Ghana, Guinea and Mali before returning to the United States. Eventually,
both Gibson and his wife were given posts with Revolution Africaine, a journal
reportedly financed by the Algerian Government.
c. Gibson's English wife, Sarah, was identified with the "English
Bureau" of Revolution Africaine as of February 1963. Prior to his departure from
the United States Gibson served as Executive Secretary of the Liberation Committee
for Africa as well as serving as acting Executive Secretary of the FFCC. The
Liberation Committee for Africa is an organization which is nationwide with the
aim of helping "African freedom fighters" and promoting awareness of a common
heritage for Afro-Americans and Africans.
2. ODENVY would appreciate receiving any additional information concerning
the whereabouts and activities of Gibson which may come to your attention.
