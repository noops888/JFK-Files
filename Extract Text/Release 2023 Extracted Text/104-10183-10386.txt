2023 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
SECRET
13 March 1963
MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: ANTRINK, (Leonardo)
Status Report
1. The four principals are in a safe house, "way out
of Miami." They began training on 4 March 1963.
2. A training officer (like Ramirez) arrived at WAVE
on 1 March 1963. He will do all type training. WAVE
will handle rest.
3. Cover was arranged for two men:
A. Dr. MORENO resigned from HEW and was picked
up by cover firm in New York.
B. Enrique CAYANO resigned job in Pasadena and
moved, wife too, to Miami area.
C. Other two men had no cover problems.
4. A P.O. Box in New York City arranged for all
principals. Also arrangements have been made to mail
their letters from New York City.
5. We have now received PIQ's on all the principals.
PIQ's on all of them will be in order shortly. Two of them
already had POA's.
6. On 4 March 1963, I notified Bob Hurwitch that
this operation was off the ground and that training would
begin immediately. Hurwitch asked how we handled Dr.
MORENO's employment with HEW. I told him we had the Dr.
resign and that we would attempt to secure his re-employment
either with HEW or another U.S. Government agency.
7. Since writing this memo six paragraphs a cable,
received 13 March 1963, confirmed our cover arrangements
for ANTRINK/14 (DIAZ Isalgue) and ANTRUNK (GARCIA Perez).
Also, as anticipated, we will have to pay those men through
those cover companies. This is presently being arranged.

8. To the best of my knowledge we are still aiming
for infiltration sometime in April. WAVE has not otherwise
reported, and it appears that all is proceeding routinely.
