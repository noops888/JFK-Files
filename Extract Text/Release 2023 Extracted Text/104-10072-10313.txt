1. Following FILOMENOR's recent visit, the Station had a much better
idea of MICHAOS activities. This dispatch is a round-up of our most recent
actions against this target.
2. In a meeting with KRHOLLY/8 on 17 December, in addition to the
routine discussion and passage of information on the Soviet Bloc people,
JAVILLONER presented KRHOLLY/8 with a memo (based on Headquarters 776)
requesting information on and watchlisting of the MHCHAOS group who were
destined for Africa and were likely to visit Lagos. This was given after
JAVILLONER had briefed KRHOLLY/8 on the "Weathermen", the "Black Panthers"
versus the "Martin Luther King" group, the "Minutemen" and the "Mafia",
indicating the advocation of violence of each group and the need for us to
keep track of their external movements to enable us to protect the stability
of our country as he was trying to do in his. JAVILLONER approached him then
on the possibility of getting visa information on US Citizens who intended to
visit Nigeria. KRHOLLY/8 said that this would be a difficult problem because
many US people picked up visas in other countries such as Italy, France,
Chana, etc. JAVILLONER then asked if he could, at a minimum, push for the
compilation of US arrivals/departures just as he did with the Soviets, since
in some cases the "bad" Americans could present a threat to his country as
well as our own and that by compiling such travel data and monitoring their
activities centrally, perhaps we would both benefit from the effort. He
seemed agreeable and said he would attempt to do what he could personally
and would bring this up with his hierarchy.
3. While KRHOLLY/8 was still motivated with this theme, JAVILLONER
mentioned that many of the so-called Black Panthers were in reality "Communist
Agents" and were working for Communism and not for the Civil Rights Movement.
We then cited the case of JULIA WRIGHT HERVE and told KRHOLLY/8 that she had
been living at the Nigerian Institute for International Affairs; working for
the Ministry of Information on Ikoyi and also from the main office; but that
she and her husband (who were ostensibly working to help the Nigerians and

working with them via Sam IKOKU and the Ministry of Information) were known
members of the "Curiel Apparat" and were using Nigeria, the Black Panthers
and any other group or person, such as NKRUMAH, to further their Communistic
goals and that he would be well advised to look into the activities of these
people and contacts, since they were undoubtedly involved in subversion and
using their jobs and assistance to the FMG as a cover for their real aims.
HRHOLLY/8 was aroused and said that he would definitely get onto this matter.
He then volunteered that a "Carmichael" had been in Lagos a few months ago
and, upon questioning, he said he didn't know if it was "Stokely" or his
brother. JAVILLONER then told him that this was a case in point and that if
he had any system of monitoring these people he could help us run down known
| criminals, just as we would help them run down any criminals that landed in
our country.
4. As noted above, KRHOLLY/8 seemed eager and willing to assist, but
it is dubious that he will be able to make any real progress on his own or
convince his superiors to make a concerted and formal effort to provide us
with the information we would like to have, especially the follow-up locally
of the activities of MHCHAOS people when they arrive and start moving around
town. However, the initial reaction was positive and perhaps if we keep
plugging away, we can make a break-through in this area.
5. FILOMENOR reported that the Nigerian Charge' in Algiers had been
involved with MHCHAOS target personalities. Our records indicate the Charge'
at the present time is: James Duro Olufemi SOKOYA; born 1933 at Ojowo,
Iebu-Igbo; one of ten Nigerians to attend a course for diplomats (Interna-
tional law and French lessons) in Geneva, based on a bilateral program for
technical assistance. SOKOYA was Assistant Chief of Protocol before his
present assignment and, according to the LNCUFF Assistant Political Officer,
was very friendly and helpful to LNCUFF.
