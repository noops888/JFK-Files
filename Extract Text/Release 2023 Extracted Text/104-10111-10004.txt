1. Subject live address in name Daniel L. CARSWELL, (14 Eton
Place, Eastchester), NY, was originally set up in August 1960 by
MFO. MFO was advised that there would probably be no mail, and
that should any inquiry be made, the householder should affirm
that CARSWELL is an engineering company employee, has been living
at the residence for about two years, originally came from Penn-
sylvania, is about 40 years old, and is single. He supposedly
is away on a business trip.

2. The given resdience is the home of Join and Eileen
BARRY.) He was born in 1917, and is employed by a Chevrolet
Sales Company in the Bronx, N.Y.
2. In Sept. 1960, SAC/MFO was advised that Subject had been
arrested, and was requested to brief (BARRY) the householder, con-
cerning the details of the cover story then rpovided by CCD, which
differed from the original story provided by JMARC (above) in
that the fact the CARSWELL was employed by the firm of Victor
VACHUTA in NYC was added, and the story was altered to the extent
that CARSWELL had been an Air Force civilian employee until May
is not apparent how long CARSWELL is supposed to have lived at the hooll
1960. He had been employed by VACHUTA since September 1960. It efined

Eastchester) address, and the license was issued in August 1957.

3. MFO was requested to disclose no GOLIATH interest to(BARRY)
and that the above cover story should be used in the event of any
inquiries concerning CARSWELL. Thefile notes that in the event the
Cubans break CARSWELL, and his true name and employment come out,
some decision will have to be made as to what to tell BARRY at that
time.

5. Suggest that we advise MFO of possibilities of inquiriy
at this time, and have them affirm with householder that if
which is not

swanqueried (BARRY) acknowledge that CARSWELL has resided there; that
he left on a business trip to in August 1960; that BARRY has not
heard from him since; that (BARRY) had checked with his employer,
who advised (BARRY that CARSWELL had been delayed and would be
out of town for several more months. I suggest that whether or not
of BARRY) is aware from newspapers or through MFO that CARSWELL is in
prison, he be advised not to offer this information to inquirers,
but to play an innocent party in the whole matter of the imprisonment.

6. It is alee suggested that we attempt to ascertain through
PSD and CI, just what mail CARSWELL anticipates may be directed to
the Eastchester) address, i.e., to whom it will be addressed. On
one of the earlier cables from the field, the station advised that
CARSWELL's story was that he had no relative and was single. The
latest cable makes mention of letters to CARSWELL's relatives and
the Castchester) address.
