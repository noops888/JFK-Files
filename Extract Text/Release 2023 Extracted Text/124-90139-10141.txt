U) The captioned matter was publicized to some extent and we
have checked with the Army and with Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
in order to determine if any worthwhile information was acquired
from an examination of the plane crash, bearing in mind two
Cuban officials were among the victims. We have been told by the
Army that pertinent documents were eventually made available to CIA
on 4-11-63. Harold Swenson CIA, furnished the following to the
Liaison Agent.)
Bolivian, Peruvian and United States officials reached
the site of the crash on 3-17-63. A pistol with a silencer was
found on_the body of Enrique Valdez, one of the Cubans who was
Tikilled. The Peruvian officials confiscated numerous documents
and have made the material available to CIA. CIA assumes that the
Peruvian officials did not withhold any material. An examination
of the documents so far has failed to disclose any information
suggesting any leads in the United States. Furthermore examination
has not produced any data relating to Cuban intelligence activities.
(Swenson stated that CIA is still in the process of
studying the material He was informed by the Liaison Agent that
the Bureau wants to be advised if any information is disclosed
concerning Cuban operations in the United States and that we are
very much interested in anything which might directly or indirectly
assistus in covering anti-Castro activities in this country.
