in this office revealed the following information relevant
to the Subject. While a large number of documents are
available which mention King, the majority are dated after
his death and in some way are related to world reaction to
his assassination which was on 4 April 1968, prior to the
implementation of the MHCHAOS program, 4 July 1968.
