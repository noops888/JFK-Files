SAN JUAN:
.............
AT SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO
Will interview MANOLO RAY, head of the Cuban
Revolutionary Junta (JURE), whose identity is well known
to San Juan. (Colonel WENDELL JOHNSON Who serves
as Liaison man between Dr. JOSE MIRO CARDONA, President
of the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC), and some
United States agencies, including CHAY has advised that
MIRO CARDONA is opposed to RAY. Other information has
been previously received reflecting that MIRO CARDONA has
described RAY as a Leftist, and that he would never permit
RAY to join the CRC. Some of these remarks have allegedly
been made through public media. Investigation by Miami
in the case on JURE has disclosed that RAY was allegedly
in Miami some time prior to the bombing incident of
November 20, 1962.
RAY's representative in Miami, ROGELIO CISNEROS,
has been interviewed, but claimed to possess no pertinent
information.
ور
San Juan should attempt to ascertain if RAY is
in any way implicated as a conspirator or otherwise, and
if deemed advisable, request the Bureau to authorize
giving him a polygraph interview.

past, and was allegedly sent by PRIO on two assassina-
tion attempts against BATISTA.

9. Will locate and interview CARLOS RODRIGUEZ

States Government agencies, including CIA (See
Administrative Section, this report.)

JESUS GONZALEZ CARTAS and
HUMBERTO RODRIGUEZ DIAZ
On January 7, 1963, JESUS GONZALEZ CARTAS
and-HUMBERTO RODRIGUEZ DIAZ, who have been regarded
as principal suspects in this case, voluntarily came to
the Miami Office, proclaimed their innocence, and offered
to take another polygraph interview examination. They
were instructed to call back later that evening or
early the following morning for a specific appointment.
Special Agents EDWIN L. SWEET and GEORGE E. DAVIS, JR.,
on January 9, 1963, went to their apartment, 721 S. W..
5th Street, Apartment 3, Miami, at which time both stated
they had consulted an attorney and had been advised not
to again take a polygraph interview examination. Never-
theless, they claimed they were innocent of the MIRO
CARDONA bombing incident.
On January 7, 1963, SERGIO CASTRO GUERRA signed
a polygraph waiver and a consent to search his home,
but it has not been deemed practical or necessary to proceed
with either of these courses of action, due to results of
interview with him.

On January 2, 1963, Special Agent GEORGE E.
DAVIS, JR., met with (Colonel WENDELL JOHNSON United
States Army (Retired), who serves as Liaison Officer
