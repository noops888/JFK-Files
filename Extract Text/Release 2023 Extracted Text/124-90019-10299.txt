NY T-2 mentioned in enclosed LHM is MICHAEL J. P.
MALONE, Vice-President, Cznarkow-Rionda Company, 120 Wall
Street, NYC, whose identity is concealed as it is deemed
advisable since he is in regular contact with CIA and had (U)
reques
been in regular contact wit RORKE at the cus
SP-7mac/97518
of CT
From personal knowledge of ALEX RORKE, JR., the
NYO is convinced that if RORKE were alive he would somehow
manage to contact his wife or friends. Although RORKE in
the past has been accused of doing many reckless and unthinking
things, nevertheless, he was a devoted husband and father and
always was in contact with his family whenever traveling.
