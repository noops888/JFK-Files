Cuba
1. An informal meeting of the Interdepartmental Subcommittee
(Psychological Programs) on Cuban Affairs was convened in
Room 7519, New State at 1430 hours, 30 December 1963. The
agenda for the meeting was not pre-announced. Present from
State were Chairman Bowdler, Sylvester, and Montenegro;
from CIA, Tilton and Holloway, from USIA, Murphy; and the
undersigned.
2. The following topics were discussed:
a. CUTAL (Unified Labor Federation for Latin America)
meeting scheduled for Rio de Janeiro, 24 - 28 January 1964.
Mr. Montenegro, State labor advisor for Latin America,
described the anticipated meeting as a "founding" assemblage
of left-wing labor leaders, socialists, and communists who
will attempt to resolve their differences. State believes
that there will be a concerted effort by the communists
to wrest the leadership of the fledgling federation from
Mexican socialist elements. Following actions were
discussed:
(1) State to cable US Ambassador to Brazil to
ascertain the degree to which local (not national)
governmental elements will support disruptive and
harassing actions before and during the meeting.
(2) State to circularize Latin American posts
with the suggestion that local influences be brought
to bear in order to discourage country delegates
from attending the meeting.
(3) USIA to consider VOA broadcasts to Latin
America in order to exploit exposes of Cuban,
East German, and Chinese Communist labor conditions.
(4) CIA to continue black propaganda operations
which suggest postponement of the meeting.

Reference:
Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee of Cuban
Affairs: Possible Retaliatory Actions by the Castro
Government (U)
Memorandum from the Coordinator of Cuban Affairs
Dept of State, subject as above, 13 Sep 63
In response to reference memorandum, outlined below is the
status of existing contingency plans for those priority situations agreed
upon at our meeting of September 12, 1963. The numbering of the para-
graphs below corresponds to the format utilized in the attachment to
reference memorandum and includes those actions for which Department
of Defense specific or related military contingency plans exist.
"A. Actions Against U. S. Targets in Cuba
"4. Harassment of Guantanamo
"(a) Cutting off of the water supply"
COMMENT:
A minimum of approximately 20 days supply of water is
maintained in reserve storage at the naval base. Provision is made
for the emergency resupply of water by tanker, which would require
a maximum of eighteen days and which would be implemented on order
of CINCLANTFLT. In addition, evacuation of non-essential personnel
in 24 hours or less can be accomplished if directed.
"(b) Closing access to the base by Cuban workers
who commute"

purpose of substantially reducing the time required for the U. S.
fighter aircraft to reach the scene. Such overflights may be author-
ized only by specifically designated commanders.
"5. Attack on staging areas employed by exiles in the
Caribbean"
COMMENT: With regard to Castro attacks on areas in Latin America,
plans exist for the U. S. military to respond to requests for assistance
by Latin American governments subject to U. S. Governmental approval
There is also an arrangement for the interchange of information between
the U. S. Coast Guard and British naval forces with regard to possible
staging areas which may be used by exiles in the Bahamas.
"E. Actions Against Targets in the US
"1. Sabotage or terroristic bombings"
COMMENT: The level of intensity of such actions contemplated within
the context of the paper is not considered to exceed the capabilities of
law enforcement agencies to control. There are military contingency
plans to protect against this type of activity at a much higher level of
intensity.
"2. Jamming of US radio stations"
COMMENT: There are standing operating procedures to overcome
interference and jamming methods employed against military communi-
cations.
The summaries of actions set forth above are essentially defensive
reactions to Cuban initiatives. There are, of course, existing and related
military plans, retaliatory in nature, which range up to and include a full
scale military invasion of Cuba.
It was generally agreed at the September 13, 1963 meeting of
the Committee that the most likely actions of the Cuban government are
those which would not provoke United States retaliation seriously and
immediately endangering the Castro regime. It appears more likely
that Castro might intensify his support of subversive forces in Latin

through action taken in self defense by a wounded
sentry or those assisting him, through increased

Naval Base, Guantanamo. The precise nature of
the U.S. response cannot be determined in advance.

Injury or death to a sentry is one thing, a continued
sniping fusillade from a number of persons is another
"(e) Sabotaging of base facilities".
COMMENT Extensive security measures are taken to
prevent such sabotage by the Commander U.S.
Naval Base, Guantanamo. The nature of the action
taken would depend upon the nature of the
sabotage and be designed to assure the continued
functioning of the Base.
"B. Actions Against U.S. Aircraft and Shipping
"1. Harassment of U.S. Shipping using Yucatan Channel,
Florida Straits, Windward Passage"
COMMENT The rules of engagement, which have been
approved by the highest national authority
provide that ships or aircraft ordered to the
area may take immediate protective measures_
Including pursuit to, but not into, Cuban air
space or territorial waters. Commanders are
not authorized to organize deliberately a
pursuing force. U.S. pilots are not authorized
to attack unless either they or the ship they
are defending is endangered by Cuban attack.
In the event Cuban aircraft limit their action
to harassment, U.S. pilots are limited to making
their presen√ße known by flying close aboard the
Cuban plane.
"C. Actions Against Cuban Exiles
"1. Shooting down of pirate planes, possibly of US
registry.
"2. Hot pursuit of or attack on raiding planes over
the high seas or another country's territory.

ment in retaliation for Cuban exile raids" was also
requested. The furnished list of possible retaliatory
actions by the Castro government were of "the level of

had in mind by the most likely "level of intensity"
was that level which would not provoke the United States
into taking extensive countermeasures which might seriously

TOPANSEDENTIAL
than risk direct confrontation with the United States.
In
the long run, such action is more dangerous and difficult
to combat, and in the short run is less likely to provoke
immediate and effective United States retaliation. Such
actions would be in keeping with Castro's repeated declara-
tions that Cuba is the main source of guidance inspiration
for the "inevitable" Latin American revolution. Whereas an
inflamed American public opinion over the killing of even a
few sentries might require strong countermeasures, the
training of a greater number of Latin American guerrillas
than the 1500 or more trained in fiscal year 1962, probably
would not. Nor is it likely that the return of those trainees
to Latin American countries, their establishment of guerrilla
training bases, recruitment of additional personnel, and
engagement in insurgency actions would be as immediately
provocative as interference with the water supply at Guantanamo.
Similarly, closing access to the naval base Cuban workers who
commute would deprive Castro of a source of foreign exchange.
While such items as, "the harassment of air traffic into and out
of Guantanamo," or "the harassment of US aircraft operating in
the vicinity of or overflying Cuba," might be added to the list,
it is considered that specific provocative actions are less
likely and less dangerous than the intensification of support
to subversive forces in Latin America. Such action not only
is in keeping with the declared communist intention to support
"national liberation movements of oppressed peoples" but may
be done by means which avoid an invitation to overt US military
countermeasures which would endanger the Castro regime. Thus,
they are considered as of that level of intensity which places
them in the most likely category as well as being in the
category of most dangerous to the long range interests of the
United States.
