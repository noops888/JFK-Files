supported airborne ranger units under Tung's command and situated in or

near Saigon. Support will no longer be provided such units unless they are
placed under JGS control and committed to field operations

conducted through Col Tung, This transfer is contributory to the
objectives of bringing these Ops under JGS control and reducing Col. Tung's
independent power. Coordinated Interagency paper which supplements
