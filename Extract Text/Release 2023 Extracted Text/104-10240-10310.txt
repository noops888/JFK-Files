many of the exiles' well-known views about the economic situation in
Venesuela and argues that President Romulo Betancourt is in reality a
Communist himself who is deliberately trying to ruin the country, thereby
explaining his reluctance to take fira action against the Communists.
The opinion is expressed that the "authentic" FALE is composed of all.
opponents to the regime and that it is controlled by an anti-Comamist
majority, but that leftists and Corssunists have committed many acts of
terrorisa "usurping" the name of the FALE. Such a view is not supported
by mumerous Station reports which show the FALK to be a Comsunist-
directed organization composed principally of members of the PCV. It
should be noted that one of the principal objectives of the Communists
at present is to persuade the public that the PCV does not control the
FALE and that it is really a grouping of all forces opposed to the present
government who have had to resort to such pethods because of the
undemocratic nature of the Betancourt government. They have evidently
had some success in this respect and recently the head of the CIKASH
24 (liaison) organization told the case officer that he thought there were
as many rightist opponents to the regine es leftists involved in FALK
activities.
2. Because there are so many contradictions and dubious assaptions
in the entire report, the Station does not consider it suitable for
dissemination.
