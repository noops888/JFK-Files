HAD ATTEMPTED TO BLOCK THE RELEASE OF THE DOCUMENTS; REGRET THAT
WE WERE UNSUCCESSFUL.

*CITY IN TIMEFRAME OF THE<JFK ASSASSINATION. MOST SIGNIFICANTLY,
FROM A DAMAGE STANDPOINT, THE ARTICLE STATES " THE CIA HAS TRIED
TO KEEP SECRET ITS WIRETAP OPERATION, WHICH WAS CARRIED OUT WITHS
THE COOPERATION OF THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT. THE AGENCY HAS ARGUED
THAT DISCLOSING SUCH PAST ACTIVITIES MIGHT ENDANGER SIMILAR
ONGOING OPERATIONS, IN MEXICO CITY OR ELSEWHERE." WOULD
APPRECIATE STATION'S INPUT ON ANY REACTION BY
(PARTICULARLY KDSOMBRERO) OR UNILATERAL ASSETS TO THIS FURTHER
