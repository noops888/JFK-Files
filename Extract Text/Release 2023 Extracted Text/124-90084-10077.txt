QUESTIONNAIRE PREPARED BY THE INSTITUTE FOR CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC
FORMATION (IFEDEC) CONCERNING THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN EACH OF
THE SIX CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES.
LAUREANOBATISTA, THE
CR
IFEDEC REPRESENTATIVE AT THE SEMINAR, REQUESTED THAT REPRESENTA-
TIVES FROM EACH OF THE COUNTRIES PREPARE WRITTEN REPLIES TO THE
QUESTIONNAIRE.
2. COSTA RICAN AND NICARAGUAN REPRESENTATIVES, PARTICULARLY
JORGE XMONGE OF COSTA RICA, REACTED IN AN EXTREMELY NEGATIVE
AND SUSPICIOUS FASHION TO THE IFEDEC QUESTIONNAIRE AND REFUSED TO
PROVIDE WRITTEN ANSWERS.
OTHER REPRESENTATIVES HAD LITTLE DESIRE
TO PROVIDE WRITTEN ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONNAIRE BUT GENERALLY DID
THOSE
NOT REACT AS STRONGLY AS DID THE COSTA RICANS AND NICARAGUANS.
MOST OPPOSED TO BATISTA'S REQUEST EXPRESSED THE VIEW THAT THE
QUESTIONNAIRE WAS AN IFEDEC PLOY TO OBTAIN INFORMATION CONCERNING
THE SITUATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND THEY DUBBED THE QUESTIONNAIRE
EFFORT "OPERATION CAMELOT,"
BATISTA EXPLAINED THAT THE INFORMATION
VEN

REQUESTED WAS REQUIRED BY THE LATIN AMERICAN CENTER FOR INFORMATION
(CIDAL), AN ORGANIZATION RECENTLY FOUNDED IN CARACAS BY THE AMERICAN
CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC ORGANIZATION (ODCA) AND HEADED BY BATISTA.
