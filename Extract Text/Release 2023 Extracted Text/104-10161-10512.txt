(C) Agency Operator transferred a call from James A. Sherman,
Bradenton, FL., (813) 748-3232, who advised that his brother
Adrian F. Sherman expired as a result of a heart attack on 23
September 1978 at his apartment in Monterey, CA. Mr. Sherman
further advised that his brother, presently retired, worked under
contract as an advisor for the Agency at one time. A search of
OSDO indices in name of SUBJECT met with negative results, however
SANCA indices reflect SFN 54621 in name of Adrian F. Sherman.
A perusal of SUBJECT file reveals that Adrian Sherman was affiliated
with DCD as a covert contract employee, but is presently retired.
SSD to be apprised at a later hour. ADS
