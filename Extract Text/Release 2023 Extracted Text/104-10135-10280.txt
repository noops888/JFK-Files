MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
9 August 1978
On this date I spoke with HSCA staffer Surrel Brady re her
trip to (Paris) to interview Thomas B. Casasin. I informed Ms. Brady
that Casasin will be free to see her at the American Embassy at 10 a.m.
on 17 August 1978; Room number and any other arrangements for the
meeting would be given to her in (Paris) as the Station contact point.
Ms. Brady asked if the meeting could be moved up one day to 16 August.
Since her departure date/time from Washington is scheduled for
tomorrow, I opined that it would be difficult to change the
plans and notify her prior to her departure. I suggested that
she contact (Mr. Jeton) and seek to make adjustments once she is
actually in (Paris). Ms. Brady agreed to follow my suggestion.
