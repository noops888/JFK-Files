HEARD MUCH TALK OF MANUSCRIPT FROM CURTIS. FOR EXAMPLE,
BURNELL GOODRICH CLAIMS TO HAVE READ ONE CHAPTER. SHE THINKS
5 이
DEMPSTER MAY HAVE HELPED WITH SMORANGE PARTS. THIS
3
DISCUSSION OF MANUSCRIPT BY CURTIS, ALTHOUGH NOT CLEAR WHO ALL
MAY HAVE READ IT, MEANS IT IS WELL KNOWN AND, ACCORDING TO
HER, LOOKED FOR WITH SOME ANTICIPATION BY FRIENDS IN HIS U.S.
CIRCLE HERE.) ASHMEAD ADVISED HER AGAINST READING MANUSCRIPT,
AS IT DISCUSSES IN OPEN WAY INTIMATE MATTERS OF PREVIOUS

:
MARRIAGE. IMPORTANTLY, ASHMEAD POINTED OUT, INFORMATION
THEREIN WOULD VIOLATE TWO DIFFERENT SECRECY AGREEMENTS (U.K.J
AND U.S.) AS WELL AS DOING GREAT DAMAGE TO OUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTS. THE INFORMATION IS, AS IT WERE,
U.S. GOVERNMENT PROPERTY AND ASHMEAD SAID THAT THE PUBLICATION
WOULD DISMAY CURTIS FRIENDS AND HARM HIS REPUTATION AND
3
2
MEMORY. SHE SEEMED APPALLED AT IDEA OF PUBLISHING MANUSCRIPT,
SAYING THAT SHE REALIZED WHEN CURTIS TOLD HER OF VISIT TO
3
2
DIRECTOR THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG. SHE ALSO ASKED ASHMEAD
ABOUT CURTIS' MOTIVATION IN THIS. IN DISCUSSION OF THESE AND
3
4
OTHER PAPERS SHE AGREED (ALTHOUGH IT THEN SEEMED TO KINGMAN

SOMEWHAT HESITANT) TO COOPERATE WITH KINGMAN ON GETTING AGENCY

GOM MAR AUTHORITY AND PRESUMABLY THIS WILL CONTINUE WHEN
BARRON RETURNS MEXICO PROBABLY 7 MAY.) MORE IMPORTANT

REASON KEEP IN TOUCH WITH BENADUM IS TO HAVE HIS HELP OR,

SHE MENTIONED, CURTIS REFERRED TO INSURANCE AND SURVIVOR
ANNUITIES IN HIS WILL AS PART OF ESTATE. SHE OBVIOUSLY NOT

KINGMAN POINTED OUT THAT ASHMEAD WANTED AGENCY LAWYER TO BE
HELPFUL IN PROTECTING HER INTERESTS AS POSSIBLE BUT MIGHT BE
LIMITED AS MIGHT BE INEXPERT IN MEXICAN LAW. HAUF YOU
CONSIDERED OUR GETTING A CORRESPONDENT HERE TO ADVISE OUR
LAWYER ON MEXICAN LAW OR DO YOU CONSIDER THAT ADVISABLE?

KEEP IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH HER TO BE HELPFUL AND TO BE NEAR
