MEMORANDUM FOR: Director
Federal Bureau of Investigation
SUBJECT: Grigori Ye. GOLUB
11
1. An official Finnish source stated that approximately in December
1957, a member of the Finnish security service had luncheon with Subject,
who has identified himself as Second Secretary and Chief of the Consular
Section of the Soviet Embassy in Helsinki. At this meeting, Subject asked
the Finn what the latter thought of the Colonel ABKL-Feino BAYHAREN case
and whether the Finn had been able to ascertain if BAYHAREN had ever been
in Finland. The Finn stated only that he had been following the press
reports with interest and added that his organization had not been able to
find any indication that BAYHAREN had been in Finland as claimed in the
press. Upon hearing this answer, Subject consented that the entire case was
clearly a provocative fabrication on the part of the Americans.
2. Subject arrived in Finland sometime around the end of 1955 and
later replaced I. Y. SUNIKATE, a known Soviet State Security officer.
Subject also is suspected of being a Soviet State Security officer. On
22 September 1957, Subject went to Moscow, returning to Helsinki from there on
6 November 1957.
3. This is the second instance known to us in which a Soviet official
has tried to explain away the All case as an American provocation.
4. The above is for your information only and should not be passed to
other agencies.
