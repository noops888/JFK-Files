Costa Rican's Call for Talks
With Castro Shocks Exiles
By JEREMIAH O'LEARY
Star News Stall Writer
Costa Rica's President Jose
Figueres has thrown the West.
ern Hemisphere's half-million
Cubac exiles into a state of
shock by his declaration that
they should seek a dialogue
with Fidel Castro.
It happened at an exile ban
quet in San Juan, Puerto Rico,
last week attended by many
anti-Castro leaders and by the
leading officials of the island
commonwealth, including Luis
i Munoz Marin and the new gov.
ernor, Rafael Hernandez Co...
loa.
Figueres had seemed to be
an ideal choice as the speaker
to the exile leaders because
no Latin American leader has
been a more open and vigor.
ous enemy of Castro. The oc-
casion was the 120th birthday
celebration of Jose Marti,
Cuba's national hero and a
man idealized by both the ex-
iles and by Castro supporters.
For most of his speech, the
eloquent and democratic-
minded Figueres gave a stel-
lar performance, combining
fine oratory with wit. But
then, toward the end of his
speech, "Don Pepe" Figueres
dropped his bombshell.
Seek a Dialogue
He said the Cuban exiles
should seek a dialogue with
Castro because there is no
prospect of overthrowing him.
And he offered himself as an
intermediary.
"If I have to share with you
actions which are not pleasur
able but bitter, and mediate
with Frel, Russia or the devil,
I am at your disposal," Fi-
gueres said to the stunned au-
Interpretation
dience. Such exile leaders as
Jose Mara Cardona and Manuel
Ray who once were active in
mitant attempts to overthrow
the Communist regime set up
by Castro, were described as
barely able to restrain them-
selves,
The surprise declaration by
Figueres was greeted with al-
most total silence, although a
few women reportedly cried at
his words.
Figueres appeared to have
second thoughts about what he
had said later in the week
when he arrived in Panama.
Reporters asked him about
reports tr... he had offered
to be a mediator among the
Cubans and Figueres replied
evasively that he had said
nothing specific.
"I am always at the disposal
of the Cubans for whatever
they please," he told Pana-
manian newsmen.
Close to Exiles
Asked if it was true that the
militant exile organization
Alpha 65 had rejected hus of-
fer, Figueres said he was not
famihar with the organiza-
tion.
Weil-informed sources on
Caribbean and Central Ameri-
can affairs say Figueres
knows as much as any man
about the Cuban exile move-
ments and the men who lead
them. After the Bay of Pigs
disaster, some of the survivors
of the invading force went to
Costa Rica. Figueres himself,
in his youth, was a leader of
guerrilla forces fighting
against such dictators as Ra-
WASH STAR NEWS, 9 Feb 1973
:
fael Trujillo and Anastasio So-
moza Garcia.
But Figueres also is known
as a reausticman When Cos
ta Rica found itself with a
huge coffee surplus, Figueres
established diplomatic rela-
tions with Russia and sold his
entire surplus to the Soviet
Union.
His Miarti dinner speech
seems to mean that he has
decided that, realistically,
Castroism is here to stay and
will have to be accepted. Only
Figueres, however, would
have chosen a Cuban exile
conclave to state his new
stand.
