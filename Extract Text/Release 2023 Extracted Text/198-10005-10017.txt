OPERATIONAL
1. An internal leader of the Movimiento Recuperacion Revolu-
cionario (MRR) who was infiltrated into Cuba on 29 December 1961, and
exfiltrated on 29 March 1962, said at a debriefing on 7 April that he

2. A unilaterally recruited senior officer of the diplomatic
service of a neutralist African country has been briefed and given
training in secret writing and communications to assist him in reporting
on our objectives in Cuba., He is now in Havana from where he plans
to travel to areas of interest to us.
The Chief of the
Intelligence Service has agreed to
cooporate with us on Cuban intelligence operations. He has identified
several sources aboard ships transitting Cuban ports and has arranged
for their periodic briefing and debriefing.

for dissemination. The most interesting and Informative refugee thus
far is the brother of Amando Hart, the Cuban Minister of Education and
member of the twenty-five man ORI Central Committee. The center is
also collecting travel and personal documents which may be used for
agent operatione.
6. We received valuable data on Cuban trade from the debriefing
of a former official of the Ministry of Commerce who defected in Canada
wane informed in
the end of March We had beening February by CIA sources
that this official was disaffected and wished to work against Castro. We
contacted him and attempted unsuccessfully to induce him to return to
Cuba as our agent. We have since expedited his travel to Miami where
he is being interrogated.
7. We are in contact with Eva Matos, the sister of Huber Matos,
former associate of Fidel Castro, who broke with Fidel and has been
in jail on the Isle of Pines since 1960. Although there is no practical
method of effecting the escape or release of Huber at present, we will
continue contact with his sister, who maintains correspondence with
Huber through his father and his wife who are in Cuba.

into 'blocks" infiltrated by communist informants under the direction of
also
block chiefs of the Comite de Defensa." The informant system
utilizes
hampion data procured from the telephone monitoring switchboards
established in the telephone centrals of every town. One refugee from
the Cuban Telephone Company described a switchboard panel in the
''Principe plant" in Havana which was monitoring "20 or 30 positions."
These informants, their chiefs, members of the militia, G-2, "chivatos"
(provocation agents), and other Castro supporters are now generally
labeled by the populace as communists rather than Castroists.
9. While the network of informants protects the home front,
officials of the National Directorate of the Integrated Revolutionary
Organization (ORI) are increasingly occupied with the export of Castroist-
communism to the Western Hemisphere. Flight manifests of Cubana
Airlines show that 'hundreds of Latin Americans are being brought to

Cuba for training and indoctrination." In addition to regular commercial
transportation, charter flights to service these persons are being run
thrice monthly throughout South America. In order to avoid Cuban visas
and entry-exit stamps in their passports, these persons are given visas
on a separate sheet of paper. In Cuba all arrangements are made for
them by the Instituto Cubano de Amistad con los Pueblos (ICAP).
10. Soviet. military equipment has been reported in increasingly
larger quantities and wider disbursement. One refugee said that he
saw 20 or 25 wheel-mounted Soviet 100 mm field guns M-55 (identified
from photographs) at a militia camp at Miranda near Camaguey.
. Shortages of certain essential food items have resulted in
widespread protests and, in a few instances, to open action by those
directly affected. A group of '13 to 15 women" reportedly waylaid a
milk truck, overpowered the driver, and each carried off two liters
of milk.
12. Refugees described the existence of three resistance organiza
tions, allegedly widespread in membership but limited in action. One,

group which has broken away from the Movimiento de Recuperacion

now begun to develop a following. The second organisation, the Movi-
miento Democratico Cristiano (MDC), is described as oriented along
traditional Christian democratic lines. It is said to have a national
coordinator, a national executive, provincial, military and political
coordinators, and resistance chiefs." They claim that military and
counter-revolutionary activities have been limited because of lack of
equipment. A third organization, the Unidad Revolucionario (UR),
is reported to be carrying out the sabotage of sugar fields by burning,
using a small incendiary device made of gelatin, match heads, potassium
permanganate tablets, and glycerine.
