The Privacy Act, Public Law 93-579, requires that Federal agencies inform
individuals when they are asked to provide their Social Security Account
Number (SSN) whether the disclosure is mandatory or voluntary, by what authority
such number is solicited and what uses will be made of the SSN. Disclosure by
you of your SSN is voluntary. The authority for this solicitation is Executive
Order 9397. The SSN is used as an identifier in requests for access certification.
Failure to provide your SSN may delay the processing required to obtain a
security access certification.
