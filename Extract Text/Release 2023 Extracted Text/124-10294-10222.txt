SUBSEQUENTLY REASSIGNED TO ANOT HER POST FOR HIS OWN SAFETY,
CIA, CARACAS, CANNOT STATE DEFINITELY THAT THE SHOT WAS FIRED
BY MORALES OR SOMEONE ACTING FOR HIM, BUT THIS IS NOT BEYOND THE
REALM OF POSSIBILITY.
(U) CIA, CARACAS, SELIEVES THAT THE ONLY PURPOSE THE ASSASSINATION
(U)
OF THERIAULT WOULD HAVE SERVED WOULD HAVE BEEN TO STRAIN RELATIONS
BETWEEN VENEZUELA AND THE UNITED STATES, AND MOST CERTAINLY WOULD
NOT HAVE AIDED THE ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA CAUSE IN ANY WAY.
A CIA SOURCE HAS ADVISED THAT AT A RECENT PARTY AT THE
RESIDENCE OF ORLANDO GARCIA, MORALES, WHILE QUITE INTOXICATED
ASKED IF SEEING THE CUBAN FLAG AND HEARING THE CUBAN NAT IO NAL
ANTHEM DID NOT EMOTIONALLY AFFECT SOURCE. SOURCE ANSWERED IN THE
AFFIRMATIVE, AND MORALES THEN STATED TO THE EFFECT THAT HE "COULD
LIVE WITH BRESHNEV," REFERRING TO THE SOVIET PREMIER. MORALES IS
NOT RPT NOT CURRENTLY ON THE ROLLS OF OFFICIAL DISIP EMPLOYEES,
HAS VACATED HIS APARTMENT AT THE ANAUCO HILTON, LEAVING AN UNPAID
BILL OF BS. 16,000, WHICH WAS PAID BY ORLANDO GARCIA, AND HAS
TAKEN UP RESIDENCE IN AN APARTMENT, THE COST OF WHICH IS PROHIBITIVE
ON ONLY, THE SALARY PAID BY DISIP. THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT
END PAGE TWO
PAGE THREE CAR 97-2 SEC
MORALES CONTINUES TO BE PAID BY DISIP, POSSIBLY AS A CONTRACT EM
PLOYEE, BUT HIS STANDARD OF LIVING CERTAINLY INDICATES ANOT HER
SUBSTANTIAL SOURCE OF INCOME, IF HE IS, IN FACT, PAYING HIS CURRENT
BILLS.
CIA, CARACAS, BELIEVES THAT IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, AND THE
VITUPEROUS ATTACKS MORALES HAS MADE AGAINST THE CIA AND THE FBI,
THE POSSIBILITY CERTAINLY EXISTS THAT HE IS MENTALLY UNSTABLE, AND
MAY VERY LIKELY BE A CASTRO DOUBLE AGENT.
LEGAT FEELS VERY STRONGLY THAT ANY CONTACT WITH MORALES BE
VERY CIRCUMSPECT, AND ANY INFORMATION FURNISHED BY HIM OR ATTRIBUTED
TO HIM, BE CAREFULLY ANALYZED BEFORE BEING ACCEPTED AS FACT.

ADMINISTRATIVE: FOR THE INFORMATION OF THE BUREAU, ORLANDO
GARCIA IS CURRENTLY CONFINED TO BED AT HIS RESIDENCE DUE TO VER Y
SERIOUS LIVER PROBLEMS. HE HAS BEEN ADVISED BY HIS DOCTOR THAT IF
HE DOES NOT STOP DRINKING IT WILL KILL HIM IN SHORT ORDER.
GARCIA IS MORALES PROTECTOR IN DISIP, AND SHOULD HE EXPIRE
OR BECOME INCAPACITATED, MORALES WOULD MOST CERTAINLY LOSE HIS
INFLUENCE WITH GENERAL GIMENEZ GAINZA AND BE COMPLETELY SEPARAT ED
