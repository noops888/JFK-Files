Dear John,
As I mentioned over the telephone, we have uncovered one
more document requiring CIA review which I am enclosing.
Hopefully this will be the last one.
I am also returning to you CIA's referral under the Act to
HDR of August 23, which John Glennon has reviewed. As you can
see by his note, he completed it several days ago, and I forgot
to pass it on to you when you were over the other day. John
Glennon has indicated one document for postponement. Although
I am returning it to you with the rest at this point, I have
passed a copy of it on to the reviewers in Diplomatic Security,
who are coordinating a response with CA. I will call you when
I get an answer from them. If they decide to release it, we
would then have to obtain a concurrence from FBI..
Thank you again for your prompt action in reviewing our
request. I will be getting back to you on the DS answer after
I return on October 7.

Dear Nina:
Thank you for the background on "Roger Channel" from
your FAM. We will discontinue deleting this designator
except where the specific use of it might compromise
something else we need to protect.
I am returning to you herewith the two documents from
the Department of State collection of President John F.
Kennedy assassination records that you sent me on 8
November. We have identified those passages we want to
continue to protect with yellow highlighting and paper
clips. In the State cable from Mexico City of 28 November
1963, we are asking for the deletion of "Roger Channel," in
this case because DO chooses to protect the fact that
Ambassador Mann used this channel to keep readers of this
formerly very sensitive cable to a minimum. We concur with
your other three deletions and your reasoning for them
(though the third of these is clearly State's to call).

two deletions to protect our presence in Brussels at that)

I am returning to you herewith the documents from the

assassination records which I had begun to review in your
office on 27 September. Of the 77 documents in your two
accompanying lists, we have released in full--or indicated

deletions of still sensitive CIA information (really
minimal) in 25.5. This leaves two in your list (both on
page three) which are technically missing from the package,

Dear Nina,
20520
This is a response to your letters of 30 September and 27 October
1993 and 31 January and 25 February 1994, enclosing material for CIA
review under the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of
1992. This collection comprises seven documents (plus four duplicates),
with a total of 40 pages. In all but two of the documents, CIA is
asking for postponements of some passages under the terms of §§ (1)(A),
(1) (B), (1)(C), and (4) of Section 6 of the Act. These passages are
marked in yellow highlighting. For those passages marked off by red or
black ink brackets, but without yellow highlighting, CIA has determined
that said passages may be released under the terms of the Act.
I apologize personally for the inordinate delay in getting these
documents back to you.

We are returning herewith the documents from the Bureau of
Diplomatic Security of the Department which we were asked to review for
coordination last year. Mr. Henry Cohen, DS/POC/FOIA, hand-carried this
package to us; I understand Mr. Cohen has since retired from the
Department.
We count 90 documents (252 pages) in this package. The Historical
Review Group of CIA has determined that 47 of these documents may be
released in full, as far as CIA equities are concerned. We are asking
for postponements of some passages in the remaining 43 documents under
the terms of §§ (1) (A), (1)(B), (1)(C), and (3) of Section 6 of the JFK
Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. These passages are marked

Compliance with the JFK Records Collection Act
Our records indicate that on 8/26/93, we referred one document to
you for review under the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act
of 1992 (copy of referral memo attached). Although all other CIA
referrals have been returned to us, we are unable to locate your
response on this document. We assume that since it was sent to you
separately, it may have been misrouted either in our office or
yours.
Therefore, we are sending you another copy of Department of State
record number 1191000310151 and ask that you review your
information outlined in red. If a determination is made that
information should be withheld, please provide justification of
postponement of its release based on the provisions of Section 6 of
the Act. Once you have completed your review, please return the
information to: Kathleen Siljegovic, DS/PPB/PAD 5th Floor, Bureau
of Diplomatic Security, 2121 Virginia Avenue, N.W., Washington,
D.C. 20522-1003. If we can be of any assistance, please contact
Alice Ritchie at (202)663-0333.
