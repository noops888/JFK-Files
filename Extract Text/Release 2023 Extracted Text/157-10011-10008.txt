OCCURRENCE: In a Presidential meeting on Vietnam with the CIA participants
being McCone and Colby the record by Colby reflects that McNamarra pointed out that
Lodge has little contact with Diem and has not been out of Saigon. Mr. McCone commented
that he believed that we should move cautiusly, that we should talk seriously to Diem
_and_that Lodge should be urged to visit the countryside to obtain a more realistic
view of the effects of suspending aid. Mr. McCone also suggested that another approach
be made to Nhu to seek his cooperation ina departure. The President asked whether we
had carefully studied the detail effects of cuts in aid. (as proposed in a paper prepared
by Hillsman). It was evident that the effects had not been studies. The President
asked DOD and CIA to analyze the Hillsman paper. He also asked that a telegram be sent
to Lodge asking him to try to reduce the press leakage from Saigon and to establish some
real contact with Diem. Any current plans for aid negotiation should be stalled, and the
PresidesOURCEould be well informed of any steps taken in this contexSTAFFSuch as thes
instance involving CIA payment to Col Tung last week.

OCCURRENCE:
In a Presidential meeting on Vietnam on October 29, 1963 with MCCONE, HELMS, AND COLBY
in attendance. The following record by HELMS and COLBY shows that: it was suggested
that in the Ambassador's absence, HARKINS, TRUEHART, and DAVID SMITH act as a
committee to direct a coup operation. MCCONE countered with the view that SMITH should
not be involved in such a-policy-making function, although he would be in a position-to-
provide technical advise to HARKINS and TRUEHART as well as carry out their instructions
in the operations field. The President stated that if the forces in Saigon were not
clearly in favor of the coup we should discourage its launching. The Attorney General
felt the U.S. was risking too much based on flimsy ev idence. The DCI stated his view
that even a successful coup would create a period of interregmum, confusion which might
only be solved by a second or third coup.
