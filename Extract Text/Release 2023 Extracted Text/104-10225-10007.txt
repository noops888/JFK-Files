MEMORANDUM FOR:
Earl J. Williamson
SUBJECT: Foreign Divorce Decree
1. The purpose of this memorandum is to bring certain information
to your attention which relates to the fact that your current spouse was a
party to the dissolution in Mexico of a former marriage.
2. Recently, the Office of General Counsel completed a study of the
validity of a Mexican divorce decree and potential problems arising from
such a divorce for JKLANCE employees concerned and JKLANCE. A
summary of OGC's study is attached.
3. You will note from the attachment that the employee whose current
marriage follows a Mexican divorce may be confronted with serious
problems affecting eligibility for payment of various government benefits
such as reimbursement of hospitalization expenses, survivorship benefits
and certain types of overseas allowances. My purpose in writing to you,
therefore, is to be sure you are made aware of and understand the seriousness
of the problems which would arise in the event of a challenge to the
validity of the Mexican divorce and, consequently, to the validity of the
current marriage. This challenge could arise at any time and from a
number of sources.
4. JKLANCE has another interest stemming from Mexican divorces
and this is one of security, depending upon the employee's specific employment.
In the event such a divorce is challenged, subsequent litigation and
attendant publicity become quite probable. It is, of course, in JKLANCE's
best interest that this sort of activity be avoided where possible.
5. Recognizing that there are various types of Mexican divorce, and
also that the various states in the United States have decided cases in different
ways depending on the type of Mexican divorce involved and its own case law,
you may wish to discuss your personal situation with your attorney or a rep-
resentative of JKLANCE's Office of General Counsel. In the meantime,
however, JKLANCE's position with respect to your situation is that it assumes
the validity of your current marriage, unless the earlier Mexican divorce
action and your current marriage are challenged. Should that challenge ever
occur, it may be necessary for JKLANCE to determine that your eligibility
for benefits based on your current marriage must be suspended until such
time as the challenge is litigated or otherwise resolved. Special note should
be taken of the fact that such a challenge might arise after your death, possibly
resulting in the distribution of insurance proceeds and other death benefits to
other than your immediate family as constituted at your death and contrary to
your own intentions and wishes.
6. Please advise me of your plans and any actions taken in connection
with the above. If you have any questions on the substance of this memorandum
or its purpose, please do not hesitate to let me know.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Home Leave - Earl J. Williamson
1. The following are the circumstances concerning my
departure and home leave from San Jose, Costa Rica.

b. In October 1970 home leave and return orders

March and was fully occupied until 5 April in locating

Dear Earl:
You have just completed, at my direction, seven weeks
of full-time service on the GS-13 Clandestine Service
Personnel Evaluation Board. I know that this work has been
particularly demanding. Your participation and diligent
application of your professional experience have been
decisive factors in the successful accomplishment of the
Board's missions.
In the course of this assignment you have become
thoroughly familiar with the use and interpretation of per-
sonnel files and personnel practices of the Clandestine
Service. Having reviewed and analyzed the files of one
hundred or more CS officers, you have had to make judgments
and recommendations concerning their relative-ranking and
their qualifications for promotion, for training required
to overcome a deficiency or enhance career effectiveness,
for changes of assignment to further career development and
for Quality Step Increases to recognize outstanding perform-
ance. In so doing, you have carefully studied the career
development of a large number of officers in all components
of the CS, both as individuals and in relationship to each
other in terms of merit and value to the Clandestine Service.
You have become familiar with a broad spectrum of
personnel and administrative problems on a practical working
level and have acquired a knowledge of personnel management
which will better equip you to handle supervisory positions
which require personnel reporting and career development of
subordinates. The committee format of the panels has also
deepened your understanding of the conference approach to
management problems.
Mr. Earl Williamson

I wish to commend you personally for your participation

Clandestine Service Career Service. A copy of this letter
will be included in your official personnel file so that
your supervisors and future Evaluation Boards may make due
note of this service.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Personnel Management Committee
SUBJECT: Request of Mr. Earl J. Williamson, GS-15,
to Remain in Staff Status Following
Marriage to an Alien
1. Attached is a request from Mr. Earl J. Williamson
for permission to continue in a staff status with the Agency
following marriage to a Cuban citizen. WE Division strongly
recommends favorable consideration.
2. Mr. Williamson is a fifty year old officer who
entered on duty with the Agency in 1952. He has been assigned
to the Madrid Station since October 1960 where he has served
as the Deputy Chief of Station and since May 1964 as the
Western European Coordinator for Cuban Activities. Since his
assignment to the Madrid Station, Mr. Williamson's performance
has been outstanding. He is a mature, experienced, and well-
rounded officer who is particularly well-suited for Agency
employment. In every sense of the word, Mr. Williamson is a
dedicated officer who has spared no effort to expand and
improve the Agency's coverage in his area of assignment.
3. WE Division concurs with the Chief of Station, Madrid,
who has stated that he does not believe that Mr. Williamson's
marriage will adversely affect in any way his future usefulness
or mobility of assignment in the Agency. Mr. Williamson plans
to proceed with the marriage in October 1965 shortly prior to
his return for reassignment to WH Division. Informal dis-
cussion with WH Division has indicated that they foresee no
difficulty with their plans for Mr. Williamson were he to
marry this alien as planned. Mr. Williamson is
in
the
and will be required to submit a
similar request after Agency decision is received if he retains
his
in his next assignment.
SECRET
4. WE Division strongly believes that on the basis of
his past performance and proven capability, Mr. Williamson is
therefore, recommend that you favorably endorse his request
and forward it to the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence
for consideration.

DISPATCH
Chief, WE
Application to Marry an Alien
A. application for permission to marry an alien is
transmitted to Headquarters with my strong recommendation that it be promptly
approved and he be so notified. It has been my privilege to have known
Williamson's fiancée for over three years. She is a most attractive young
lady and is a member of a distinguished and respected Cuban family. She is
well-educated, fluent (bi-lingual) in English, intelligent, cultured and
gracious. I have found her at all times to be discreet. There is no question
whatsoever in my mind that she will be a most loyal American citizen and a
credit to her new country and to the Agency in every way. In future assignments
abroad she will, without question, be an aid to
in the development
of contacts and in carrying out their joint representational responsibilities.
She is indeed a very fine person. I have no reservations whatsoever, mental
or otherwise with respect to the security aspects of this marriage - as
far as I have been able to ascertain, none exist. I do not feel that
marriage to this young lady should in any way restrict his future
assignments.
I urge speedy and favorable processing of this application.
