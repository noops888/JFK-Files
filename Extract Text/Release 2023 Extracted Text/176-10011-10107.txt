SPECIAL HANDLING
When possible they will be recruited and
trained while visiting outside Cuba; however,
when necessary recruitment and training will
be done inside Cuba either by established
agents or by agents infiltrated especially for
the task. Whether this is done unilaterally
or jointly with a third country intelligence
organization is determined on a case by
case basis.
In some cases the travel as generated
specifically by CIA; in other cases the
travels can be utilized to meet intelligence
requirements.

SPECIAL HANDLING
PURPOSE
In addition to meeting the above
cited intelligence objectives,
operational intelligence, and re-
cruitment leads as well as agent
material result from the Opa-locka
and Madrid operations. In addition
to meeting basic intelligence re-
quirements above, timely opera -
tional intelligence is vital to CIA
current operations.
35. Spot, recruit, and train third
country nationals resident in Cuba.
(CIA, supported by State and Defense).
See 34 above.
36. Spot, recruit and train legal travellers
who have potential access to significant
information. (CIA, supported by State
and Defense).

SPECIAL HANDLING
CONSIDERATIONS
The continuation of the refugee flow and
the selective debriefing of refugees provide
the most significant source of intelligence.
Follow up debriefing of selected refugees
after departure from Opa-locak will
continue:
ACTIVITY
CONSIDERATIONS
38. Continue joint Spanish IS/CIA interro -
gation center, Madrid. (CIA)
See 34 above.
Due to local conditions and problems, the
Madrid Debriefing Center will continue to
be more limited in size and selective in
choice of refugees than Opa-locka. This
is primarily an NSA problem but CIA will
continue to assist as practicable.
39. Maintain PAA service between the U.S.
and Cuba. (State, with CIA support).
To provide intelligence and agent
personnel and documentation, as
well as to continue the exodus of
skilled manpower from Cuba.
PAA requires financial assistance to con-
tinue this activity.
40. Continue and expand, as practical,
communications intelligence coverage
of Cuban communications nets.
(Defense and CIA).
See 34 above.
It is recognized that significant increase in
coverage of the internal micro-wave system
would become a major budget and personnel
problem.
41. Continue monitoring overt Cuban
broadcasts. (CIA).
To obtain intelligence and propa-
ganda material.
This is done on a regular basis by FBIS.
42. Urge, assist, and/or support friendly
third country intelligence services to
expand their intelligence coverage of
Cuban intelligence requirements. (CIA).
See 34 above.
This will be handled through existing
liaison channels.

43. Expand, as practical, audio coverage
of potentially profitable Cuban intelli-
gence targets. (CIA)

others it is done jointly with the host intelli -
gence service.
44. Establish program of periodic reports
from U.S. Embassies in Hemisphere
analyzing the effects of existence of
the target area regime on host country.
(State):
To maintain a reasonably current
estimate of the impact of the target
area regime on the Hemisphere.
