about the Matahambre sabotage operation since 4-5 Oct and asked Bruce Chever (in
Bill Harvey's absence) specifically for information about all CIA action teams inside
Cuba on 30 Oct and again on 31 Oct so that I could give a firm report to Dept. Sect.
Gilpatric prior to negotiations with the Soviets. Chever had not mentioned the
Matahambre sabotage team when I asked about action teams inside. Chever did mention
-that-two-action-teams-were-inside (one-small-one-in-Central-Cuba, and one_with_about
200 men in Western Cuba), that these teams were under orders not to take actions, but
to collect intelligence.

ground memorandum requested by Rosewell Gilpatric, information was requested
from CIA on the current status of all operations. CIA reported all militant
operations have been ordered held at a stop, although the volatile Cubans
were frustrated and not under complete control. The Matahambre operation
was not mentioned by the CIA in reporting in operational teams inside Cuba,
although I asked for specifics on militant-teams inside. Two-action-teams
CIA reported as being inside Cuba were described as in place only collecting
intelligence, not actions, (sabotage,etc.)*

deterred by the order (to stop hit and run raids). They may even profit by
the decree. It will now be a greater honor to engage in operations against
Fidel. The double jeopardy arising from the threat of detention by U.S. agents
and the chance for martyrdom at the hands of Fidel will be an even greater
challlenge. Actually the supply of recruits for such hit and run raids may
run shallow but not dry."

Fitzgerald states it is too soon actually to state definitely
what the effect of this policy (i.e. stopping raids) will have on our recruit-
ment program. The Agency's problem is not the number of recruits, but their
quality. The unemployed, poorly educated, hungry are always with us.
the more discerning Cuban types will avoid recruitment as they are convinced
that a priciple reason for the U.S. action is to control who fights Castro in
order to insure who will succeed him.

of U.S. agents will be the improvement and control and better clandestine
security practices on the part of the exiles. But as the U.S. restricts and
apprehends these men, confiscating goods and funds, the loci power will have
a tendency to move back to its traditional center: the exile--monied interests
such as the bosches, prlos and Batistas.
