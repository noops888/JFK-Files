SUBJECT: GENERAL O John Augustus McVICKAR, Jre 201-33608
1. Subject is presently employed in Paris
He is well known to
Douglas C. HARE and Eleanor T. HARTWELL, the former having known him
socially for a number of years and the latter having dealt with nim on
transportation problems since his appointment, fifteen months ago, to the
position he now occupies
2. Subject is also a long-time friend of UMOVED, who brought him
to our attention as a potential recruit and who has provided us with the
biographical information contained in the attached personal record form
No. 51-67.
3. From what I have been able to gather from UNMOVED, as well as
from HARP and HARTHELL, subject appears to be the type of individual which
might be ideally suited to fulfill certain valuable operational assignments
in France, such as "spotter" for other high-level potential agents, high-
level contacts, cut-out, etc. All who know him agree that subject is capable
of doing anything and getting to know anyone" if he so chooses. Apparently
subject, despite the "brass which surrounds his perceptible personality, is
a serious-minded, intelligent and patriotic individual who has had much ex-
perience along lines which could be of use to this organization, as well as
an uncanny knack of being able to introduce and ingratiate himself into prac-
tically any milieu of interest to his work or wishes. A partial list of
subject's fairly close friends, as reported by UN OVED on Page 8-a of attach-
pent, shows the variety of people subject knows and sees whenever they are
in this area. Undoubtedly, subject himself could add a much longer list of
names to those reported herein, particularly with respect to contacts in
Europe.
4. I am assured by UMOVED that subject, despite despite his ability to
ake and keep murerous and varied friendships, is far from being a "good
tine Charlie". He is, on the other hand, che of those characters whow every-
one likes and trusts and who goes out of their way to see as often as occa-
cion permits. UIDED assures re that subjecicularly good friend

and in the cover-jot he now occupies could be explofte 3 could be explofted to advantage by
this Station and the organization as a whole. Silbject has abso absolute free-
dom of movement outside France (usually by TWA), entree into practically
any milieu his assignments might require and is known to be an intelli-
gent, hard-working and patriotic individual
6. On a recent tour of inspection of
circuit,
assured subject he would endeavor
to secure for his an additional allotment of funds to supplement his
present expense account budget. Due to budgetary restrictions this has
not been possible and subject is at present seeking another, more remuner-
`ative position, since he claims that his present income of approximately
$666.00 monthly (including expense account) is insufficient to permit him
to live in Paris and maintain the contacts and activity required by his
job. According to UNMOVED, subject is at present endeavoring to secure
from his good friend
sales agency
the
Meanwhile, however, subject is
not contemplating resigning his position
until he has a firm and
more remunerative position. UNMCVED states that subject plans to remain
at least until the end of the year, by which time he may have
secured something better. Subject has also had talks with
(on his recent trip to France) concerning the possibility of handling the
agency here. Nothing has come of this possibility to date, but
subject appears to be hopeful.
7. UNMOVED is of the opinion that subject would be most receptive
to a proposition of doing intelligence work and furthermore believes that
if subject could supplement his present income by an additional $200 or
$300 per month, he would be willing to remain with THA, which he likes
and is only considering leaving due to his present low total income, much
of which is spent in connection with activities required by his position.
8. UICOVED hás, of course, ever even hinted to subject anything
about his ca undercover activities and is sure subject does not suspect
that the former is doing anything but his cover work in France. UNMOVED,
when questioned as to his opinion concerning subject's potential value
as a covert agent, as well as his recuitability, has pointed out very
strongly that subject, due to the very nature of his personality, must
be given a good deal of operational guidance and be closely controlled.
Questioned as to whether some other individual should endeavor to recruit
subject, UNMOVED, was of the opinion that, should the organization desire
to do so, he would be best fitted to exploit subject's potential, sime

he has known hin for a good many years and as a close friend, knows his
strong and weak points and could, in gelerat, inataile subject to better
advantage than another individual who might have only occasional contact
with him,
9. Te request that consideration de given to the advisability of
endeavoring to recruit subject and, in the event of a favorable decision,
that provisional operational clearance be given in order that subject may
be approached on the subject of engaging in intelligence work. With
regard to whom should actually recruit subject, we suggest that HARE might
safely make the first approach and, if subject accepts and firal security
is obtained, he might eventually be turned over to UEMOVED for exploita-
tion.
10. We would appreciate your reactions to the desirability of
recruiting subject, as well as your thoughts as to how best exploit his
obvious potential.

11. If subject's recruitability is approved in principle and he
is given provisional security clearance, this Station would then prepare
a field project outline, to be submitted to you for approval.

Interest to you as a potential candidate for recruitment, thus bringing to
a head a question which normally would have followed its course through the
mill. In this case, however, due to Subject's alleged resignation
we felt that a cable such as the one we dispatched was justified, dhe to the
fact that unless some quick action is taken, Subject will definitely leave his

and seek employment elsewhere.
2. Cn 10 December, Subject had luncheon with EIRF and unloaded all his
financial troubles. In a casual way HARE asked him if by any chance he would
be willing to stay on
if his salary were supplemented. Subject took
esgerly to this possibility, since it is well-known that Subject likes his
job and desireş very much to remmin, but is resigning merely for financial
reasons. In consultation with UN'OVED and MARE, both of whom know Subject
well, it is arnament that probably $300 monthly would allow Subject to decide
to stay
provided we are sufficiently interested in recruiting him
for intelligence activities.

ter, and prepared prior to IARE's luncheon with Subject. There seems to be

HEVICHAR is worth recruiting. it is too early, not having had specific and
detailed talks with DeVICKAR, to submit a project outline, but all here are

& December, 1949
Subject is quitting his position
as of 31 December, 1949. In August, 1949, subject advised his superiors, including
and a personal friend, that he could
not continue unless a larger salary and a more liberal expense account were forth-
coming. He was informed in due course by Vice President
that it was impossible
for the company to give him more money within the present wage structura. Subject
therefor decided to seek other employment. On or about 15 November subject was
advised by Overseas Manager
that he could proceed to make new arrangements
as of the end of the year. Whether eject actually resigned or was asked to
terminate his connection due to his repeated Gamands for more money is not completely

1. UNMOVED has just informed me that Subject has definitely decided
not to return to Paris and is now staying at the Hotel Stanhope on 5th Ave.,
New York. UNMOVED further assures me that Subject is definitely un employed
for the moment and is desperately looking for suitable employment.
2. Apparently Subject has been able to borrow a considerable amount
of money, he having sent to his wife who remained behind in Paris a suffi-
cient amount of dollars to cover local debts in French Francs which Subject
had accrued at the various Faris hotels, bars, nightclubs, etc. Subject's
wife is at present liquidating all thone cetts, closing up and returning to
the owner the apartment in which they lived and plans to depart for New York
to rejoin her husband within a few days.
3. UNMOVED ; also assured me that Subject is very anxious to return
to Europe and, if possible, Faris. UNHOVED has maintained his contacts with
other high officials in Faris, who have told him that they are "lost with-
cut"Subject and would be very glad to see kia back in Faris. It also seems
apparent that Subject left
under favorable circumstances and would be
willing to return (and they would accept hin) provided his financial situation
were satisfactorily settled.
4. If Subject still interests you, I suggest you endeavor to contact
him at his hotel in New York.
