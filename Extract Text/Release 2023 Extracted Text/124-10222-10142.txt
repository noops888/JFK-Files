THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION. SOURCE GRADINGS ARE DEFINITIVE. APPRAISAL OF CONTENT IS TENTATIVE.
An official British service from a regular source, probably
reliable, from persons mentioned in the report.'
In a private conversation on 4 May. 1964 a member of the Frente
de Obreros Revolucionario Cubanos (FORC, Front of Revolutionary
Cuban Workers)1 claimed that the following exile groups were
conniving to take action against Cuba within the next few months:
the Junta Revolucionaria Cubana (JURE, Cuban Revolutionary Junta);
the Movimiento de Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MRR, Movement for
Revolutionary Recovery); the Ejercito Rebelde (ER, Rebel Army);
and the "Alliance" of the Movimiento Revolucionario Popular (MRP,
Popular Revolutionary Movement) the Segundo Frente Nacional del
Escambray (SFNE, Second National Front of the Escambray, and
Alpha 66.
JURE, the ER, and the "Alliance" were planning to enter Cuba to
prepare the groundwork for internal insurrection, while the MRR
was to carry out diversionary hit-and-run attacks on the Cuban \
coasts. Meanwhile, the FORC was building up its own clandestine
organization among the workers in Cuba, its aim is to organize
sabotage and slow-downs in Cuban industries, thus paving the way
for an eventual general strike. FORC claims to have the support
of the Confederacion de Trabajadores Venezolanos (CTV, Venezuelan
Workers' Confederation) and of the Confederacion Lat moamericana
de Sindicatos Cristianos (CIASC, Latin American Christian Trade
Union.) NOT RECORDED
On 6 Mal7aJohnnie, who is independent of any exile organi-
zation, claimed that all exile groups, including JURE, have the
active bocking of the United States. JURE was said to have
received arms and other material from the United States in recent
months.
