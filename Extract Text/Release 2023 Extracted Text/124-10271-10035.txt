INTERCEPTION OF COMMUNICATIONS
Our Atlanta Office has advised on 7/15/74, that
Howard Gibson, 1746 Hammondwood Circle, Powder Springs,
Georgia, furnished information regarding an alleged wiretap
of the telephone of U. S. Senator Howard Baker at Washington,
D. C. (WDC). Gibson is identified as a former Deputy Sheriff
in Cobb County, Georgia, who was forced to resign after he was
alleged to have fired a gun into the house of a narcotics
informant with whom he had a dispute. Subsequently, Gibson
was employed by a private investigative organization known as
Central Investigative Agency, 6650 Powers Ferry Road, NW,
Atlanta, Georgia.
On 7/11/74, Gibson advised that Central Investigative
Agency maintains a branch office known as Security Consultants
International (SCI) at 1028 Connecticut Avenue, Suite 1109,
WDC. A portion of the office space leased by SCI was recently
sub-leased to one Lucein-Conein (phonetic), allegedly an
official of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA);
Special Operations Group, WDC. Gibson claims he was the
business partner in the office of the Central Investigative
Agency and in SCI with Mitchell Werbell, III, who resides at
Powder Springs, Georgia. The offices of SCI in WDC, have
been managed by John Muldoon, a retired Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) agent..
Gibson suspects that Conein is actually a covert
CIA agent and further suspects CIA has been operating a
wiretap out of the space leased from SCI. Gibson bases
these suspicions on statements made by Werbell alleging
that he has worked for CIA in the past; that he is friends
with CIA agents and officials; that he believes Conein to
be an ex-CTA agent and knows that John Muldoon is a former
CIA agent.

Long to Gebhardt Memo
Re:
Alleged tapping of telephone of
U. S. Senator Howard Baker
Gibson advised that during the course of a normal
working day two or three men usually enter and work in the
sub-leased SCI space. They stay during the course of an
entire day without leaving the space and do not seem to
conduct business in a normal manner. An unidentified
friend of Gibson's overheard individuals in the space,
allegedly leased by DEA, discussing "tapes." Based on the
above information and based on Gibson's experience with
wiretapping while employed with the Cobb County, Georgia,
Sheriff's Office, Gibson believes a wiretapping operation
was being conducted in the space allegedly sub-leased by
DEA from SCI.
Since it appeared that an ongoing CIA operation
was being compromised and that the CIA should be aware,
our Atlanta Office contacted Mr. Rov Green, CIA, Atlanta
(Covert) and informed him of the apove on 7/11/74..
On 7/12/74, Gibson furnished the following:
Directly above Suite 1109, rented by SCI at
1028 Connecticut Avenue, is a suite located on the
twelfth floor, which is utilized as an efficiency apartment.
It is connected to Suite 1109 on the floor below by stairway.
Gibson said the twelfth floor space is actually the space
sub-leased to Conein and that telephone number 785-4514 is
installed in that space. Conein sub-leased this apartment
in March, 1974, and was still being used by Conein as of
7/5/74.
Regarding the information above concerning the
alleged overhearing of discussions concerning "tapes," by
alleged DEA employees, Gibson advised this information
was furnished to him by Mr. Steve Van Cleave, a personal
friend of Gibson's and a private investigator from
Atlanta, Georgia. Van Cleave told Gibson that he
visited SCI offices on a recent unrecalled date. Van Cleave
was told by Werbell that Van Cleave could not stay in the
offices at that time as Werbell was consulting with a
client. Van Cleave told Gibson he then went to the twelfth
floor entryway to SCI offices, the space sub-leased by
Conein, and overheard a conversation through the door
