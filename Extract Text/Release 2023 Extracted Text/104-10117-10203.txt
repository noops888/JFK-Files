Z
In April 1967 a discussion von held between an Agency representative
and Jin THOMPSON and Ray GEEKS of the WCUTP (World Conte
Organizations of the Teaching Frofession) concerning future funding for
Confederation of
WCOIP. Because of publicity concerning the funding of HOOP by the Vernon hand,
HCOTP leadership promised its membershi membership that no further Vernon Fund marvey
would be accepted until the status of the Vernon Fund van clarified. John
THOMPSON felt that the best slution would be a one-time only infusion of
money by sterile check into the SCOTP bank account to be backstopped by a
Lotter from the attorney for the Vernon Find, Bryce REA, who would attribute
the money to maubers of the Vernon Fund Board who anonymously wished to
provide MCOTP with sufficient sunda to cover expenses until other sources
could be found.
In May 1967 John THOMPSON of the WOOTP described to an Agency repre
sentative an interview he had with Mike MacHANUS of TIME magazine on
1 Hay 1967 who wanted to discuss the effects of newspaper publicity on
WCOLP operations. HecMANUS was especially interested in any econputes forced
on WCOPP sad a request for proof of the value of COIP operations to individual
teachers. THOMPSON felt that MaaMANUS did not succeed in gaining sufficient
additional information from the interview to warrant writing his projected
erticio.
