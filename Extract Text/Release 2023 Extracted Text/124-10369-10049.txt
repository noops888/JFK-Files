EPOLEASE IN PART
TADENIAL
In winding up my affairs at the Department of State, there is a pend-
ing matter which I believe merits your attention.
:
Lee Harvey Oswald, the presumed assassin of President Kennedy, was
alledgedly present at a party given by a Mexican communist sympathizer
and attended by the Cuban Consul, a veteran intelligence officer, when
he was in Mexico shortly before the assassination. There are allega-
tions that the Mexican Government may have been aware of Oswald's
presence at that party and that the Cuban Government may have tried to
intimidate others who saw him there.
A careful investigation of these allegations could perhaps explain
them away. Until then, however, their public disclosure could reopen
the debate about the true nature of the Kennedy assassination and
damage the credibility of the Warren Report.
Since I was the Embassy officer in Mexico who acquired this intelli-
gence information, I feel a responsibility for seeing it through to
its final evaluation. Accordingly, I have prepared a memorandum
(enclosed) explaining this information and its initial assessment, keyed
to three memoranda of conversations with my Mexican informant.
I believe you would want to consider carefully whether to let well
enough alone in this case, or whether the risks attending possible
public disclosure of these allegations make further investigation
warranted.
Respectfully,
Thom

MEMORANDUM
July 25, 1969
SUBJECT: Investigation of Lee Harvey Oswald in Mexico
1. While serving as Political Officer in the U.S. Embassy in Mexico
City from 1964 to 1967, I became quite friendly with the Mexican play-
right, Elena Garro de Paz. An intellegent, witty, and outspoken woman,
I found her a very useful if sometimes biased source of political gossip
and personal history on significant Mexican personalities. She introduced
my wife and me to many important people in Mexico. She was also parti-
cularly knowledgeable about agrarian affairs. A biographic report that
I prepared on her on May 3, 1966 is attached (Tab A).
I
2. On one occasion, Miss Garro inadvertently mentioned to me that she
had been at a party with Lee Harvey Oswald and two American companions
when Oswald was in Mexico just before the Kennedy assassination. The
party had been at the home of her cousin, Ruben Duran. The memorandum
of that conversation, dated December 10, 1965, is attached (Tab B).
had not read the Warren Report, but I assumed that if Oswald had been
to such a party in Mexico, it would have been well known to the Embassy.
I also knew Miss Garro to be something of a professional anti-communist
who tended to see a communist plot behind any untoward political event.
However, the episode about her being escorted into hiding at an obscure
hotel intrigued me. Accordingly, I decided to report the matter in
writing. I gave the memorandum of conversation limited distribution
within the Embassy, and did not send any copies to Washington.
3. A few days later I was called to the office of Mr. Winston Scott,
who headed the Embassy's Political Research Section (CIA). Also present
was Mr. Nathan Ferris, the Embassy's Legal Attache (FBI). They had noted
with interest my December 10 memorandum of conversation. They pointed
out that there had been a great many rumors about Oswald at the time of
the assassination and that some could not be verified and others had
proved false. They asked me, however, to try and get a more detailed
replay of Miss Garro's story. Mr. Scott made clear that the FBI had full
responsibility for any further investigations of the Oswald case!
4. In a memorandum of conversation dated December 25, 1965 (Tab C), I
provided a much more detailed and accurate restatement of Miss Garro's
alleged encounter with Oswald and subsequent developments. Certain errors
in my original presentation were corrected. Miss Garro guessed that the
date of the party at her cousin's house was in early September, 1963. She
admitted that she had gone to the Embassy to report briefly about this matter
on an earlier occasion.

Durans after the assassination about a party which Oswald had reportedly
attended, but that the transcript of the interrogation was entirely
unsatisfactory by normal investigatory standards. Furthermore, the party
inquired. about was not the one at Ruben Duran's house, reported by
Elena Garro, but at an entirely different place. This transcript may
well be the source of Mr. Ferris' belief that Elena Garro's story had been
checked out and found to be untrue.
10. It would appear that whereas the FBI has discounted the Elena Garro
allegations, the CIA is still considerably disturbed by them. The CIA
may not have pressed for further investigation, however, for a number of
reasons: 1) considering the sensitive overlap and subtle competition
between two intelligence collecting agencies, it had to yield to the
FBI's clear jurisdiction; 2) there are obvious complications in conducting
such an investigation in a foreign country; 3) there is a close and
delicate relationship between the CIA Station Chief and the former Minister
of Interior
President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz; and 4) some of the people
appearing in the Elena Garro scenario may well be agents of the CIA. Under
the circumstances it is unlikely that any further investigation of this
matter will ever take place unless it is ordered by a high official in
Washington.
11. If all the allegations in the attached memoranda were true, they
would not, in themselves, prove that there was a conspiracy to assassinate
President Kennedy. However, if they were ever made public, those who
have tried to discredit the Warren Report could have a field day in
speculating about their implications. The credibility of the Warren Report
would be damaged all the more if it were learned that these allegations
were known and never adequately investigated by the competent American
authorities.
12. Reference is made again to the biographic report (Tab A) on Elena
Garro. She is hardly an ordinary or average person. Her strengths and
weaknesses become exaggerated precisely because she is not. It would
be easy and convenient to sweep this matter under the rug by claiming
that Miss Garro is an unreliable informant since she is emotional,
opinionated, and "artistic." I have been affected at times by that
temptation, myself. No American official, however, knows her better than
I do. On the basis of the facts that I have presented, I believe that,
on balance, the matter warrants further investigation.
13. Finally, the record should show that a representative of a major
American publication has at least some knowledge of this story.

it should be classified "Secret No Foreign Dissemination

information furnished byla sensitive source in the Israeli COU
field. In the event f prepares a communication which may
subsequently be disseminated and which includes information
from FF 568-5, the cover communication should explicitly
state that the LHM, or report, contains information which

Since there is no indication that subject is presently
in the Arred Services, it being noted that in his letter to
INS, above, he furnished his employment as Vitro Laboratories,
Silver Spring, lid., and the fact that his exect location is
unknown, no recommendation is being made to further identify

further requested that designate a copy of its reply to
