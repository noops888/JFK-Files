the latter part of Must or wtember. UCKER is connected with
the Washington law firm of lackhat, Vecker & Dorsey, harilers of legal
Fatters for the Dominican Republic in the nited States. BSCKER told
FAJEU that news of his epility as a promoter end investigator had renched
the ears of Nanuel DE CA in the Dominican Remublic and thet DE MOYA
wanted to know if usuld be interested in coring to the Dominican Pem
public to diseis/possible emlowent by the Lorinicans as an investicator
in 1) the case of Jesus doz, and 2) in ascertaining who is behind
the currert, AnternatiAl campain of discrediting the Ceneralissimo. Ac-
cording to GOR, the Prinicans believe that an alert, well-trained Aver-
ican such as Aint world be able to handle such matters and that money vola
be no problem that if /be accepted the assigment, MAHEU could spend as ruch
as he wanted in the pocess.
3. Your desk officer informed the KISODA official that certainly no harm
would result if HHEU cerely traveled to the Dominican Republic to listen to
DE HOYA: however, if he cid make the trip, he should rake no commitments to DS

turned to Washington. In addition, your desk officer told the CDA official that
MAIFU should try to remember all names and dates rentioned by TE CA and to ex-
ercise Rutincione
