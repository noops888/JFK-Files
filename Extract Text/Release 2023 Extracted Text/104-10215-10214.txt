1. Subject is identified in reference which also gives his personal
data and is forwarded in a separate pouch. Paragraph 4 of that dispatch
outlines the cover activities of Subject for the period 1949 to the present,
during which he has been actually omployed by KUBANK, Cirst as a contract
agent then, since May 1967, as a career agent. He currently receives a
salary approximately equivalent to that of e 15-11.
2. Subject's current, extended tour with the Havana station comes to
an end in May 1958; due to his operational aperience and performance with
KUBARK in Costa Rica, Guatemala and Havana, Subject appears to be a good
prospect as a replacement for Floyd POSTANY in CP Operations.
3. Originally scheduled to be used by KUBARK in Fanaaa, Subject vas
instead assigned to Costa isa in 1948 under the HUMANOID project. khile
the operational files of this project have not yet been reviewed by this
desk, ontries in his personal file show that while in Costa Rica he handled
a successful high level penetration of the local party. At the end of
1953, after a pemod of training at Headquarters, he was assigned to
PBSUCCESS where he apparently also performed creditably. In July 1954 he
was re-assigned to the Harana station as the principal agent of project
AMTHODARCH which involves the recruitment and handling of CF penetrations
in that country. The AMARCH and Subject's personal files have been
reviewed by this desky together with the training and the assessments of
the case officers for whom he has worked, the files show that Subject is
eminently qualified as a recruiter and agent handler in CP operations.
The records show that Subject possesses a great deal of integrity, resource
fullness and intelligence: he was highly rated both by Headquarters
training officers and throughout his operational work in the field. He is
particularly evaluated highly as to judgment and common sense.

8. Your cover story for having been engaged by the Public Surveys
Institute is as follove:
During a visit to the United States in Fay 1957, you became ..
acquainted with Albert E. Johnson, the Director of Public Burveyo
Institute. Johnson indicated that he was interested in engaging
the services of several people to organize and conduct polls in
various Latin American areas...
Since you were already located in Cuba and bed a knowledge of
the language and customs, he expressed an interest in employing
jou in Cuba. As you felt this type of work would not conflict
with your photographic efforts, you accepted the position effective
May 1, 1957, in order to have an extra source of income.
Early in 1958, Johnson advised you that he had acquired several
promising accounts who were interested in Mexico and he desired to
transfer you to Mexico City since you had both experience and the
nexesnery language qualification. You readily agreed to the
transfer and planned to leave for Mexico during the latter part
of May after a short vacation in the United States.
