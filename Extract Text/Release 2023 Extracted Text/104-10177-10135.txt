provisions. If this contract is satisfactory please retura it for his signature
at such tino as his clearance is obtained.
2. FULMINATER-1 has shown himself to be very enthusiastic regarding the proposed
employment with this Organisation and is anxious to start the tasks to bo
assigned to hin as scen es his clearance is obtained and the necessary instructions
are fcrwarded to this Station.

paid from other operational funds the peso equivalent of his salary boginning
1 January 1952. It was conátierod necessary to begin his payments es of that
date in order to insure his continued stay in Chile. This Station would
appreciate clarification of JREDICT-Chile to which, according to TC-7-1465,
this expense could be charged for a limited time.
6.5, FULMINATER-I's weekly newspaper is 61% owned by him, and as indicated in
attached contract, he has agreed to keep the paper for at least two years.
The other owner, his has taken no activo interest whatsoever in the operation,
management or policies of the paper, apparently plans to sell his share.
The prospective buyer is not known but in any event PULAMINATER-1 will retain
the controlling interest.
7.
76, FULMINATER-l is willing to spend the necessary time in Washington for
training and will be ready to depart immediately when so advised. However, his
wife is expecting a baby around 30 December 1951 according to her doctor's
calculations, and FULMINATER-1 would prefer to remain in Santiago for at least
a few days after the child is born. He is certain that the birth will take
place within a week's time and it is hoped that his presence in Washington will
not be required prior to 15 January 1952. As a cover story for his trip,
FULMINATER-1 has advised that an option nas been bought on one of his playe
and that a trip to New York to discuss the play with the prospective producer
is completely logical. Further, he has an estate in Texas which is in litigation
and which could logically require his presence there. PULMINALER-1 asked that
ho do allowed to spend a day or two in Texas either on his trip up or back to
settle thia estate and it is recommended that he be allowed to do so in order to
provide his cover story with more basis in fact.
8.7, FULMINACER-1 has been told that he must pay United States income tax on his
salary received from this Crganization. He is at a loss, however, to know how
this added income can be satisfactorily and securely explained to the Department
of Internal Revenue. In accordance with the contents of Field Regulations 50-15,
this matter is being brought to Headquarters attention with a request for
instructions as to how this matter is to be handled.

Meeting with Agent, Paul D. LAGI on 20 April 1952
1. The sense of the following text was obtained aming
an afternoon meeting with Agent LANGEVI!!. Participating in
the tall: vere Nessrs. Sryser and Patton and Agent LANGEVIN.
Four rajor topics were discussed and will be presented here
in the order in which they were developed.
2. Printing Plant Problem: 1. LANGEVIN indicated that
in two and a half to three months cortain financial obliga-
tions would come due. These consisted entirely in making an
$8,000 payment arising from the purchase of equipment for his
printing establishment. This equipment, which cost about
$10,000 when purchased late in 1951, consists of an Italian-
made press, linotyre machine, Speed Graphic cameras, tyre,
etc. The market value of this equipment (partly new and
partly used) is estimated to be at least $10,000. The sum of
$3,000 represents the total indebtedness of LANGEVIN's plant
and is owed to a Mr. MACKENZIE of Casa Mackonzic. l. LANGEVIN
ray meet this payment by either (1.) securing a loan from a Fort
Worth, Texas, bank using his share in family oil interests as
collateral, (2) taking on a Chilean partner, (3) getting the
money from a Chilean bank (which would involve an 18% interest
rate) or (4) getting the money elsewhere. Common agreement was
expressed on the undesirability of taking on a Chilean partner
since this would be a security hazard in any future Fl work,
and would also eliminate the possibility of using the plant as
cover for another agent. 15. LANGEVIII, asked about his previous
statement about leaving Chile after two years, roplied that now
there was no definite plan or desire in that direction. Бе
indicated he would have some idea about the possibility of
assistance from a Texas bark within a few weeks. T. LANGEVIN
also suggested that he would gladly use his earnings for the
next two years from the agency ($6,000 per year) if the Agency
could put up the $8,000 in a lump sum. The printing firm is
now making a profit above the salary which LANGEVIN takes out.
3. Priering on the Comittee: Mr. SIYSER discussed the
overall tasks which LANGEVII is expected to perform. Much
emphasis was placed on the need for security in explaining
this type of IW activity, particularly if and when DTHABELS is

unauthorized person in Chile knew of his U. S. Government
activities.
4. Information on

discretion of
LAANGEVIII indicated complete confidence,
stating that she was very efficient and would be useful in
assisting him in Pl work. LANGEVIN was thoroughly briefed on
the fact that

nection with the committee.
5. Words and Deeds: Mr. LANGEVIN stated that the format,
paper, type and photoengraving of this pamphlet was far above
Chilean standards. He said that Chile had only one printing
house capable of producing such work, and no artists of the
caliber exhibited in the pamphlet.
The reproduction of posi-
tives is also not done in his plant, but must be contracted for
at a Santiago photoengraver's.
6. Bank: Details: Mr. LANGEVIN has opened an account at
the Chemical Bank and Trust, 74th Street and Madison Avenue,
New York City. All future monthly payments will be rade to
that bank, beginning with the payment for April.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTOR (PLANS)
SUBJECT:
Project PBGROVEL, Amendment No. 1
1. Amendment No. 1 to Project PBGROVEL proposes the loan
of the sum of $8,000 at 4% interest per annum to a contract agent
in Santiago, Chile, in order that this agent may complete payment
on machinery and equipment recently installed on the premises of
the printing establishment of which said agent is sole proprietor.
2. The propriety of CIA lending funds for this purpose has
been reviewed by Opo/SRI who is of the opinion that in principle
there should be no objection. The question of operational use by
Opo has been raised with the WH Division and it has been stated
that this oquipment, consisting of the press, linotype machine,
Speed Graphic cameras, etc., can be used for Opc propaganda pro-
duction purposes.
3. The question of control of the contract agent was dis-
cussed and it has been determined that the Goneral Counsel's Of-
fice is being requested to establish legal means whereby the liên
or mortgage on this equipment will be held in the name of a cut-
out. In the event of any untoward action on the part of the con-
tract agent or disagreement between the agent and CIA, action can
be taken to assumo control of the machinery.
4. As is indicated in the attached memorandum from the Chief,
WH Division, the contract agent is considered to be an individual
of high intelligence and personal integrity. For this and the
above listed reasons, it is recommended that Amendment No. 1 to
PBGROVEL be approved in the amount of $8,000.

6. As a prerequisite to the issuance of a loan, LANGEVIN
ould be required to subrit a complete name-plate inven-
tory of all machinery and equipment involved in the loan
transaction and its physical existence in his custody,
his title to the property, and an approximate evaulation
of its worth would be determined through WWD station per-
sonnel.
B. Background
Contract agent, Paul D. LANGEVIK, is the sole owner and editor
of the. English-language paper, South Pacific Mail, which is
published weekly in Santiago, Chile. The printing of this
publication was formerly done by an outside firm. Desiring to
handle both his own printing requirements and to engage in job
printing, LANGEVII obtained equipment from an individual who
expected to be compensated through a partnership in the busi-
ness. However, serious illness has prevented the prospective
partner from entering the business, and hos forced LANGEVII! to
meet the financial obligation alone. The repayment of this
obligation will recufre LANGEVIN either (1) to accept a Chilean
partner in his business, or (2) to obtain a loan. The require-
ments of security and the need for flexibility of operation
militate against bringing in a partner. Foreover, a loan ob-
tained locally through ordinary commercial channels, 1.e.
banks, would entail exorbitant interest rates. In addition,
since a bank loan would almost certainly be of short-term
duration; there would exist the constant threat of loss of the
cover business through a possible refusal to renew the loan.
LANGEVIN has contacted a bank: in Texas in an attempt to secure
a loan, offering as cearity his chare of a family interest in
⚫oil-producing lands. It appears doubtful that the Texas bank:
will grant the loan.

Ageng loan (See Annex A). After consultation with the Correr-
cial and Legal Divicfons, ID advised LGE by cable, ester
his return to Chile, not to complete ary lean arrangements with-
ent nothing Headquarters (See Annex.3). It was decided that
a lean on the Agency, under the terms cutlined in the proposal,
presented the best solution for the agency from the standpoint
of security, and that such a loan would give the Agency even
greater control over the agent than now exists.
