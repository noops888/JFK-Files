SUBJECT: MOSBY, Aline
Karl KOCH, Acting Chief Temporary Move Bureau in Brussels
advised on 1 September 1958 that he had attended a cocktail party on
(of August given by a Miss Aline MOSBY. He stated that she is
North American Newspaper Alliance, is about 30 years old, was
fired from a wire service in the USA for having leaked information
confidential magazine. He stated that she plays footed, is a
and is a co-existence type, stated that she is a very good writer, is employed
as a stringer for NANA and that he had used her often.
Also in attendance at the party was
Boris BELITSKIY, a technician with Radio Moscow. When Mr. KOCH
to Miss MOSBY during his temporary stay in Brussels, Mr.
BELITSKIY accepted the invitation. He asked Miss MOSBY not to say anything
to the cocktail party. BELITSKIY is approximately 36 years of age, lived
in the United States, 1927-1931 while his father was on a trade mission
there. BELITSKIY has been criticized by the regime for his friendliness
with Westerners so that at other than social affairs then he is in private
Western correspondents he merely gives a nod but then he is in private
quite friendly. He apparently has less money than other correspondents.
It was learned that he had saved a little nest egg of about $2000 which
he wished to use to try out a system he had devised to use in the casinos.
We had asked a Miss Frieda LAJM who is a correspondent at the Brussels
Exhibition if she could get him into the Casino Ostend without
his having to show any credentials. He was planning to go on the 4th and
5th of September.
This information was passed to Chris.
BELITSKIY was asked if additional information on his colleagues could be
the opportunity presented itself when Mr. KOCH called me
before office hours on 3 September and stated that he had been invited by
BELITSKIY to take a ride in the country. I asked KOCH to try and get more
biographical data on BELITSKIY, where his family was, what his father was
doing, how long he was going to be in Brussels. On 5 September Mr. KOCH
called and advised that BELITSKIY was a nice chap fellow, that he had suffered
under STALIN and apparently not too friendly to the regime but was basically
nationalistic. I asked Mr. KOCH if he had made an approach to
said definitely no. Mr. KOCH is preparing a report with all information.
His report will be forthcoming within the next two or three days.
