1. The information provided in the reference dispatch was not of such
assistance in annaring ODEVY inquiries, 14 sould appear that an
Indigenons agent with palico cover, for instance, would have had more than so
of obtaining inferention of valve than did PRIDOR, and possibly an
inforzal request through police courdes would have been productive. More
pleming shald have gone into the operation.
2. No indication is Aven in the referencs as to the furrent status of the
investigation, It 18 assumed that the case will be kept open, and that
further efforts dil be made to procure the information requested.
However, in thstances such as this the Station should always indiesta
what further actions are proposed, or at least that the investigation
is being continued.

Reference: HRS-W-449, 5 November 1954
1.
In reference, Headquarters requested coverage of the
Puerto Limón area to follow up a tip to ODNVY that
Subject, American Communist Party fugitive, was/hiding
there.
2. The Station sent HUMIDOR to Puerto Limón for the period
13-15 November to investicate the report. HUMIDOR was
instructed to watch especially waterfront area bars,
which Subject assertedly frouented. HUMIDOR was cautioned
not to become involved with Subject, but only to try to
identify him from the the photo raph raph forwarded San José by
Headquarters, and ten to try to learn where Subject
lived, if possible.
3.
On is return to San Jose, HUMIDOR reported that he had
had no luck in spotting Subject. HUMIDOR said that thore
aro no bars along the waterfront area in Puerto Limón,
but customs-houses, acianas and railway buildings. The
first bars are located a out a block up the street from
the waterfront. HUMIDOR checked the cantinas, most of
which are located near the central market place, among
them such likely han-outs as the Salon Central and the
New Harlem Bar. He also covered Negro dance halls, as
well as the Barrio Ciena ulta, arun-down loro suburb
noar the airport. HUMIDOR reported that it was like
looking for a needle in a haystack, since the population
of Puerto Limón is largely ero. no said that he could
not claim definitely that Subject was not there, HUMIDOR
stated that Subject could be in hidin, or he could have
missed seeing him if he does appear publicly. For example,

DOR said that many of the f the Puerto Limón món dives have
"reservados" - booths with closed doors-in which an
individual could remain unseen for hours. HUIDOR sald
that with more time, a moromthorough investigative check
could be made, with such sleuthing techniques as chniques as checking
the regro and Chinese cantina crowd for information on
an obviously american lepo, with no Jamaican accent.
Another potential source of information on Subject's
whereabouts would ts would be Negro sailors in Puerto Limón who
work shipping between Puerto Limón and Gulf and Atlantic
