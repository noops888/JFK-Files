The report also says, here, none of this other
activity would seem to warrant Castro's associating
that activity with U. S. leaders to the extent that he
would threaten the safety of American leaders aiding
the plans." We note without exception.

Footnote *. The Cuban Coordinating Committee was
a group for coordinating implementation of established
programs. By memorandum of 22 May 1963, McGeorge
Bundy, Special Assistant to President Kennedy for
National Security Affairs, designated the State Depart-
ment Coordinator of Cuban Affairs as Chairman of the
Interdepartmental Committee on Cuba with the specific
responsibility for the coordination of day-to-day actions
regarding Cuba. Membership of the Committee con-
sisted of representatives from State, USIA, DOD, CIA,
Justice, Treasury and ad hoc representatives as
necessary.
Footnote **. This seems to indicate that the FBI
learned of CIA's operations on 10 October 1963
(a new date?) and that this led to termination of the
AMLASH operation. Of course, that happened much
later.

"Special Affairs Staff" should read "Special Activities
Staff. "
Page 41.
SASICI should read SAS/CI.
Page 47.
Testimony of Karamessines is quoted, in which he is
asked a hypothetical question about use of AMLASH,
and that he answered hypothetically, but the presentation
seems to treat it as fact.
Page 53.
Reference to CIA "technical collection capability in
Mexico City should be deleted. Simply delete the
word "technical" This small point is a sources-
1
and-methods question.

It is requested that CIA support for DRE, JURE
and the 30th November Movement groups be altered
to a generic description of anti-Castro groups.
Persons identified with them in some circles could
suffer from official confirmation of the connection.
This is still considered as classified. It is noted
that CIA did not have an operational interest in
SNFE or Alpha 66.

The Agency effort to obtain FPCC stationery
through a penetration for use in a deception
operation is still classified since it involves
sources and methods.
Page 129. That the SAS Executive Officer views the AMLASH
operation as having been an assassination plot is
not very helpful, unless the time sequence and
evolution of the relationship with AMLASH/1 is
made a part of that view. His account in 1967
supported FitzGerald's story of what happened
in the 29 October 1963 meeting.
That SAS/CI speaks broadly may not be all that
helpful either, if the extent of his knowledge,
and when he knew what he says he knew, is
fixed in time. That he wrote a memorandum in
1965 on the security of the operation, does not
qualify him to address where things stood in
1963. In fact, he is quoted at page 139 as saying
that he could not recall the time frame.
Page 133.
The draft report states that in October 1963 the
FBI knew of the "assassination aspect of the
AMLASH" operation. As is noted earlier,
there was no such characterization that applied
to it then, so how it could have known is subject
to question.

Page 161. The 1967 IG report did not consider the issue of when
the operational relationship with AMLASH/1 developed
to the point where AMLASH/1 could feel he had CIA
support for his plans. It simply dealt with events as
they unfolded. The report was used as a primary
source for the brief capsulized summary of the AMLASH
operation that preceded this detailed series of comments.
General. It is requested that reference to cables follow the general
practice employed in the SSC report on alleged assassination
plots. The date the cable was sent, the quoted portion, and
the country of origin should suffice. Specific reference to
a CIA "Station should be deleted; specific designation of a
CIA station tion in a given city can create undesirable difficulties.
References to IN and OUT numbers, or DIR numbers, and to
the date and time group of a cable, provide information that
is subject to hostile communications analysis and should
be removed. This technique for treating cables permits
the basic story to be told without providing unnecessary and
harmful, from a security point of view, information.
Instances in the draft presenting the question were noted
at pages 41, 46, 49, and 57. In addition, although JMWAVE
has already been identified officially in SSC published reports,
the basic treatment of communications cited in relation to
that Station should otherwise receive similar technical
treatment; see pages 19, 19a, 56, 106 and 138.
Special. Page 51 cites the CIA Chief of Station reading a cable to
the President of Mexico. CIA relations with the President
of a foreign country here, specifically, the President of
Mexico is extremely sensitive, both operationally and
politically. The revelation of this relationship could affect
adversely ongoing and future operations in Mexico, as well
as being a particularly irritating embarrassment to the
Mexican Government.
