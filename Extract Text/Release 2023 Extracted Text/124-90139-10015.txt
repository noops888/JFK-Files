Memorandum to Mr. Brennan
RE: MARIA CELIA GIRONA SANCHEZ
ANTONIO DE SOUZA CARVOJAL
(8)
The foregoing was furnished to the Liaison Agent on
November 29, 1963, by Austin Horn, CIA, who inquired if the Bureau
had any objection to CIA initiating an approach of the subjects
through the use of Baralt
OBSERVATIONS:
Baralt.(S)(U)
It is the opinion of the Liaison Agent that CIA does
not have a strong foundation for initiating an approach as indicated.
The Agency could be on a fishing expedition and we may find it
desirable to object to CIA's proposed action in the absence of
additional information. We also should bear_in mind that the
Bureau is free to consider the use of Baralt if we felt this (U)
operation should be handled by the Bureau.
ACTION:
The above information is being directed to the attention
of the Nationalities Intelligence Section. It is suggested that
its reply to CIA be transmitted via Liaison.
