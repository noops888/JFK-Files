A source, who has furnished reliable information
in the past, advised during February, 1972, that Davida Fineman,
a member of the pro-Chinese communist, Marxist-Leninist
Revolutionary Union, advised during February, 1972, that she
continues to be in occasional contact with the individual known
to your Agency under the cryptonym "Sugar," and she refuses to
believe that this individual is employed as an operative of
your Agency. Fineman stated that she is also in contact with
Rene Raindorf, pro-Chinese communist Marxist-Leninist of Belgium.
Fineman indicated she was familiar with Roger Padgett
(phonetic) who has served as a professor at Cornell University
and at the University of Colorado at Boulder. The same source
indicated that he too was acquainted with Padgett (phonetic)
and that Padgett (phonetic) had admitted to the source he had
worked for your Agency as an advisor to former President Sukarng
of Indonesia for six years

Fineman also volunteered that Gloria Steinem,
prominent Women's Liberation advocate, was employed by your
Agency. (0)
The above is for your information, and no further

The following information was furnished by a
confidential source abroad on February 4, 1972:
According to the source, a pro-Palestinian organization
called the Palestine Committee-Brussels was organized during
1970 within the Belgian National Palestine Committee for the
purpose of supporting Palestinian revolutionary activities.
The Brussels Committee was headed by Luc Dupire, a Belgian
national born on April 9, 1942, at Haine St. Paul, and the
National Palestine Committee by Aron Raindorf, a Belgian citizen
born on December 22, 1919, at St. Gilles.
Following a period during which the two groups
worked in harmony, a schism took place in November, 1971, which
resulted in a new group being formed by Dupire and Yvonne Sterck
which was called The Responsible Group for the National
Palestinian Committee and the Palestinian Committee-Brussels
without other members of either group being consulted. Raindorf,
according to the source, is currently attempting to regain
control over divergent elements and to restore order to the
4groups involved.
In this connection, Raindorf traveled to London where
he remained from December 26 through December 28, 1971, and
met with one Gibson, described only as an American Negro journalist
and with an individual known as Manchanda, described as being
of Pakistani origin. The source indicated Manchanda is probably
identical to Albert Manchanda, a British citizen born on
April 9, 1919, in India. Raindorf also traveled to Beirut,
Lebanon, on January 20, 1972, and to Damascus, Syria, to meet
with elements of the Fath and the O.L.P. which were not further
described by the source.

conclusions of the FBI. It is the property of the FBI and is
