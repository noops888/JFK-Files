MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Security Management Staff/DD/S&T
SUBJECT : (BYECOM Approvals for Office of Security
General Support Officers
1. On occasion of the required semi-annual review of holders
of compartmented clearances, the SSC proposed and the Director of
Security approved the concept that the majority of professional security
officers at the Headquarters level could effectively perform all
necessary security support in the BYE System within the limits of
a liberal interpretation of the access permitted by the BYECOM
clearance as opposed to the individual project clearances.
2. Accordingly, the review of OS holders of compartmented
clearances indicates that 37 officers listed below should be granted the
(BYECOM) clearance. This will permit us to debrief them of 148
individual (BYEMAN) clearances. The Chief, Compartmented Information
Branch has been requested to mark the CIB control records so as to
alert the SSC any time within the next year a request for certification
of (BYEMAN access comes from outside the Agency. The SSC with
your cooperation will seek to insure that the the (BYECOM clearance
does not serve as a barrier in the discharge of general (BYEMAN)
security support duties.
3. It is suggested that you endorse this memorandum in
approval of the (BYECOM) for all individuals listed. This action will
serve the CIB as the necessary DD/S&T (BYECOM) authorization and
eliminate the need for 37 individual Form 2018a's.

I heartily agree with this proposal but there is one item
which I feel might be explored. When I was in the Special Security
Center we occasionally called on the then Chief of Personnel
Security Division, Mr. Steven Kuhn, Mr. Leland E. Bunn, or Mr. Ward
K. Greene to conduct defensive briefings. In the course of con-
ducting such briefings, I feel that it is possible that they might
not be able to give meaningful answers to questions propounded by
the persons being briefed. I would recommend that this matter be
discussed with Mr. Bunn, Mr. Greene, and Mr. Kotapish, successor
to Mr. Kuhn, prior to debriefing them of all operational access
approvals and giving them (BYECOMS.)
Bunn, Greene & Kotapish have
never been called on during defensive briefings
to discuss clearances in substantive depth.
Further, the (Byecom) would not preclude them
from discussing such questions.
