ABSTRACT
MICROFILM
ACCOM
PLISHED
1. THE POSTPONEMENT OF AELADLE'S DEBRIEFING BY THE GERMAN
REPRESENTATIVES HAS AFFORDED US A BREATHING SPELL OF WHICH WE WOULD
LIKE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE BY ASKING YOU A FEW QUESTIONS. WE UNDERSTAND
FROM CARSON AND NEETH THAT AELADLE WAS SCHEDULED TO BE SURFACED IN
THE NEAR FUTURE AND THAT THIS WOULD HAVE A GREAT IMPACT ON MOST NATO
COUNTRIES. DO YOU INTEND TO DISCUSS THE SURFACING WITH THE GERMANS
IF AND WHEN THEY COME TO WASHINGTON, IF NOT, WOULD YOU BE KIND
ENOUGH TO GIVE US SUFFICIENT FORWARNING OF THE IMPENDING SURFACING
INCLUSIVE OF SCENARIO AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION TO ENABLE US TO
ENGAGE IN INFORMATIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR LIAISON PARTNERS BOTH 11
11 GERMAN AND AMERICAN. IF WOULD ENHANCE OUR POSITION WITH OUR GERMA
CIAISON PARTNERS IF WE WERE ABLE TO ANSWER MOST OF THE QUESTIONS
WHICH MIGHT ARISE FROM PUBLIC STATEMENTS MADE BY AELADLE EVEN IF THEY
CONCERN COUNTRES AND MATTERS NOT OF IMMEDIATE CONCERN TO WEST
GERMANY PER SE.
2. EXPERIENCE HAS TAUGHT US, FOR INSTANCE, THAT PRESS UT ERANCES.
BY HIGH LEVEL DEFECTORS WILL PROMPT DCSI AND EVEN CINCUSAREUR TO
REQUEST BACKGROUND AND OTHER INFORMATION FROM CHIEF OF STATION,
GERMANY. IF POSSIBLE WE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO REPRESENT OUR
HEADQUARTERS IN A KNOWLEDGEABLE MANNER USAREUR SELDOM RELIES ON
ACSI.
3. AN EARLY ANSWER WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED.
