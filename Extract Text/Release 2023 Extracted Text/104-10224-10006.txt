SUMMARY OF AGENCY EMPLOYMENT
JAMES W. MCCORD, JR.
Service with the Central Intelligence Agency began on 22
Angust 1951 and continued through-31 August 1970. During his
career there was a variety of assignments involving investigations,
research and report writing, technical and physical security programs
and a two year tour overseas.
"As an investigator during the first two years of employment,
there was wide involvement in a variety of support activities requiring
initiative and ingenuity.
During the seven years engaged in research and report writing,
there was much independence of action and success depended on
initiative, imagination and resourcefulness in pioneering new areas
of interest. Beginning in May 1957, managerial responsibilities
began with appointment to a Deputy Chief position of a research staff
of some six professional and clerical personnel.
When serving overseas, responsibilities were managerial in
nature as Chief of a regional staff of some ten professional and
clerical personnel providing a full spectruin of security support.
From August 1964 to June 1965 he attended the Air War
College as representative of the Agency.
Since 1965 two vital line positions were held involving the
Agency's programs in the technical and physical security fields.
In heading up the technical security division, from 1965 to
1963, he had primary supervisory responsibility for some 40
professional and clerical personnel, preparing the budget and pro-
grams for the Agency's technical security program, and managing
the obligating of authorized funding to assure that approved programs
and goals were met. He was instrumental in guiding the development
of new approaches, in establishing new training concepts and in
bringing the Agency to a position of recognized leadership in this
fielć.

Since October 1968, as Chief of a division responsible for
the Agency's physical security program he had primary responsibility
for the supervision of some 70 professional and clerical personnel,
together with the programming, budgeting and implementing of the
total physical security program of the Agency. As a result of his
technological experience, he developed and implemented physical
security programs which produced for the Agency a physical security
posture of pre-eminent quality within the US Government.
