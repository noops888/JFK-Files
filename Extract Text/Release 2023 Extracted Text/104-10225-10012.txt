8. Miguel Angel DIAZ Isalque: I showed P the letter from DIAZ to the
PO Box 982 Coral Gables box; Faid he did not know that address and had no
idea how DIAZ might have got it. I told Pit was a sensitive ad ress which we
did not want to have blown, asked him to contact DIAZ, ostensibly because
KALBING (who long ago was having P prime DIAZ for a trip to Madrid, which
never came off) had sent regards and an explanation of why the Madrid thing
fell thru) Pis to make no mention of the Coral Gables address or the letter,
but assuming DIAZ will bring it up, to try to discover how DIAZ got that address,
while also discovering what it is DIAZ had in mind when he wrote the letter.
P thinks he has DIAZ phone number, if necessary can use the ploy of having
seen DIAZ TV ad for his furniture store>
