which will deal with it directly. The Agency dispatch transmitting a copy of
this memorandum will not be released since it discusses the contents of the...
attachment in such a way as to reveal completely the contents. The Agency
document also contains information confirming the existence of an Agency
station in a specific city abroad, information identifying Agency components
Agency staff employees, Agency cryptonyms and Agency internal filing
instructions. The document is therefore denied under the authority of
exemptions (b) (1), (b)(2) and (b) (3).

The American Consul in Tampico, Mr. Benjamin J. Ruyle,
has sent to the Department of State, Washington, D. C., a letter
of 11 May 1967, a copy of which is herewith attached. It was
sent in response to a request by his desk officer in compliance

2. This report constitutes the first piece of substantive
information about Lee Harvey Oswald's sojourn in Mexico City to
appear since the assassination of President Kennedy. We under-
stand the reluctance of the unidentified source to become
involved, but the fact remains that this information cannot con-
tinue to be withheld or concealed.
3. It is requested that you confer with Mr. Ruyle to deter-
mine the identity of the source and the best way of approaching
him. His desire to stay out of trouble seems likelier to be
gratified through cooperation with U. S. authorities than it
would be if we were forced to turn the matter over to the Mexican
authorities.
It is also requested that you determine whether the
attached information has been made available to LNERGO and, if
it has not, to request that this step be taken...
5. The information needed is the identity of the source, an
approximate date for the two days spent with Oswald, the identities
of all others in contact with Oswald at that time, and a detailed
account of what happened.
6. Although the Warren Commission obtained no facts pointing.
to homosexuality on Oswald's part, this allegation has been made
by elements of the press covering District Attorney Jim Garrison's

this possibility in mind when interviewing the source and others
who spent time with Oswald in Mexico City. It is our hope that
the facts obtained through these interviews will help to confirm
that several of Garrison's allegations about involvement of anti-
Castro Cubans, WOFACT, etc., are false.

Dear Wos:
The missing Lee Harvey Oswald airgram referred to in your letter of
April 14 is Tampico's A-43, which I drafted on March 16. It ought
to have reached you before April 14.
!
I had originally debated with myself whether to send anything at all,
considering my "informant" did not seem to offer anything new. How
ever, in view of the admittedly "electrifying quality" of the subject,
I finally decided to record the matter.
Because of your letter, I invited my friend to lunch today. We went
over the ground in somewhat more detail, as set forth below, but he
did not claim he was making world-shaking revelations, and I do not
believe he was.
:
He said he and a group of fellow students met Oswald one afternoon
(he does not recall the date) when they came out of the Cineclub,
which I understood to be at the Escuela de Filosofía (I am not familiar
with the University of Mexico). He described Oswald as "raro" and
XXXVENEXAM "introvertido", a person who obviously had complexes and
problems.
Oswald was with the group during the remainder of the afternoon and
evening and all the following day. They paid for his meals during this
timo. (It was of interest to me my informant said that, in addition to
recognizing Oswald's photograph following the assassination of President
Kennedy, he easily recalled Oswald's name because both "Harvey" and
"Oswald" connoted rabbit to him, something I had not thought of.)
Oswald evidently had gone to the university to look for pro-Castro students
who might help him persuade the Cuban Embassy to grant him a visą. He
spoke little Spanish, but indicated he was from California, as well as
that he had been a member of a pro-Castro group in New Orleans (no

in the United States had harrassed him ("lo Hostilizagan"). Не
showed an interest in painting and paintings.
My friend reports the Cuban Embassy turned Oswald down from the outset,
apparently in the first place because they had no "previous" on hin
and in the second place because they suspected he was a U.S. agent.
Oswald was deeply upset over being rejected by the Cubans. My
informant used the word "lloraba", but I inferred not literally'. The
group saw no more of Oswald after the second day.
I am not trying to be coy about my "informant's" name. I should
nevertheless like to protect him to the extent possible. He claims
not to have discussed his acquaintance with Oswald with anyone except
me. I take this with a grain of salt, but he does seem genuinely
fearful of losing his job if he is tied publicly to this matter.
He also seems fearful of trouble with his former pro-Castro student
friends if they get the impression he "ratted" on anyone. I gather
they are not altogether "former", considering he says some of them
still visit him here from time to time.
Incidentally, he claims to have visited Cuba, to be well acquainted
with Raul Roa and, to a lesser degree, with Castro. He claims further
to have been friendly with one Maria Teresa Proenza, who I understood
him to say defected from the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City and may now
be in Miami.
One item he "revealed" during our first evening particularly intrigued
me. (He seemed subsequently, and probably with justification, especially
fearful of the unpleasant consequences which might derive from any
publicity regarding it). He asserted he was the student who personally
climbed XXXXXXXXXXXXX the Miguel Aleman statue on the UAM campus with
the dynamite--I believe he said dynamite--when it was mutilated some
years ago.
I am aware my friend my have fabricated everything he told me. My
personal evaluation is that he has been truthful.
Sincerely,
Benjamin J. Ruyle

Disposition This document was denied. The document is a review of
information in the Oswald 201 file which still warrants continued protection
under the classification system. The document identifies and explains the
nature of the hazard that would be involved for a number of foreign intelligence
sources and operational methods if this document or other documents containing
information on the same activities were to be released. The information is
properly classified and denied. This particular document also contains
information identifying an Agency staff employee and Agency internal filing
instructions. The document was therefore denied under the authority of
exemptions (b) (1), (b) (2) and (b) (3).

1. A review of the Lee Harvey OSWALD file (201-289248)
has been completed by the Mexican Branch in connection with
reference Freedom of Information request. Most of the
information contained in the file that pertains to Mexico
came from sensitive sources and methods, such as photo
surveillance, bilateral tetap and mail intercept
operations. 24 Although the mail intercept and photo
surveillance activities have been dicontinued, the fact
that they were in operation in Mexico continues to be
considered sensitive. The bilateral teltap is still IP/EDI
active, and, therefore, is sensitive.

FOR FILING
a. Sylvia DURAN Tirado. A Mexican female
employed by the Cuban Embassy in Mexico who provided पा
assistance to OSWALD in his attempts to obtain a Cuba
visa. Information regarding DURAN appears in the Warren
Report, however, it is not attributed to the Agency.
The Government of Mexico (GOM) did arrest and interrogate
DURAN re her connection with OSWALD, and a copy of the
GOM deposition appears in the Report. The deposition was
turned over to the Commission by the GOM via State Department.
Since knowledge of DURAN's contact with OSWALD originally
came to both the GOM's and Agency's attention via the
24 bilateral teltap, all mention of Agency knowledge or
participation in DURAN's arrest and subsequent interrogation
has been marked for non-release.
b. Photo of unidentified man (taken in front of
the Soviet Embassy in Mexico. This photo was taken by
Station Mexico photo surveillance of the Soviet Embassy
during the month of October 1963. When news of the
arrest of OSWALD as Kennedy's assassin became known,
the Station immediately forwarded copies of the photo
to the FBI in the mistaken assumption that the photo
was of OSWALD taken while he was in Mexico that fall.
It was later determined that the photo was not of OSWALD
and in fact had been taken after he had departed Mexico.
(OSWALD was in Mexico from 26 September thru 3 October 1963.)
Even though the photo was not of OSWALD it had been shown
to OSWALD's wife and mother, with the background partially

cropped in an effort to disguise the place where the
photo had been taken. The photo became somewhat of an
issue when the Warren Commission decided it belonged
in the Report as part of the exhibits since it had been
shown to the OSWALDS. The Agency finally allowed the
picture to appear in the report with the background
completely blocked out and with the agreement that no
mention would be made about where it had been taken.
As far as can be determined, the Agency has never
admitted publicly that the photo was taken in Mexico,
even though there has been a great deal of speculation
to that effect by several authors and journalists. As
a matter of fact, one of the lawyers who worked with the
Commission later leaked information to an author regarding
the photo, but erroneously said it had been taken in
front of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico by CIA Still,
the Agency has not revealed the actual location, only
saying it was taken somewhere outside the U.S. All
mention of the photo has therefore been marked to be
withheld, because of sensitive sources and methods
involved.
c. Gilberto ALVARADO Ugarte. ALVARADO, a
Nicaraguan citizen, walked in to the U.S. Embassy in
Mexico, claiming to have knowledge re Kennedy's assasination
It was learned that ALVARADO was an agent for the Nicaraguan
Intelligence Service (NIS), however his story re the
assassination was separate from his work for the NIS) After
lengthy interrogation, including a polygraph, it was
determined that ALVARADO had been fabricating a story claiming
he had seen OSWALD receive money from a Cuban official at
the Cuban Embassy in Mexico. The ALVARADO story appears
in the Warren Report but it does not reveal his identity.
In
order to continue to protect ALVARADO and the Nicaraguan
government from possible embarrassment all mention of
ALVARADO has been marked for non-release.
2.5 A list and copies of douments from the OSWALD file
have been forwarded to your office for review by other(LA)
branches and possibly other Divisions. The documents are marked
according to which volume they belong in the 201 file (there
are 57 volumes plus many bulky atachments.)
3. During the review, it was necessary several times to
refer to the Warren Report and the exhibits to ascertain
exactly what was already known about the Mexican aspect of the
case. It is doubtful that the other branches will find this
necessary, but in case they do, the Warren Report is held
in the Library.
