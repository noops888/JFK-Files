ACTION Item - Assassination Review Board
During discussions with Kathy Dyer today, I learned that the JFK Assassination Review Board will want to
meet with us. The purpose of the meeting will be to discuss records your offices had/have from the 1958 -
1965 time period. They will be interested in specific files from the O/DCI, the IG, the OGC, and
"Legislative Affairs." Dee: Were the "Legislative Affairs" records transferred to the Office of
Congressional Affairs?
Before we meet with them, Kathy will arrange a meeting with Barry Harrelson, CSI, who has been working
with the Board members. The purpose of this meeting will be to identify specific areas the Board is
interested in, what DCI records they may have already seen, etc., so we can prepare for the meeting with
the Board

MEMORANDUM FOR DCI/IRO
THRU:
DATE:
SUBJECT:
FROM:
C/DCI/ER
BR
April/May 1997
Proposed Topics/Questions for DCI Office Briefings to ARRB
DC/DCI/ER
ACTION TAKEN: Since documents in this timeframe were not logged into a searchable
system, AARC keyword and visual shelf list searchs were utilized. Executive Registry has
identified seven (7) shelf lists containing documents during the referenced timeframe (60's
to mid-70's):
80M01009A
80M01048A
80R01284A
80B01285A
80R01580R
80B01676R
80R01731R.
Each question was treated as a separate search effort with appropriate keyword and
AARC shelf list searches/reviews. Due to the timeframe, many of the applicable boxes are
being utilized by historians at the present time (shelf lists are annotated accordingly). As
of 30 April thrity-three (33) boxes of documents have been recalled/reviewed.
Question 1: How are the records of the DCI, DDCI and the heads of the directorates
indexed?
Answer 1: The records which pass through Executive Registry are incorporated into our
subject/topic files. Front Office working files which are turned over to the registry as a
DCI/DDCI/EXDIR leaves the position are categorized by material type; i.e.,
calendars/cards, meetings, trips, chronos, etc. High level weekly meetings are
categorized by agency name: NSC, STATE, DEFENSE, ATTORNEY GENERAL, etc.
Question 2: In a Cold Warrior footnote, Tom Mangold reports that as any of CI Staff
Chief James Angleton's files were destroyed, "a complete record was carefully maintained
about what had been done. (George) Kalaris signed off on every file and the DCI's office
was notified. (p. 143) What records would the DCI's office have maintained on this
destruction?
GD
13-00000
Answer 2: The keywords ANGLETON & KALARIS were utilized in this search; plus
through the perusal of shelflists a folder with DOCUMENT DESTRUCTION was
reviewed. The folder with "destruction" in the title contained paramaters set for
retention of documents during the various investigations/committees. None of the reviews
surfaced any authorization or reference to or listing of Angleton documents being
destroyed. If the timeframe for the said destruction were provided and the position held
by Kalaris were known, the appropriate DCI Chronos and position liaison files could be
searched.
Question 3: Which office controls the unredacted version of the Family Jewels memo?
Answer 3: Executive Registry shelf lists record two (2) retired boxes containing material
identifiable as "Family Jewels". At the present time those two boxes are being utilized
by the DCIIIRO for the Levy search. (79M01476A; boxes 16 & 17). One of the testimony
documents located in a folder titled "White House Correpsondence re: Congressional
Investigations" referenced the "Family Jewels". Per a conversation with DCI/IRO on
30 April 1997, the GC has found the unredacted version.
Question 4: What records would be kept of requests to or liaison between the Agency
and NSA or FBI in the wake of the assassination (November 23, 1963-September 30,
1964?
Answer 4: The shelf lists for the above timeframe did not indicate high level meetings
with either of the two agencies, therefore, the NSA and FBI liaison folders for 1963/1964
were reviewed. There were no responsive documents in these compartments. The
McCone files are under review by David Borage.
Question 5: What records would be kept of DCI tasking to other intelligence community
agencies in the immediate wake of the assassination (the first month)?
Answer 5: No memos re Kennedy were found in DDCI/Walters files for 1963/64. The
DCI/IRO has tasked this out through the CMS/IMO. The DCI/McCone files are under
review by David Borage.
Question 6: Where are the personal and working papers of the DCI, DDCI, and the heads
of the directorates? (Personal files, soft files, and official files are included in this request.)
Answer 6: During the early retirement years AOIDCI did retire a number of soft files.
Some DCI files contained records labeled as "Personal". Executive Registry holdings of
personal correspondence would be maintained as temporary to be retained within the
registry for three years then destroyed. No Official Files were noted on shelf lists.
Question 7: Are there any Agency records on George Herbert Walker Bush prior to his
appointment as DCI?
13-00000
Answer 7: Bush was appointed as DCI on 3 November 1975. Earlier Career:
1974-1975, Chief, U.S. Liaison Office, People's Republic of China
- 1973-1974, Chairman, Republican National Committee
- 1971-1972, Ambassador to the United Nations
1967-1971, Member of Congress, 7th District, Texas
Servid in World War II as naval naviator in the Pacific.
BUSH was run as a keyword and no documents revealed evidence of any correspondence
prior to his appointment as DCI. Navy liaison files from 1963-66 were reviewed with no
responsive documents.
Question 8: What records might still exist on correspondence between the DCI (Helms)
and the Nixon White House on the 1967 IG Report? on the Bay of Pigs? on the
assassination?
Answer 8: Helms was DCI from 30 June 1966 through 2 February 1973. The Bay of
Pigs material is presently under review at the History Staff. The tasking memo from the
DCI to the DD's stating that the CIA will not involve itself in assassinations. The
DCI/IRO stated that she has the "1967 IG Report". The Helms files were recalled by
Chris Burgess for Helms use.
Question 9: How are White House requests recorded. What records might there be of
requests from the then Attorney General Robert Kennedy?
Answer 9: White House requests would initially be filed in Liaison with the White House
for the year that the request was received. It might also be transferred to or cross-
referenced to a topic file if significance warrented it. (The Kennedy was Attorney
General from 1961-1964.) Attorney General labeled folders were recalled and reviewed.
The following correspondence from Attorney General Robert Kennedy resides in
Executive Registry files:
Memo to Heads of Departments and Agencies re NSA Memorandum 161 ensuring the
development of plans, programs & action proposals to protect internal security.
BROSS
Memo of acknowledgement of the appointment of John A. Ross as Deputy for National
Intelligence Programs.
- Proposed Revision of NSC-5427 re restructing Soviet Diplomat access to U.S. Strategic
Intelligence.
Our response to a verbal request for information re the Cuban refugee situation in
Maini.
Verbal & Paper requests re NIE on Weapons of Mass Destruction.
13-00000
- Query re interrogation of members of 2506 Brigade in Miami by Dept. of the Army
- Memo of accolade for the efforts of Mike Kiskowsky in the Cuban Rescue Effort
- Section 7 alien residence request.
Our notification of Swiss/Soviet confrontation of Nosenko at the Washington District
Office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service w/CIA present plus appreciation for
Commissioner Farrell & stuffs assistance in the above effort.
Question 10: How are records kept of presidential briefings from the CIA (either the
DCI's office or one of the directorates)? What DCI briefing papers still exist for the
period August 1, 1963 to February 1, 1964?
Answer 10:
If the ODCI briefed the Office of the President, then there would be a briefing book with
any background material and notes in the folders retired for that DCI's term.
If the briefing were to be given by another directorate, it should have been filed on a
temporary basis within the ER files and not retired.
The following briefing books during that timeframe were located in our records:
1DEC63 - Key Elements of Soviet Military & Economic Strengths
(1284A/10)
DCI (McCone) Meetings with the President (Johnson) 3 folders
(1285A/5-6).
Question 11: What records might still exist on any McCone requests for information from
the directorates following the assassination? For example, any request on the surveillance
from the Mexico City Station during LHO's visit.
Answer 11: Warren Commission folder holds a document to David Berlin/EXDIR/WC
stating that Mexico City Station did take photographs. Hill briefing on Oswald indicating
that we were not surveilling him at the time of his visit to Mexico City. The McCone files
have recently been recalled by history staff. Thus far in the efforts of this search, I have
not located any reference to DCI taskings to the directorates.
Question 12: Who were the Agency liaisons with Robert Kennedy prior to and after the
assassination?
Answer 12: I saw no reference to Agency liaisons in the files searched.
13-00000
Question 13: What records still exist of communications between DCI McCone and
Allen Dulles during the Warren Commission:
Answer 13: Dulles served on the Warren Commission from 1963-64, and McCone was
DCI from 1961-65. In scanning the correspondence, it appears that the memos were from
the Commission to the Agency, not person to person.
Question 14: What records might still exist of communications between Allen Dulles and
anyone at CIA during the Warren Commission?
Answer 14: We hold Warren Commission material from 1963-1975. Dulles served on
the Warren Commission from 1963-1964. In scanning the correspondence, it appears
that the memos were from the Commission to the Agency, not person to person.
Question 15: Did CIA have anyone on the Warren Commission staff (either an Agency
officer of a source)?
Answer 15: I did not see any staffing lists for the Warren Commission.
Question 16: What records exist in the Executive Registery on Operation Mongoose or
the Special Group Augmented?
Answer 16: The Executive registry holds one file folder titled "MONGOOSE Cuban
Reconnaissance/Overflights" dated September 9, 1962 through May 31, 1963. The box
containing this folder has been signed out by history staff (Diane/Jim) since February 27,
1996. Within the Rockefeller Committee folders, (1048A/9) I found a document from OSD
requesting that all documents in the CIA pertaining to Operation Mongoose be transferred
to the officer currently responsible for the operations covering Cuba (dated 28JAN63)
plus a package of MONGOOSE Meeting MFR's and background documentation
requested by the IG in Nov 1975.
Question 17: What records might still exist of conversations or communications between
the DCI and CI Staff Chief James Angleton on Nosenko?
Answer 17: Seven (7) folders have been identified as holding Nosenko material. The
following records of information re Nosenko between the DCI and C/CI residing in
Executive Registry files are as follows:

*
Note: Next step would be to isolate the Directors' Chronos (69-71), recall & review for
possible notes or MFR's which might have been maintained in the Chronos vice the
project files.
Note: A memo notation indicates that George Kalaris was C/CI in 1976.
