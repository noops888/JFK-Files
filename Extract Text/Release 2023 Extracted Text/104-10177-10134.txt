Change Due to his absence from
15 July to
15 October 1950, all payments during this period should
be suspended. Payment should be made however for half
of the month of July 1950, due to the overlap of 15 days
in July in which he assisted FULAR in taking over all
the agents.
Future operational duty reports submitted on the first of each month will
reflect the above changes.
