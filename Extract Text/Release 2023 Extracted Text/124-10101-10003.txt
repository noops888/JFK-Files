process of attempting to rendezvous with unidentified Cubans
with whom he planned to travel to Cuba to collect funds to
be used in the overthrow of the Jamaican Government. Such
funds were to be used to send organized groups of Jamaicans
to Cuba for training for this purpose. Evans claimed to be
working with a "syndicate" in the United States which is
to finance a communist revolution in Jamaica. He claimed
this is the same syndicate" which in the United States
had caused Jack Ruby to kill Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassin
of President Kennedy. Evans further claimed to be enlisting
aid of Jamaican criminal element to organize an extortion
racket to shake down some 100 off-track betting shops in
Jamaica, proceeds from which were to be used in revolution
