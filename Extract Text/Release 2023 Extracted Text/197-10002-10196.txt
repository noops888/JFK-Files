WITH THE WHITE FLAG COMMUNISTS. THERE MAY HAVE BEEN
SOME ENCOURAGEMENT OR REASSURANCE FROM THE USSR,

BURMESE GOVERNMENT TO TRY TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH
SAW HUNTER AND THE MORE MODERATE INSURGENTS. IF THESE
TALKS FAIL, GENERAL NE WIN WILL BE FACED WITH AN

19 NOV IT WAS DECIDED TO DISPENSE IMMEDIATELY
WITH ALL US AID. THIS DECISION FOLLOWED A LONG
INTERROGATION OF TWO MEMBERS OF THE KHMER SERE I

ACTIVITIES AND BROADCASTS. IN FACT THEIR
ANSWERS SEEM TO SHOW NO MORE THAN THAT US ARMS AND
EQUIPMENT ARE PLENTIFUL IN SOUTH VIETNAM, THAT THE
KHMER SEREI HAD RECEIVED AMERICAN ASSISTANCE TO FIGHT
THE VIET CONG AND ALSO AMERICAN RADIO APPARATUS.
