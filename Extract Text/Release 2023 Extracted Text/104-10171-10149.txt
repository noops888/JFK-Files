AN APPEAL TO HUMANITY
BY DAVID ROUSSET
(abridged from the French publication Le Figaro Litteraire)
14-00000
I address this appeal to the conscience of all free men.
During the last five years there have been increasing numbers
of reports on the Soviet system of concentration camps. The war,
which opened the Nazi comps to the world and then destroyed
them, also broke the silence which concealed Russia's remote terri-
sones. Under the pirssures of the war and its aftermath, non-Pussian
nationals, after being deported into Russia by the thousands, were
then freed. As these victims escaped to the West, ahorrible land-
icope of concentration camps was unveiled.
Sources of information in regard to the Russian concentration
camp system are widely varied. They come from every nationality
Poles of every political complexion, even communist; from Ger-
mans, Jews, Central Europeens, Spaniards; and from Russians, in-
cluding former MVD officials. Even the Soviet legel texts them-
selves attest to this horror. All this cannot be a conspiracy: The
number of documented reports and their insistence do not permit
us to reject them without a hearing.
Vishunsky tells us there are correction camps where men nie.
habilitated through labor. Not so many years ago Gestapo Chief
Momenter posted above the infamous Sachsenhousen camp the
slogan "Joy through Work."
The Soviet code of corrective labor was recently published
abrced. I will quote only two parts. Section 129 recalls that in
October, 1943, "institutions for corrective labor were transferred
from the Ministries of Justice to the NKVD (now MVD) of the
U.S.S.P." It is an ill omen when the highest police organization
of a government takes charge of the reeducation of its citizens.
Section & states: "Those persons are sent to correctional labor.
comps who have been condemned by (a) a sentence passed by a
tribunal; (b) o decree of an administrative body." There is
uble misinterpretation; the law recognizes and approves deporta-
on without trial.
The stone buildings of Buchenwald, built to last, gave that
pson city the aura of eternity. The same feeling grips you when
are used, with iron tubes through the flooring for toilets, tiers of
wooden bunks, and sentry stations connected by telephone to the
Commandant's car. These small new details are alarming, for they
indicate a special kind of calculation, necessary only in the case
of permanent institutions.
The camps make the police an imposing social power within the
State, a well defended master of manpower. Their central adminis-
tration, the Gulag, is one of the largest economic trusts of the
J.S.S.R. Contracts are prepared on the basis of the prevailing
wage rates, but since deportee labor costs far less, the difference
is absorbed by the police "corporation." Here again the inmate
of the concentration camp supports his guardian. The Nazi SS
reached this state only at the very last stages of its existence. In
this sense the world of the concentration camp develops like a
cancer within society, corrupting the executioner along with the
victim.
A CALL TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
We are laced with an international crime and we must
say so as clearly as possible. Our allies in the struggle for
freedom are being systematically exterminated. It is our
duty to support the demand of Me Psusset for an investiga-
tion of the Soviet concentration camps. So long as the Rus-
sian concentration camp system exists, hundreds of thousands
Out of the cacophony of the thousands of documented reports,
the "concentration camp man" emerges. He is nightmarishly
typical. He is hungry, sick and afraid. He lives in wooden bar-
racks, or under a tent, or in earth caves. His fate is locked be-
tween barbed wire barricades, beneath observation towers. Under
constant threat of dogs and rifles, he works far beyond the power
of his muscles. Given.neither the means nor time to wash, he wears
foul rags. He is awakened before dawn; at night, having returned
exhausted from work, he stands in an interminable line, near a hos-
pital lacking medicaments. In the middle of the night, in every
kind of weather, he is aroused by blows to unload freight cars. This
is a faithful condensation of hundreds of reports and thousands
of such reports exist.
The world of the concentration comp keeps growing. Yester-
day the Soviet Union had only political detention camps. The
cruel civil war of the collectivization period started her on this en-
terprise of forced labor which plays its part in every economic sec-
tor, including scientific research. The present network of camps
spreads across Siberia to the White Sea and the Baltic, from the
very outskirts of Leningrad and Moscow to Baku.
During nearly their entire existence, the Nazi camps were bu-
one apocalyptic aspect of a general pathological pattern. Only
during the last years did they become an integral part of a society
founded on a new type of human exploitation. In Russia this devel-
opnient is entirely completed. The class that-organizes the camps
is not threatened with extinction. It is in possession of all powe-
and firmly resolved to carve out its future. These camps are thus
an expression of normal relations, the natural development of a
new type of society. And it is this unique quality of the Sovie-
system of concentration camps which fills us with such horror.
Imagine the mass graves of the old Buchenwald erupting with
a resurrection of their dead, delegates of a protesting humanit-
united on the great square under the flares and in the snow, listen-
ing to the drumbeats and waiting to be counted. How would the
judge the safe, comfortable, intelligent citizens of the West whe
heard these new cries of terrar and did nothing to answer?. The
strongest obscenities would be too weak. Millions of men toda-
suffer horribly, with no hope.
I do not ask the world to state, "Concentration camps exist in
Russia." Some might reply, "Our information is insufficient to pro-
nounce such a serious verdict." I only ask you to sa;"
must be opened."
So that the file may be opened, I now propose the establish-
14-00000
THESE ARE THE FACTS:
Within the Soviet sphere, a system of concentration
camps exists, rivaling in extent and horror those of Nazi
Germany. President Truman has stated, on the best au-
thority available to him, that the Russians hold 16 million
hopeleas human beings in these camps.
On the basis of thousands of documented reports from
escapees from behind the Iron Curtain, the distinguished
French writer, David Rousset, issued his appeal to human-
ity, reprinted in abridged form above, for an investigation:
into the Soviet concentration camp system.
Mr. Rousset's demand deserves the fullest attention
of the American people. We of the Iron Curtain Refugee
Campaign have therefore undertaken to make these facts
known as a public service. We will not keep silent before
this monstrous international crime, now driving thousands
of human beings, destitute, through the Iron Curtain. Nor
shall we abandon those who flee the Soviet terror.
Therefore we call on the American people
(1) To join with Mr. Rousset in demanding an impartial
investigation of the Soviet concentration camp system.
(2) To support the Iron Curtain Refugee Campaign so that
cach victim of this inhuman system fleeing to the West
can be assured of help by those who are dedicated to
the cause of human freedom and decency.
A statement from some survivors of Stalin's
Concentration Camps
The comp's where we spent many years of our lives continue to be
ignored by the peoples of the world; we have escaped but millions
of other human beings still fill them. Since they came into being, the
Soviet comps have ewillowed swillo more people, have have exacted more victims
thew all other concentration comps-Hitler's included; and this In-
human system continues to operate unchecked.

EMERGENCY APPEAL
TO THE FREE WORLD
A GREAT HUMAN TRAGEDY CONFRONTS THE FREE WORLD. RELIEF AND RESETTLEMENT FOR
ALL THOSE ESCAPEES FROM COMMUNIST-DOMINATED EASTERN EUROPE NOW AIDED BY THE IRON
CURTAIN REFUGEE CAMPAIGN OF THE INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE WILL END BY MAY
20. 1952, UNLESS ADDITIONAL FUNDS BECOME AVAILABLE. THIS TRAGEDY THREATENS MANY OF
THE ADDITIONAL THOUSANDS OF MEN AND WOMEN WHO WILL ESCAPE FROM BEHIND THE IRON
CURTAIN WITHIN THE NEXT MONTHS.
Twelve IRC offices in Europe are overwhelmed by appeals for assistance from escapees who cross the Iron Curtain
barriers into Western Europe at the rate of 1.000 per month.
Dr. Floyd Black. American President of Roberts College at Istanbul, who headsour Turkish committee, reports
that Pulgadan anti-Communist escapees cannot secure work permits in Turkey. These refugees are almost entirely
dependent upon us for support, although the Turkish Red Crescent is cooperating.
493 refugees from Iron Cortain countries-professionals, technicians, resistance leaders-and their families,
with assurance or visas for the United Statedor Canada, will need occan transportation and resettlement aid.
Many Iron Curtain refugees at present with their families in the United States are awaiting job placements and
mirst be supported by the International Rescue Committee.
On Monday, March 21. President Truman issued a directive allocating $4,300,000 for assistance to Iron Cur-
tain Refugees. In his statement. Mr. Truman underscored the unique importance of the problem of the Iron Curtain
Refugees from the standpoint of our national security. The President accurately stated the case:
"The miserable condition in which these refugees from Communism find theniselves and their present
inability to emigrate to new homes and start new lives, lead inevitably to despair. Their disillusioument
is being effectively exploited by Communist propaganda. These men and women are friends of freedom.
They include able and courageous fighters against Communism. They ask only for an opportunity to
play a useful role in the fight against Communism. It is the responsibility of the free world to afford them
this opportunity."
This money is not yet being used beranse the machinery of government grinds slowly. Meanwhile brave men and
women who ri-ked their lives to escape from Communist tyranny are in danger of being abandoned to their fate.
Private relief is the only available channel of American help. The American government program is
organized.
Government funds, when available, will help solve part of the problem. But this aid roust be supplemented by the
specialized endeavors of American voluntary agencies. Counselling, orientation, processing for migration, supple-
mental relief and medical attention-these are things that the refugee must have. From a psychological standpoint,
this personalized assistance is of the greatest importance because it convinces him that he is wanted, that the Western
world cares about his fate.
lithes man beings are abandoned, we the ive point to the editorial comment of The New York Times:
"Far too many, after interrogation, have been cast on the ash hear as thanks for the fantastic int-
REFUGEE LEADERS PLEA
We, the undersigned representatives of the European peoples subju-
gated by Communist tyranny, urgently appeal for support for the Iron.
Curtain Refugee Campaign of the International Rescue Committee in
its present emergency.
The nature of the escapee's first contact with the Western world is
of the greatest importance. Ordinarily he reaches the free side of the
Iron Curtain completely without means and emotionally and physi-
cally exhausted from his harrowing ordeal. Although he may be kont-
alive in over-crowded camps, all too froquantly he experiences ari-
almost total personal Indifference that embitters even the strongest
soul.
It is hardly possible to exaggerate the value of the service which
the International Rescue Committee has randerad to those who have
succeeded in escaping from behind the Iron Curtain and to those who
have suffered and continue to suffer in the fight for freedom and
democracy.
The promptness with which the International Rescue Committee
has come to the assistance of those who have escaped, and the
warmth and understanding displayed by its representatives have
been a source of great spiritual encouragement for the refugees in
Europe. It has demonstrated to them that on their way to freedom they
have not been abandoned to their fate. It has confirmed their faith in
democracy to the point where subsequent hardships could not destroy
it. It has proved to the world that the right of asylum is not a mere
formality devoid of human content. It has helped to keep clive hopo
for tomorrow in the breasts of all peoples who are today enslaved
by Communist tyranny.
It would be a catastrophe of the first order if this vital work were to
come to an end for lack of funds. The hardships of the refugeas would
be increased many fold: and the Communist propagandists would
gloat over the fact in many editorials and radio broadcasts.

MEMORANDUM FOR: THE RECORD
SUBJECT:
Contact with Abran Becker, International
Rescue Committee (IRC)
27 August 1952
1. At the request of Mr. O'Gara and C/10, the understoned
this date listened to a presentation concerning the financial needs
of the C. This matter was reviewed by ar. Becker, the current
Executive Director of IRC and successor to David Martin.
2. In brief, the IRC must obtain $50,000 immediately if it
is to continuo in being. A considerably larger sum will be required
if operations of any magnitude are undertaken.
3. tr. Becker reviowed the IEC's unsuccessful attempts to
obtain money through public appeals and pranta from private founda-
tione. He underlined the fact that the IRC has been particularly
unprepared for a refusal from the Ford Foundation, which last your
granted IRC $500,000 to assist in the resettlement of intellectuals
from the Soviet orbit.
4. Mr. Becker expressed disappointment in procedures being
employed by the Department of State in connection with the special
U.S. program for assistance to "Iron Curtain" refugees, using
4.3 million in Mutual Security Act funds. In becker's opinion, the
Department will commit almost all the funds through FICUME
(Provisional Intor-governmental Committee for the Hovement of
Migrants from Europe) and for the "Big Four" refugee-aid groups
associated with religious organizations. Becker stated that the
IRC is not overlooking any possibility of participating in the U.S.
program in even a small way and has in fact submitted four projects
to State for approval. These projects cover such problems as the
provision for special diet for refugees at Camp Valka (Germany) who
have TB. It was clear that Becker held out little hope that IRC's
financial needs can be met by joining the U.S. program administered
by State.
5. This agency's appreciation of the refugee problem and sympathy
for efforts to meet it were indicated, but Mr. Becker was not encouraged to
hope that fards for IRC could be obtained from CIA.
