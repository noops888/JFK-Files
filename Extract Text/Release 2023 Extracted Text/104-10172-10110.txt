1. After receipt of the referenced dispatch ODENVY was queried by
Headquarters as to whether or not it wished to continue receiving copies of
HALPERIN's correspondance which appeared to concern only family matters.
The following reply was received:
"(ODENVY) would appreciate receiving copies of letters
addressed to (HALPARIN) even though the letters appear to
relate to purely family matters. In reviewing such corres-
pondance in the past, we have noted information of value,
particularly with respect to future plans of the HALPERINS."
2. It is therefore requested that the field continue to forward
photographic copies of all correspondence concerning HALPERIN or other
American Communists in Mexico.

1. The attached negatives are of three letters which were addressed
to Maurice HALPERIN in Mexico City.
2. The first two letters are of Robert ROGERS from Hume, Virginia.
One letter concerns queries re effects to be shipped when the ROGERS family
comes as immigrants to Mexico. Evidently their papers for
Mexico are being arranged by a lawyer named FANTHAUSEN in Mexico. Definite
identification of FANTHAUSEN is not possible from this as there are two
brothers here in Mexico who are practicing lawyers and either of them
might be the one responsible for arranging the papers for ROGERS. ROGERS
made the statement in the letter of 2 September that "As a matter of fact,
we have to come anyway, and we'll enter as tourists if we can't get ready
as immigrants." The second communication from ROGERS was a request for
a Post Office box to which his mail could be sent in Mexico.
3. The third letter is from Jane Constance ROGERS, Robert's mother,
and was sent from Mill Valley, California. She had previously asked
HALPERIN to look for an apartment for her for the winter. In her letter
Jane Constance mentions the fact that Morton SOBELL is no longer in
Alcatraz. She also refers to two "youngish" lawyers from Los Angeles
who came to San Francisco for a breath of "fresh air". She was aware
of the presence of Albert MALTZ family in southern California also.
4. ODENVY, locally, has been provided with copies of the attachments.

speech was published. HALPERIN, I believe, is of English-
Jewish background. He still has a con in the U.S. and was
happily anticipating a visit from the son in 1961. The son
canceled the trip for unspecified reasons and HALPERIN bo-
cans extremely depressed. HALPERIN mentioned on a mumber of
occasions that he would like to come back to the U.S. and
at one tire asked me if he should accept a position in Cube
which had bean offered to him by Paure Caicos. I believe
he has regretted his going to the USSE. He is always
