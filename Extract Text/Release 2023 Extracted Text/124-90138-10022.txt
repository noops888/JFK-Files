1. When Felix Munoz Cardenas, Third-Class Auxiliary Assistant of the Cuban
Consulate in Kingston, Jamaica, returned to Kingston on 28 May 1962 from
a recent trip to Cuba, he brought with him a considerable quantity of
Cuban propaganda in English.1 Mnoz was met at the Palisadoes Airport.
by Alfonso Herrera Perdomo, the uban Consul; Gerardo Sanchez Robert,
the Cuban Commercial Attache; and Richard Hart, a well-known Jamaican
Communist. Some of the printed matter brought in by Munoz was detained
for inspection by the Jamaican customs officials, who made an effort
to check the baggage of Munoz and two other Cuban diplomats, Agustin
Yassels Gonzalez and Guillermo Salgado Alvarez, who had arrived on the
plane with Munoz.2 Both Herrera and Sanchez stubbornly resisted a
baggage search and none was carried out. The publications and other
materials were released to Herrera on 1 June.
2. The publications brought into Jamaica by Munoz, consisted of an estimated
30 to 40 copies each of sixteen different books and magazines. All were
in English and had been prepared in Cuba by or on behalf of the Cuban
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The titles are as follows:
"And Havana Woke Up Under the Imperialist Air Attack"
(speech by Fidel Castro)
"Committed to Our Own Principles"
"Cuba at Punta del Este"
"The Role of Foreign Aid in the Development of Cuba"
(Economic lectures by Major Ernesto Che Guevara)
"A Journey of Peace and Solidarity" (Dr. Osvaldo Dorticos)
"History Will Absolve Me" (Fidel Castro)
