THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION. SOURCE GRADINGS ARE DEFINITIVE. APPRAISAL OF CONTENT IS TENTATIVE
SOURCE An official British service from "a regular source, quoting Jovan Miric,
correspondent in Cuba for TANJUG, Yugoslav press agency. Appraisal
of Contents 3.
1. The Soviet Union has clearly accepted Fidel Castro as the leader of the
Cuban revolution, since in any case there is no one else, and apparently
also as a sincere Marxist-Leninist. However, the Soviets and other foreign
Communists resent the revolutionary arrogance of Castro, who has admitted
to having read only 370 pages of Das Kapital, which he says he may study
more when he has time.
2. The change of the Cuban youth organization's name from Association of
Young Rebels to League of Young Communists is regarded among foreign
Marxists as ridiculous.
3. An illustration of foreign Communists irritation at Cuban arrogance
occurred during a press conference early in May given by two Spanish
Communists in Habana. The Spaniards had said that the Spanish Communist
Party was trying to achieve power by means of strikes and other non-
violent action in order to avoid another civil war. A Cuban journalist
chided them for this statement, and asked scornfully: "Don't you have
mountains?" With some irritation one of the Spaniards replied that, just
as the Cuban revolution had been made in a way quite different from the
many that had preceded it, so the Spanish revolution would be unique,
dependent on conditions inside Spain and on decisions taken by Spaniards
alone.
