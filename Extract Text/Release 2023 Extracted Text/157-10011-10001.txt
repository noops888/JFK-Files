OCCURRENCE:
Meeting of SGA On Operation MONGOOSE, 6 September 1962. Discussion of LANSDALE'S
suggestion #32 (agricultural sabotage). GENERAL CARTER emphasized the extreme
sensitivity of any such operation and the disasterous results that would flow
from something going wrong particularly if there were obvious attribution to
the-U.S.He-went-on-to-say, however, that it would be possible to accomplish
this purpose by methods more subtle than those indicated in the_paper. He men-
tioned specifically the possibility of producing crop failures/by the introduction
of biological agents/which would appear to be of natural origin. BUNDY said that
he had no worries about any such sabotage which could clearly be made to appear
as a result of local Cuban disaffection or a natural disaster, but that we must
avoid external activities such as release of chemicals, etc. unless they could.

With regard to paragraph 2 of Lansdale's memorandum to SGA dated 14 Nov.
1962 Harvey states: "The statement that Operation Mongoose had had no information on
this operation since early October was patently false. Specific references made to the
pen ultimate paragraph and Lansdale's memorandum concerning a report for the CIA which he
used as a basis for memorandum dated 31 Oct. 1962 to Oswald Kirkpatrick. This refers to
-a telephonic_conversation_on the evening of 30 Oct. 1962 between Lansdale and Cresve
which is referred specifically in paragraph 2 on pages 7 and 8 of my reference memorandu.
I have discussed this matter in detail with and clearly recollects that his
conversation with Lansdale on that date took place as reflected in my reference memorandum.
During this conversation there was no discussion of previous operations except a brief
discussion of the COBRA and teams and Lansdale did not ask, according to Cover's
recollection, any specific questions concerning assets inside or prior operations which
SOURCE: would logically have led to the discussions at the time STAFF:
of the Matahambre operation."
