4 November 1964
MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH/CA/CI
ATTENTION: Mr. B. Hidalgo
SUBJECT: Return of (Ecuadorean) Passport for ANUG-1, AB Case 4933-A.

1. Attached is AMUC-1's (Ecuadorean) ordinary passport No. (19406)

2. There are several points in connection with the validity of this
document which should be called to your attention. The passport will expire
7 February 1965. If it is used for re-entry into the United States within
six months of the date of expiration (i.e., any time between now and
7 February 1965), the bearer would normally be advised by the admitting
U.S. Immigration officer that the passport is in need of revalidation.

3. The Form I-94 which bearer received at the time of entry into the
U.S. on 4 October 1964 authorizes stay to 3 November 1964. For additional
travel out of the U.S. it would have to be extended.

4. In view of the approaching expiration of this passport, it is
suggested that Subject be issued a new operational passport for his future
use. Please advise us of your wishes in this matter.
