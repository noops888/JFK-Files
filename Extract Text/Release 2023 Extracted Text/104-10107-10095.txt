(Thomas
Roberts) The Itkin Case
Thomas Lee Roberts
1. At our meeting on 30 January 1969, certain additional questions were
raised relative to the relationship between (Roberts) and Itkin.

03
First, when did (LIGLOBE become aware that Itkin and the
103
Conestoga Group had approached (Roberts with a proposal to represent
them in Africa? We were advised in 1966 through case officer
meetings with (Roberts that he had been developing some potential
cover company business with interests from the United States and
England. We were given the name of the (Conestoga Group) no later
than 27 October 1966. We cannot say that we then knew the
individual names of those involved. It was not uncommon for
03 (Roberts to have discussions with a number of potential clients;
when it became apparent' that no real business was forthcoming
from this group, our interest ceased.
At the 30 January meeting, we were also asked certain
questions about (Roberts financial involvement with the law firm
he and Itkin has been with prior to (Robert's) association with
the Agency.

2. We can add nothing to Roberts) account of January 1968 reflecting
that he entered into an agreement with the firm on 31 May 1961 wherein he was
authorized leave of absence from 1 June 1961 to 31 May 1963 drawing $100.00
per week for that period.
