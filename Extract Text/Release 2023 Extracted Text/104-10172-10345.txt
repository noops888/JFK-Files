2. TACC Teenid that Gregory Ye $00Lte had just called it and asked him to
lunch, but since 7/1 was seeing the undersigned, be had to postions the sertleg with
GOLUB. GOLUB had paid on the phone that he was leaving for venation (presumably
in the Soviet Union) on the 15th of Ame. TACCIAR ves to meet CCLUB one hour 01
aftar ve left him, that is, at 1500 hours. Then TACC ETZ 27 mentioned this, we
suggested to him that he ask O0LUB shout the executions in Hungary, bo/A01 bot
replied that the question is a little bit to delicate for his to put to C01.08.
Although we saked FACC D how long GOLUB would be gone, said he did not know
but would try to find out. In reference to your sild concern regarding
Zrelations with COLUB (C72349, 17 February 1958), we have occasionally rυρεοείοί
replies and corrents designed to karass OOLER, but almost without sweption
01 VACCINE has turned ther down as inappropriate, just as he did on the above

suggestion re hungary. We would say that VACC DIRA is not quite the honest abe 01
that we have perhape led Readquarters to believe in the past. He is deceiving. in
his apparent openness and frankness, but we bave noticed that he is also capable
of being quite clever and sly when the occasion drounds. If we have given the
impression that he is simple-minded, we would like to correct that impuseion. Any
person that bas sanaged to hold the job that he has for the second longest period
of any man in the 30-year history of the TICC IKE organisation bas to bave more
then a
simple cop copa grasp of the job, the way, we learned from VaRC IDE/1 that
COLTS is now and has beans for some time an accredited Soviet concal.

Internal Security Folten (presumably M. Alle there, subj.
had been instructor to determina ahat berarity precautions the
Folice of Suolen, Norway and Denmark plan to take to insure the
safety of KHRUSICHEV during his August visit to the Scandinavian
countries. During the conversation, sulid was very critical of his
Soviet colleagues in Stoc, Oslo, & Bope, for their failure to develop
close relat ons with representatives of the Security Folice of those
countries. Subj was worried not only about his own inability to develop
the information requested, but also for the safety of KERUSHCHEV during
this trip. Subj did not know for sure whether K. would visit Finland on
this trip, but believed that if he did, it would occur after the visit to
the other three countries, and that any visit to Finland would be purely
unofficial.
