(JFK)
Carlos Antonio Piad y Del Pino, a Cuban exilę
residing in Washington, D. C., had been interviewed by
representatives of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
in Washington. D. C., on June 6, 1968, relative to a "report",
alleging great discontent in Cuba against Prime Minister
Fidel Castro which he had received. Piad stated that the
"report" wes from a female friend in Cuba whom he declined
to identify, and he said that this "report" was received
in the mail addressed to his wife. Piad also said that he
did not now have this written "report" which was received
from the woman in Cuba. Piad said that he was certain that
there was an apparatus in operation in Cuba which was fighting
Prime Minister Castro, but "reports" were vague and he had no
clear idea of this matter. Piad was of the opinion that
Carlca Tepedino, 37 West 47th Streot, New York City, or Corletto
(phenotic) Jouelry and "el jaco" Robreno in Madrid, Spain, could
throw more light light on the matter.
D.Y
Piad, in a letter to the FBI dated June 6, 1968,
among other things, furnished the following:
"I am totally ignorant of any plans which
Commandante (Faure) chocon (Cuban Minister of
Transports or his friends night have. This is
only something I have been made aware of. Without
being able to furnish anything concretely, I did
wish to bring to the attention of the Department
of State something they ought to know about.
can say that I have friends in the Choon group
and that I understand they have never been
Communists, but I repeat that I have not had
contact with Costaandante Chomo or his friends
up to now. I have had only a report from a
I
female friend from Havana who has knowledge of this matter.

"This is more or less the substance of all that
I wanted to bring to the attention of the Department
of State so that they might know about what appeared
to be a plan aimed at the assassination of Castro,
and that it appeared that Coriandante Chomop and
his friends were involved in it in some way. Also,
I related that although Castro was a closely guarded
man, Chomon was a dangerous man, and I cited the
case of Boumedienne of Algeria whom they tried
recently to assassinate. I explained that from that
I have read Boumedierne is one of the most closely
guarded men in the world other then Castro and that
It is unpredictable what he is going to do."
