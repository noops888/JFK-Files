Dear Mr. Snyder:
I have your note and short resume that you furnished
Mr. Moyer of the State Department.
I appreciate your kindness in offering to be of service
to us on a part-time or other basis. After carefully reviewing
your background against any current or anticipated needs, I
am sorry to advise you that we just have nothing appropriate
to offer you at this time. The opportunities that are now
available are either at the entrance level, in the scientific
or technical field, or clerical areas--the part-time oppor-
tunities are generally available only in clerical work. As
you know, we have been under rigid ceiling restrictions for
about the last year and a half. Therefore, I would be less
than candid if I led you to believe that the situation was
going to change for the better in the near future.
Thank you for getting in touch with us. If an
opportunity of suitable challenge does arise, you can be sure
that we will contact you.
Sincerely,
Robert S. Wattles
Director of Personnel

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, CI Support
SUBJECT:
Richard E. SNYDER
(born 10 Dec. 1919, Passaic, N.J.)
1. You advised me that Robert KENNEDY of OP had called
you, asking about Subject's file (apparently he retired as
a Foreign Service Officer (20 years, age 50) on 30 April
1970; he would like to do some work, on project or part-
time basis). You asked if I knew of any reason why Mr.
BURNES had requested flagging of OP file "to be sure in-
quiries would be referred to CD/Pers for further check with
RI files"
2. Subject is the subject of CS file 201-748009, re-
stricted to CI/R&A (Paul HARTMAN). From the file it is
noted that Subject worked for CIA 27 Mar. 1950-26 Sept.
1950, resigning for personal reasons. The file was restricted
because of involvement with Lee Harvey OSWALD, assassin of
the late President John Kennedy. While Subject was 2nd
Secretary at the US Embassy in Moscow, on 31 Oct. 1959, he
interviewed Lee Harvey OSWALD, when OSWALD appeared at the
US Embassy, stating that he wished to renounce his US
citizenship and become a citizen of the USSR. (My review
shows nothing reflecting adversely on Subject in connection
with that episode) An article in the 28 Feb. 1964 edition
of the Northern Virginia Sun, written by Robert S. ALLEN and
and Paul SCOTT, alleged that "State Department records show
that OSWALD had several meetings with the CIA representative
in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. ... One State Department
cable, No. 234, dated Nov. 2, 1959, reports that OSWALD was
interviewed by the CIA and other embassy officials." In a
memorandum dated 18 March 1964, addressed to Mr. J. Lee
RANKIN, subject "Article Alleging that OSWALD Was Interviewed
by CIA in Moscow", Mr. Richard Helms, then Deputy Director
for Plans, commented on the allegation as follows: "I desire
to state for the record that the allegation carried in this
press report is utterly unfounded as far as CIA is concerned."
SECRET

3. The 201 file reflects that Subject's contacts, in
university circles, included Zbigniew BRZEZINSKI (201-012574),
born ca. 1926 in Poland, who is married to the daughter of
Edward BENES, famous Czech leader. At Agency request, Subject
provided some information on and a personal assessment of
BRZEZINSKI.
4. I do not have personal knowledge relevant to Mr.
BURNES' request, but suggest that DC/CI be queried, in the
event that he might have more background information than I
do.

SECRECY AGREEMENT
HENRY O. FARENDEN
1. I,
, understand that by virtue of my duties in
the
CIA
I may be the recipient of information and
intelligence which concerns the present and future security of the United States
and which belongs to the United States. This information and intelligence,
together with the methods of collecting and handling it, are classified
according to standards set in the State, War, and Navy Departments. I have
read and understand the provisions of the Act of Congress of June 15, 1917
(Espionage Act), as amended, concerning the disclosure of information relating
to the National Defense and I am familiar with the penalties provided for
violation thereof.
2. I agree that I do not now, nor shall I ever possess any right, interest,
title or claim in or to any of the information or intelligence or the methods of
collecting or handling of it which has come or shall come to my attention by
virtue of my connection with the
CIA
but shall always
recognize the property right of the United States of America in and to such
matters.
3. I do solemnly swear that I will never divulge, publish or reveal either
by word, conduct, or by any other means such classified information, intelligence
or knowledge, except in the performance of my official duties and in accordance
with the laws of the United States, unless specifically authorized in writing in
each case by the
CIA
4. I understand that no change in my assignment or employment will relieve
me of my obligation under this oath and that the provisions of this oath will
remain binding upon me even after the termination of my services with the United
States.
5. I understand that my employment by the
CIA
is
conditioned upon my understanding of and strict compliance with "Security
Regulations," and the appendices thereto.
6. I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or
purpose of evasion.
In witness whereof I have set my hand and seal this 9th day of November 1949.
Sworn to before me this 9th day of November 1949.
