ias informaciones quellemn de nuestra Patría aseguran un estado latente
de rebeldía, actividades de sabotages violentos y pasivos, inconformidad en los
lebros de laz er armadas, grandes preocupac os en las esferas del g
bierno y un malestar general en el pueblo cubano.
hay dudas que el Flan do Alpha 66 contribuye en alguna proporción a es
tos fenómenos. Primero anunciamos el desembarco de Vicento Menież antes del 31
de diciembre con otros hambres, apesar de las dificultades conocidas, ce cumplió
en gran medida la prezesa. Murió en el hecho el Capitan Julio Cesar Raziraz.
Sin esperar mucho tiempo, se produjo la gran commoción Mundial ol 17 de Abril
con la presencia y los combatientes del Coronel Vicante Néndez y el myor contin-
Gente que llego a tierras cubanas, deagea de 1961.
En mayo, hombres del Alpha 66 hundieron 2 embarciones cubaras e hicieron 11
prisioneros comunistas, reritiondo otra conmoción Mundial que motivé el escarialo
mayor escenificado por el traidor Fidel Castro y su mayor derreta moral do dos ul-
ticos tiempos. El gran triunfo lo corsigna el pueblo de Cuba en distintos infor
nes que poscemos de muestras células clardestinas.
Otros movimientos positivos de distintas indoles se produjeron, unes con d
to y otros frustados por las autoridades norteamericanas; pero en fin todos destina-
dos a golpear duramente al tirano y alentar y respaldar a los hombres de Lac mon-
tañas y los grupos clandestinos que se juegan todos los dias sus vidas en aras du
la libertad.
Con estos antecedentes de gran valor y valides, azén de mas de 20 acciones co-
mandos y de infiltraciones realizadas por nuestros ma destoendos hombres y por
ura pleyade de patriotas que combatieron y combaten en todos los frentes de accion
cubana, nos sentimos coralmente respaldados para promover un Hamertente en pone-
ral a los cubanos de la Isla a los cubanos del dustierro, a la guerra libertado-
ra. No pretendemos convertirmos en sectaristas, sino que cada cual que capuña el
arma que tenga, la actividad que sea compatible a sus posibilidades, la colabora
ción economica y el apoyo moral, a los que combaten y sobre todo, a los que en la
Isla can la pauta y lleven el mayor peso en la contienda. Sin demora tenemos que
a cometer acciones vitales para que éste gran momento historico ciaje en la libera-
ción definitiva de Cuba.
Ademas de coontirar las cuestiones internes con otros grupos clandestinos,
Alpha 66 esta distrubuyerão cientos de millares de pequeños pantleticos convidan-
do a las milicias, at Ejercito Rebeldo y al pueblo a participar de la contienda en
contra del Castro-Communismo. Todos los cubanos que deseen cooperar a este
ma-
miento pueden pasar por miestras oficiras para entregarles el material que deben
enviar a Cuba. Cada cubano puede servir de puente entre los de dentro y de Suera:
Por último, demandames de todos los cubanos y de las organizaciones que pace
mos de las pal. Cras a los hechos. Que las disputas, las divisionca y las querellas
infecundis se eliminen y se convierta cada uno en un esforzado militante de la
causa cubara. lo requieren los hombres y mujeres quo en las carceles costierea la
gallarta rebeldía racional, los combatientes de todos los frentes y el pueblo en-
clavizado. Iongamos la tragedia de nuestro pueblo por encima de mesquinor intero-
ses y daños cada cubano un impulso y el apoyo moral y muerrero a la epopera ib
tadora. De este modo prezos regresar a nuestra Patria con la frente limpia y el
corazón henchido de orgullo porque supimos conquistar el derecho a cer libres.

ALPHA 66 INFORMA:
Reportes que nos llegan desde nuestras células militantes dentro de Cuba, determinan
que las acciones iniciadas por nuestra Organicación, que er ura de sus etapes cumino
con el desembarcs aul Coronel Vicente Méndez el 17 de Abril en Criente, estan tenien-
do repercusión en otras provincias de la isla.
No es sólo en Oriente donde las fuerzas internas han respondido al estímulo exterior
representado por las acciones de Alpha óó; en Camagüey, por ejemplo, se han produci-
do reiterados brotes de rebeldía traduciaos en sabotajes, resistencia y en algunes
casos enfrentamiento directo con el régimen.
La situación en Oriente, desde luego, es la que revela con mayor claridad la decisión
del pueblo cubano de sacudirse el jugo que lo oprime. A tal extremo que los propios
medios de publicidad del Gobiomo comunista de Cuba han tenido que informar sobre
se debe a "rovi-
"grandes concentraciones de las Fuerzas Armadas", en esos sectores
lizaciones para incrementar la producción", cuando lo cierto es que la fracasada za-
fra de los 10 millones, ya practicamente ha terminado.
Las movilizaciones no han tenido otro objeto, según los reportes que hemos recibido,
que frenar le ola de deserciones que se han venido produciendo en las filas de los
Fuerzas Armadas y cubrir territorios en los cue actúan eficazmente los patriotas cu-
banos.
Que el régimen de Castro está consciente de la pravocad del momento lo demuestra en-
tre otras cosas, la intensa purga que se está llevando a cabo en las mas altas este-
ras del Gobierno, y que comezaron con la cesantia fulminante de José Llause, sono
Kinistro de Educación y Francisco ladron, como ministro de la Industria Azucarera.
Los desplazamientos de distintos elementos de les importantes cargos que venien sou-
pando continúan especialmente en los "Estacos Mayores" de ins Fuercas Armadas, & al
extremo, de que se da por segum la destitución del Comandante Guillermo dareit Frias.
Jefe cel Partido Comunistra en la provincia de Oriente, quien ha caldo en "Desgracia"
debido a su importancia para contener a les invasores de Alpha 66 y a los clearates
que en esa provincia se han sumado a las acciones.
Este estado de cosas ha llegado a tal situación explosiva, que se esperan en el sar-
so de lo que resta de éste zes importantes acontecimientos que daran un giro avem-
ble a la rebeldía cubana frente al régimen despotico que ocupa el poder.
Ese es en síntesis, el resumen de los informes que hemos recibido donde giguran dites
aún más concretes que de revelarse pormenorizadamente, pudieran acarrear graves peli-
gros a elementos que actuan activamente en esas dos provincias mencionadas.

SSAUL BETHEL
On April 17 (the anniversary of the
1961 Bay of Pigs fiasco) the Cuban exile
military organization Alpha-66 landed
13 comimandos on the east coast of Cuba.
They allegedly were captured, but if so
only after Fidel Castro threw an esti-
mated 25.000 troops into the fray. Cas-
tro lost several men as well.
Then on May 6,Alpha-66 "naval units"
sank, in Cuban waters, two of Castro's
high-scas fishing trawlers (used, as well.
for spying and intiitrating guerrillas into
Latin America).
These two actions set off a chain of
events in Washington that would have
done credit to the LBJ and JFK Ad-
ministrations. With Castro massing his
mobs for a circus of protest, the State
Department hit the panic button and on
May 13 called together representatives
of federal law enforcement agencies to
figure out ways to protect Castro front
further forays of this nature.
What really teed-off the State Depart-
ment was a momentary aberration by
Alpha-68 to trade 11 crew members of
the fishing vessels for the freedom of
survivors of the April 17 landing. They
soon thought better of it and sent a tele-
gram to the Red Cross giving the loca
tion of the men and asking that they be
returned to Caba.
'CIA Invasion"
:
Meanwhile, Castro staged a denson-
stration in front of the former U.S. Em-
bassy in Havana, which is now being
used by the Swiss governinent. He
charged the Swiss, who represent U.S.
interests in Cuba, with complicity in
what he called a "CIA invasion" by
mercenaries.

to attack a nation with which the U.S
is "at peace, to wit: Cuba."
Of the 37 items impounded, those of
military significance were "one large
carton filled with military-type web
cquipment...one military-type ficid
pack...and one farge cardboard carton
filled with plastic military-type can-
teens." With such evidence, Army-
Navy surplus stores could be indicted.
Greater attention was given to files
containing the names of contributors.
These held special interest because the
wording in the warrant found "financial
contributions and disbursements to ob-
taia boats and other supplies" possibly
prosecutable.

"We conclude," the sigantaries said,
"that this part of the rocky laws

Sen. Strom Thurmond (R.-C.C.)
and Rep. William C. Crammer (2.-F.)
strongly support the Cuban exiles in their
interpretation of the law.
One of these subterfuges, say the exiles,
is a recent indictment against Andrés
Nazario Sarpen, head of Alpha-66.
Sargen is charged with havin: "cor-
frora a U.S. arsenal in Connecticut.
His bail was set at $100,000, then in-
explicably reduced to a mere $2,500
and Sargen asked to plead guilty to be
let off on a light sentence.
These shenanigans, say the Cubars,
mean that lacking proof that Alpha-
CS launched its attacks from U.S. soil,
the government will use other means
to intimidate exile action groups. Legal
activa taken against Sargin, they argue,
is imply the caper-beaverism on the
part of what they believe to te pro-Cas-
tro functionaries in the Department of
State,
On the other hand, the Department
of State has its case. Many officials are
oniy slightly less enthusiastic than Cuban
crites to see the end of Castro's Com-
munist regime. Dat they argue that the
haif measures taken by Cuban exile
groups are not effective and merely serve
to-embarrass the United States, Others
claim that the Alpha-66 attacks were
merely ill-timed, providing Castro with
an "excuse" to lay the failure of his
sugar crop at the feet of "CIA opera-
tiyes" based in the United States.
As to this latter claira, those who know
Fidel Castro also know that he needs no
excuse to gather the mobs and denounce
the United States. The history of his
10 years in power bears full witress to
the truth of this view.
Co Viablo Policy
What really conies through in all of
this is that Washington has yet to come
up with a viable policy toward Fidel
Castro to put a stop to his subverting
Latia America and even the United States.
The only absolute factor in the conduct
of foreign affairs is the premium placed

PERSONNEL REPORT - Alpha 66 Doings
May 20, 1966
General remarks on the personnel of Alpha 66:
The Alpha 66 organization is composed of Cuban exiles who are presently residing in the United States.
The majority of the members are located in the Miami, Florida area. The organization is headed by a
former Cuban Army officer, Captain Vicente Mendez. The organization is primarily concerned with
carrying out paramilitary operations against the Castro regime in Cuba.
The organization has been involved in several incidents of violence against the Castro regime. These
incidents have included the sinking of Cuban fishing vessels and the landing of small groups of
commandos on the Cuban coast.
The Alpha 66 organization is well-organized and well-financed. The organization has a strong
leadership and a dedicated membership. The organization is also well-equipped with weapons and
equipment.
The Alpha 66 organization is a significant threat to the Castro regime. The organization's activities
have caused considerable embarrassment to the Castro regime and have also contributed to the
destabilization of the Cuban government.
The Alpha 66 organization is also a potential threat to the United States. The organization's
activities could lead to increased tensions between the United States and Cuba. The organization's
activities could also lead to violence in the United States.
The Alpha 66 organization is a complex and multifaceted organization. The organization's activities
are difficult to monitor and control. The organization's activities are also difficult to predict.
