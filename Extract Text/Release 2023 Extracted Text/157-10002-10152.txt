Papich began with a brief summary of his experi-
ence in the FBI. During World War II and there-
after he ran certain operations in Latin America.
In 1945-47, he ran counterintelligence operations
in Brazil against the Communist Party of Brazil
and bloc intelligence agents. In 1952 he became
FBI liaison with CIA charged with coordinating
and planning, including the development of sources.
He also had special assignments overseas for Hoover.
Papich presented the following overview of the
issues. He has a high respect and regard for the

is no estimate of how many Soviet illegals are in
the United States. The old view was that illegals
would aim at middle-class government and business
positions. It has been discovered that they take
jobs like dishwasher to develop an employment
background. There is no knowledge of Soviet
objectives. Illegals may do nothing for years so
they can be tapped for the future. There may be
100, 500, or 5,000 of them. Some were sent in as
early as the 20's and 30's. They are the Rudolph
Abel-type.
His network was never identified.
Therefore, Papich is clearly unhappy with U. S.
results in identifying Soviet operations in the
United States.
Papich stated that he played a controversial
"devil's advocate" role between the FBI and the
CIA. He did not confer with Attorney General
Mitchell after Helms called his name to Mitchell's
attention. Papich assumes Helms wanted Mitchell
to get a review of the history of FBI-CIA relations.
Papich would not have gone to Mitchell without
checking with other FBI officials.

To understand decisions in 1966 or 1970 it is
necessary to go back to World War II, according
to Papich. President Roosevelt got the FBI into
the foreign intelligence field in World War II.
Overnight the FBI had to generate the capability
to move into Latin America against the German
espionage operation which included business covers,
radio networks, and influence in Latin American
governments.
The FBI had no precedent or guidance.

In 1943-45, the government began looking toward
a worldwide intelligence system.

couldn't do that with foreign police. A foreign
intelligence service cannot operate like a domestic
intelligence agency.
In 1952, when Papich became FBI-CIA liaison, rela-
tionships between the agencies were a mess. Beedle
Smith was CIA director. There were many flaps
between FBI and CIA over CIA political and psycho-
logical warfare, especially regarding the funding
of labor groups, student groups, and political
parties. At the time of the 19 1947 Act, these tech-
niques of "covert action" were the subject of
tremendously heated battles between CIA and State.
There were fewer flaps in the counterintelligence
field.
In the field of political and psychological warfare
operations, the CIA didn't want stereotyped people.
The CIA was not disciplined and ignored jurisdictional
agreements.
It would contact a U. S. newsman about a

possible assignment, the newsman would contact
the FBI to ask what was going on, this would go
to Hoover, who would raise hell with the CIA
director. But Beedle Smith was tough. Communi-
cation between the FBI and CIA was almost non-
existent by 1952.
Papich had no CIA counterpart since the CIA is
so compartmented. He had contacts at all levels,
exchanging ideas for operations. He would push
CIA ideas in the FBI. Flaps would come up. He
would stamp them out and say "get on with the job".

Tolson
Hoover never
expressed a desire to give up his intelligence
job. Nobody, including Tolson, knew Hoover's
reasons for doing what he did. He had his own
conversations and contacts in the White House,
Congress, and his personal sources. He knew what
he was doing and had "a nose and ear for the
political climate in Washington". This was true
for "risky" operations.
Papich believes it would be disastrous to give
both foreign and domestic intelligence duties to
a CIA. While there would be advantages in
coordinating fragmented sources, it is a risk to
liberty, like a national police.
Papich did not recall any significant plan to
improve coordination in 1958 when FBI joined USIB.
FBI was part of the USIB predecessor group.
The CIA would suggest joint field operations but
Hoover would rarely buy it. This was like his
reluctance to join any operation with any other
agencies. He thought the FBI should always have
control, a commanding role. For example, Allan
Dulles discussed the United Nations with Hoover.

Friction would develop in "the gray area" of posi-
tive intelligence. For example, a top foreign
official came to the United States for medical
treatment. The CIA knew he was coming to the U. S.
and wanted to know his relationship with Communists
and wanted intelligence on the instability in the
country. The CIA wants him surveilled to find out
his contacts, what he's saying, and a wiretap or
bug. The FBI would not do this since he was not

more than three to six instances of disagreement.
