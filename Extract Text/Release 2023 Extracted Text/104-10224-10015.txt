SUMMARY OF AGENCY EMPLOYMENT
JAMES W. MCCORD, JR.
Service with the Central Intelligence Agency began on 22
August 1951 and continued through 31 August 1970. During his
career there was a variety of assignments involving investigations,
research and report writing, technical and physical security programs
and a two year tour overseas.
As an investigator during the first two years of employment,
there was wide involvement in a variety of support activities requiring
initiative and ingenuity,
During the seven years engaged in research and report writing,
there was much independence of action and success depended on
initiative, imagination and resourcefuiness in pioneering new areas
of interest. Beginning in May 1957, managerial responsibilities
began with appointment to a Deputy Chief position of a research staff
of some six professional and clerical personnel.
When serving overseas, responsibilities were managerial in
nature as Chief of a regional staff of some ten professional and
clerical personnel providing a full spectrum of security support.
From August 1964 to June 1965 he attended the Air War
College as representative of the Agency.
Since 1965 two vital line positions were held involving the
Agency's programs in the technical and physical security fields.
In heading up the technical security division, from 1965 to
1968, he had primary supervisory responsibility for some 40
professional and clerical personn. 1, preparing the budget and pro-
grams for the Agency's technical security program, and managing
the obligating of authorized funding to assure that approved programs
and goals were met. He was instrumental in guiding the development
of new approaches, in establishing new training concepts and in
bringing the Agency to a position of recognized leadership in this
field.
Since October 1968, as Chief of a division responsible for
the Agency's physical security program he had primary responsibility
for the supervision of some 70 professional and clerical personnel,
together with the programming, budgeting and implementing of the
total physical security program of the Agency. As a result of his
technological experience, he developed and implemented physical
security programs which produced for the Agency a physical security
posture of pre-eminent quality within the US Government.

:
Security Support During
President Nixon's Visit
1. I have received numerous and highly complimentary com-
ments from the Director, the Executive Director and the Acting
Deputy Director for Support for the rele this Office played during the
visit of President Nixon to the Agency on 7 March 1969. In addition,
Mr. Don Gautreau, the Secret Service Agent responsible for protec-
tive measures during the visit, told me that he had never met a more
highly professional group of personnel than our Security officers.
He was impressed with the comprehensive coverage inherent in our
protective measures.
2. Our performance on Friday was smooth, efficient and
effective and once more is a tribute to our ability to rise to any
occasion. This is possible only because of the quality of the effort
put forth by each Security Officer who participated. I am very proud
of all of you and I would like to particularly commend Jim McCord,
Bill Wilkinson and Jim Greene for the work they did in planning our
role in the ceremonies. Equally impressive was the performance of
Hollis Whitaker and his people in the provision of audio coverage of
the event.
3. I would like to have copies of this memorandum placed in
the official Personnel File of every individual who participated in
making this event such a great success.

Mr. Howard Osborn
Director of Security

Dear Mr. Osborn:
On 8 November 1967, Messrs. James McCord, William Flannery,
and William Marcy of your agency provided a most inter-
esting and informative briefing on the subject, "Audio
Threat by the Communiss Block". Included in this preser-
tation was the display of the latest electronic techniques
and technical developments in the area of audio threat.
This presentation was most enlightening and proved to be
of keen interest to the Agency NCS Representatives, staff
members of the Office of the Manager, NCS and selected
key personnel of the Defense Communications Agency.
We very much appreciate the availability of the above
mentioned personnel and I should like to commend them on
their excellent manner of presentation and thorough knowledge
of the subject matter.
