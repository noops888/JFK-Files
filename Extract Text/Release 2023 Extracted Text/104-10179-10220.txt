Additional Information re Nassau Trial
1. The following is for your information and
supplements our memorandum of 11 June 1964 on Manuel
RAY.
24 2. The following message was received from the
British MI-6 representative regarding the payment of
JURE fines in the Nassau case of Manuel RAY:
"Each of the accused persons paid his fine
personally with money obtained for this purpose
after the parties had been permitted, before
appearing in court, to telephone Miami to send
money in case it should be needed. The police
assume that the money came from JURE, but we can
neither deny nor assert any story about actual
source in the U.S. Interrogation of the parties
did not reveal any CIA connection."
