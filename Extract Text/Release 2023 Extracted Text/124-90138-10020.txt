expected to call at other islands, including
Puerto Rico.

debriefing of a crew member, Angel Alfonso TORRES,
who was discharged upon arrival of the launch,

of CASTRO, is traveling around the area on the
pretext of fishing, but is actually spreading
Communist doctrine and distributing Communist
literature at the various ports of call, includ-
ing La Guaira, Venezuela.
c. TORRES was born on 2 August 1934 at La

tion with a seaman named Nicolaas Lourens ENGELHARDT, aka
