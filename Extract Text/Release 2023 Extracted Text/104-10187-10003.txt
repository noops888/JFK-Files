MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Technical Services Division
ATTENTION
SUBJECT
: Chief, TSD/AOB
: Request for TOY Replacement for Arnold F.
AREHART.
!
1. WIH Division requests your cooperation in providing a
TDY replacement for Arnold F. ARCHART as Case Officer and
technician for the IIENVOY tap center in Mexico City. AREPART
has requested three weeks hope leave, from 10 to 28 September,
to drive his older son to the States to enroll him in his
freshman year of college. ARFHART has kept his leave plans
to a minimum so that his TOY replacement will need to be on
loan from Headquarters for as short a time as possible.
2. The Division had offered to provide an operations
officer as a TDY replacement but Hexico City Station has re-
quested that a technician be sent instead since the burden of
AREHART's job is the maintenance of equipment along with the
WE Division sug-
protection of CIA's interests inside the LP.
gests that your release of Mr. Charles Deck for this assign-
nent would be ideal if he is available, as no overlap would
be required since he is already knowledgeable of this opera-
tion. The Station was also very pleased with the work done
by "r. Deck on his last TRY to Mexico.
3. Because of the critical role the LIFNVOY Project
plays in the Station's whole operational picture, and because
of the importance the smooth-functioning of the ! is to car
liaison with top-level Mexican officials, your assistance is
requested. If Mr. Deck is not available, any other suitable
candidate would be acceptable. Please inform Hr. Bustos,
W/1/Mexico, X-4506, -4507 of your decision, as we would like
to be able to inform Mexico as soon as possible as to whether
a TOY replacement will be available.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, TSD/AOB
SUBJECT
: LIENVOY TDY Report
1. TDY support of the LIENVOY operation in Mexico
City was provided by this office during the period 23 April to
15 May 1964. The Staff Agent, ARNOLD F. AREHART who manages
this operation underwent surgery for a hernia on the 24th of April,
The undersigned assumed the responsibilities and performed the
duties associated with the LIENVOY operation during AREHART'S
convalescence. He was incapacitated for duty from 23 April until
12 May. His operation was successful and recovery was normal.
AREHART returned to work on 12 May in a weakened condition and
three days of overlap was allowed to provide assistance with
the more strenuous and tiresome chores.
2. The LIENVOY Installation was found to be in
excellent condition. The operating personnel were well disciplined
and their procedures were well organized. The daily work was
being accomplished in a business like and efficient manner.
AREHART has done a commendable job in establishing and main
taining this highly productive operation,
3. The equipment in this installation has been in use
fifteen hours a day for over four years. As the result of good
maintenance practices it is in good shape and functioning well.
The minor difficulties encountered during the shake down period
have been overcome and equipment maintenance and repair poве
no significant problem There was no loss of coverage on any
line during the three week TDY.
4. The following observations and recommendations are
included herein to improve KURIOT services to the Field and to
aquaint responsible officers with technical discrepancies.
A. Pertinent technical information is not being
communicated to AREHART.

SECRET

B. The drying up of the ball point pens in the B-10,
Dial Recorder has been a constant nuisance since
the beginning of this operation. The pressure
sensitive tape was the obvious answer to this
problem, but the first ten rolls of pressure
tape were received after nearly four years of
struggling with the defective póns. It is
recommended that pressure sensitive tape bo
supplied to this operation for future use.
C. The ten rolls of pressure sensitive tape
received during this TDY were wound back-
wards on their spindles.
D. The tires on the idler wheel of the B-10 are
drying and cracking and fail to obtain adequate
traction on the flywheel. This causes tape
feed problems. It is recommended that three
dozen new idler wheels be pouched to AREHART
immediately. Several of the defective idler
wheels arco available in this office for
inspection.

FYI. 1. In comection Venezuelan complaint to OAS,
discussions in Standing Group of NSC have identified two
alternatives for cooperative system surveillance and interception
of vessels and aircraft engaged in transporting arms for subversive.
purposes to Latin America (especially Caribbean area) directly
or indirectly from Cuba. Difference between alternatives centers
on need for CAS authorization for use of force in international
waters.
2. Alternative A would require OAS authorization use of
force in connection with visit-and-search in international waters
against selected Cuban vessels and selected vessels OAS countries.
It would be a cooperative system of surveillance and interception
involving visit-and-search in international waters on a siective
basis, with force to be used if necessary.
Visit-and-search and,
if resistance met, force would be applied by naval units of US
or of cooperating OAS countries against selected vessels suspcetèd
of transporting arms from Cuba directly or indirectly.

3. Alternative B would not require OAS authorizatio..
use force Inasmuch as visit-and-scarch would take place only
within territorial waters. It would be a cooperative system of
surveillance and interception involving visit-and-search only
within the territorial waters of an OAS country, with force to be
applied, if necessary, by that country's forces or by forces of
another OAS country acting under a bilateral agreement. Control
of suspect vessels destined for non-OAS country or territory
(e. g. British Guiana) would depend on cooperation that county.
4. In both alternatives interception or seizure of
suspect afrcraft would be carried out only in territory of als
country of destination by forces of that country or of another
OAS country acting under a bilateral agreement.
5. Comparison of alternatives:
(a) Alternative A would be much harder to sell to
OAS countries than Alternative B because authorization for use
of force rquired.
(b) Alternative A would be somewhat more effectiv
both in fact and as deterrent than Alternative B, although both
can be circumvented.
(c) Alternative A would constitute harassment of
Castro whereas Alternative B is purely defensive.
(d) Alternative A would incur substantially
greater risks of escalation than Alternative B.

(e) Alternative A would be wore expensive in terms of US units
required than Alternativa 3.
6. Kind and number of sdtional measures which we would seek in
QAS would vary with choice between alternatives. For example, our
tentative thinking is that minimum OAS package acceptable to US under
Alternative A would b. suchariation use force; condemnation Castro
regire; and reaffirmatica Invigoration anti-subversive measures.
Under Alternative B, minira package now estimated to be: defensive
system with search er seiere within national territory; condemnation;
reaffirmation anti-stoveries; and obligatory break in air
and surface communications betaten OAS countries and Cuba.
7. We consider attitude Mexico and Brazil critical. OAS vote
authorizing use fores in which one or other did not join would be
politically undesirable. END FYI.

TEFLO SCORES CAS POLICIES, CURA EXCLUSION
Havana in English to Europe 2020 GIF 11 Decenter 1953--E
(Trot) Mexico City-Mexican Foreign Minister Manuel Cello criticized
the Organization of American States, saying that it is in a state of
crisis. Telle also criticized the exclusion of Cuba from that
organization. In the interview with the Mexican daily NOVEDADES,
Foreign Minister Tello said that Cuba's exclusion from the OS is not
in conformity with the O'S charter. He said that the charter does
not contemplate the exclusion of any member state.
Rezerring to the present international situation of the OAS, Tello
emphasized that an organization which does not base stoelf on friendch
cooperation, and tolerance is likely to face a crisis. The Nexican foreign
minister stated that in the present state of the AS, the clements or

PLAN OF TERRORISM IS UNFOLDING
David La Voz del Paru in Spanish 2100 20 11 December 1963--P
(Station commentary)
(Text) It appears as if a preconceived plan of terrorism, Lot known
before in Panama, has been unleashed since members of our armed forces
were at Fort Guiick. The barbarous death of labor Leader Aguilar,
beaten and kicked in Puerto Armuelles; the beating of Inlian Jator
Leader Palacios Salines; the denunciation thivugh a newspaper of a
labor leader who was lianged and beaten in Colon; another cace in
Boquete; and many other known cases constitute pathetic proof of the
pian.
If the objective of the wave of persecution is to attack the ideas of
men with bullets, sticks, imprisonment, and other similar measures,
it is a stupid move, because ideas are fought with ideas. If some
of the humble class try to protest in defense of their rights, they
are called communists. The privileged classes have used frequently
this pretext against the working classes. If we analyze the situation
we will see how the privileged classes have maintained their own
monopolistic organization.
The oligarchic groups have greatly increased. Yesterday they could be
represented in the two or three existing parties which were directed
and governed by them; today, they have seen the need to increase the
number of political parties, as much as 20 in a small country, in order
to control the public administration. Esch party is formed by a
priviléged family whose only wish is to continue its life of leisure
and luxury. This kind of live calls for plenty of money, so in crder
to obtain the money they need they increase each day the taxation
of the poor, who must pay and thus sink deeper into poverty, disease,
and ignorance.
If the people do not have work, they cannot earn money; and if they
do not have money they cannot pay taxes. If the people try to
organice in self-derense, they are accused of being communists,
and they are fought with sticks. If the cause of all the evils
of democracy is communism, the solution is obvious. We all know who
invented communism, and who is living according to it and upholding it.
The way to fight communism is to open sources of work to build schools,
hospitals, and better roads.
