Available in the CIA Library is a copy of the
Monthly Report for April 1968 prepared by the Special
Branch of the Jamaican Security Service.
2. Highlights of the report follows:
A. The Jamaica (Caribbean) Workers Movement
(1) Kenneth ROWS has been informed by Jonny
JAMEST Chairman of the CARIBBEAN OCTOBER CONGRESS (COC) of
115 Huddleston Road, London, 1.7, that the COS is affiliated
with the Campaign Against Racial Discrimination (CARD) and
was trying to make it a militant massline one". ROWE was
asked to help by writing articles for the, and to set up a
Solidarity Group or small committee to distribute in the
Caribbean-Latia American region documents that would be sent
to him about "white-fascist" attacks against black people
living and working in England. ROWE was asked to accept an
appointment as an Overseas Editor and/or representative of
CLAAP and 'Peoples Voice', a publication of CLAAP and to
aend for publication each month, an article and news commentary..
HOWB was asked to say how many copies he would require for
sale locally. (JamaicanSeriice Comment: CLAAP is believed
to be the Caribbean Latin American Affairs Publications,
374 Grays Inn Road, London, W.C.l (of which JAMES is chairman)
the publishers of 'Carib' magazine which is banned in Jamaica.
Edward o/c Eddie RODNEY, a brother of Dr. Walter RODNEY, came
to notice in 1964 as a manber of the Editorial Board (Assistant
Editor) of the Carib-Latin Ameridan Affairs Publications.
Dr. RODNEY lived with him in London from 1963-66 and accompanied

him to meetings of various extremist groups with which he
was connected.) (Field Comment: Dr. Walter Anthony RODNEY?
Guyanan, employes of the University of the West Indies in
Kingston, was reported to have convened a meeting of UWI
students on campus on 13 February 1963 in connection with
revolutionary activities.)

?
JAMES also forwarded to ROWE a circular
letter, addressed to FOWR and the members of the JCWM, by
the Chairman, A.E.T. HART, and Secretary, R.W.IBE, of the
October Organising Committee for the WORKING PEOPIB'S PARTY
OF ENGLAND (WPPE), 45A Earlafield Road, Wandsworth, London,
S.W. 18, informing him that on 4 and 5 May a Congress of
Leninist citizens of England and other citizens living,
working and studying in London, would be held to inaugurate
the WPPE and requesting him to send a delegate from the
JCWM and/or a fraternal message of revolutionary greetings
and solidarity to the Congress. In support of this JAMES
informed ROWE that the members of the WPPE were the only
white people who had quietly but publicly cooperated with
and supported the COC, and they and the AFRO-ASIAN LIBERATION
FRONT (NFR) (representing the revolutionaries of the national
Liberation movements with headquarters in London) had tested
and proven the WPFE members to be the only genuine Marxist-
Leninists in Britain. ROWE was told that it was very
important and of great urgency to their cause that a message
of solidarity for the Congress should be sent from the JCWM.
(Jamaica Service Comment: A message of solidarity has been
sent by ROWE. A number of copies of 'Carib' and 'The Crusader
(also prohibited in Jamaica) and a variety of small anti-
American and racist stickers were forvarded to ROWE.)
(3) It is said that besause of his job ROWE
now has no time to devote to meetings, but he has been
making a study of the Bible in which he has found certain
passages dealing with revolution which he believes he can
use to avantage, and has conceived the idea of developing
his revolutionary movement along religious lines, as the
Jamaican people are more inclined to support organisations
with a religious flavour.
Bo Dr Cheddi JAGAN
Dr. Cheddi JAGAN arrived in Jamaica by air from
London via Montreal on Il April. He was not met marrival
at Palisedoes Airport but was driven to the home of Dr. Clive
THOMAS by a passenger who arrived on the same aircraft. His
presence in the Island was not generally known and no informa-
tion has been received that any meeting or discussion took
place. On 12 April Dr. THOMAS accompanied him to the Airport,
and he left for Curacao enroute to Port-of-Spain and Georgetown...
(Field Comment: Dr. Clive Yolands THOMAS, a Guyanan, is an

of the West Indies - UWI.)
C.
Illegal Demonstration at Lluidas Vale, St.
Catherine
(1) On 9 April a group of citizens in Iluidas
Vale staged an illegal march in connection with the funeral
of Dr. Martin Luther KING. The police had difficulty in
breaking up the demonstration and subsequently arrested
two of the leaders, BAsil JACKSON, a son of Councillor
Baldwin JACKSON, and Delroy HECKFARD (NPR), a schoolteacher.
Charges of brutality have been made against the Police, and
on 20 April JACKSON and SECKFORD consulted Dennis DALY with
a view to bringing an action for assault. They took the
ppportunity to ask DALY to make arrangements for (socialists'
fron Kingston to visit Lluidas Vale at an early date to lecture

a group of youths there. Cecil ANDERSON of the JCWM was also
invited to visit Lluidas Vale when arrangements for the lecture
were completed. (Jamaica Service Comment: JACKSON, who
describes himself as a Radio Engineer and Sociological
Student, left Jamaica in 1959 for England and spent four
years there studying Radio and Television Engineering. In
1963 he went to Spain and during 1963-64 made frequent visits
to Tangiers. In June 1964 he was imprisoned in Spain for
drug smuggling. He was deported to Tangiers in April 1965,
and eventually repatriated to Jamaica on 22 June 1965. He
declered to be a staich supporter of Communism and had
Communist literature in his possession. He was at that
time closely associated with a member of the YOUNG SOCIALIST
LEASUE (YSL) who lived at Iluidas Vale.)
D. The Jamaica Council for Human Rights
(1) The first issue of the Newsletter of the
Jamaica Council for Human Rights (JCHR) was circulated to
members during the month. This is to be a quarterly
pulication. It was reported that in addition to Dr. M.B.
DOUGLAS and Noel EDWARDS, Mrs. Leon BROWN of the Jamaica
Teachers' Association and Edwin JONES OF THE NEW WORLD
GROUP (NWG) were co-opted to the Managing Committee for
1967/63. At the time of publication of the Newslatter there
were only about 90 members, and the total resources of the
Council were £20.7.3. Copies of the Constitution and a
statement by the Council on "The Passports Issue" wers.
also circulated to members.
COS (2) On the Subject of "The Winston Davis Casez,
it was reported that a special sub-committee has been set up
to investigated the whole question of passports and the
Council is investigating the possibility of legal action
to test whether such action by the Government amounts to
an infringement of the citizen's Constitutional Rights.
If the Council's lawyers advise that it is worthwhile to
institute such proceedings, it will be necessary to raise
substantial funds to enable the Council to sponsor this
case.
Members have been asked to give their support.

(1) Harold LAWRENCE o/c Duckie, self-styled leader
of the Rastafarians in Javanna-la-Har, and George MYERS were
the speakers at a meeting organized recently by the Anglican
Brotherhood of St. Andrew in Savanna-la-Har, to which seven
Rastafarians were invited to give a brief history of their
doctrine. LAWRENCE said that they were despised and rejected
by the Government and the public because of the doctring of peace
and love which they preached, but Babylon - the Western World-
would soon fall by violence and they would then establish
God's Righteous Kingdom. MYERS called for tolerance and
respece for the Rastafarian doctrine. He referred to the
injustices being meted out to the beethern - oppression by
the Government, brutality by the Police and rejection by
society which had resulted in thebrethren developing a violent
attitude. In their search for comfort and liberation they
bad turned to Haile SELASSIE. He asked the Church, the
Government and the public to help by providing work Dr them.
I. New Creation Peacemakers Tabernacle (formerly African
Reform Church)
(1) Contact with Left Wing
(a) On 31 March, Walter RODNEY, accompanied by
his wife and children, went to Kemps Hill, Clarendon, where
he held a private discussion with Claudius HENRY, Edna HENRY,
Rupert AHWEB and Kenneth MORGAN. RODNEY stated that his
volvement with the New freation Peacemakers Tabernacle
(NCPT) depended on the continued expansion of the moveant
and the training of young man ih revolutionary methods
He referred to the worsening economic situation in Jamaica
which, he declared, would drive the masses to rebellion,
the extent of which would be determined by the effective
organization of such groups as the NCPT. The movement could
be quite useful, because any Leader who tried to quell the
anger of the masses would be swept away. He stated that
KHM LOZAKE had met Peter PERERA, formerly of Knox Printery,
who was a Trotskyist. He claimed that he himself was a
Trotskyist and had studied TROTSKY's assessment of the Fourth
International Revolution. In his view, the "Colonies" were
ready for a revolution and if the pressure is kept up and
the masses trained, in due course, Capitalism could be overthrown
(b) It was the opinion of HENRY and his supporters
that with the number of able-bodied men in the organisation,
a successful revolution could be plainsdagainst the Government
at a future date. With this in mind, HENRY is now planning
to launch an active campaign throughout the Island and to
recruit as many young men as possible into the movement.
(c) MORGAN suggested that as many NCPT members
De possible should be enlisted into the Army and the Police
Porce as they would obtain worthwhile training and valuable
infomation. He spoke of the need for literature and said
Ram John MATTEDWS7 who is employed at the Cuban Consulate,

had promised to obtain some for the organization and deliver
same at 15A Charles Street. (Jamaica Service Comment: After
the conference, AHWEE stated that in his opinion RODNEY is
working for an international organisation with the intention
of establishing a revolutionary movement in Jamaica and that
he had seen the potential for a revolution in the NCPT. He
also thinks that RODNEY favours the Chinese/Cuban form of
Communiam.) (Feld Comment: Rupert AHWEE is a member of a
secret revolutionary group within the JCWM.)
(2) NCPT
(a) 75 Waltham Park Road. During themonth
weekly meetings were held by the HCPT at 75 Waltham Park
Road. Rudolph GORDON and Roy GREY were the chief speakers.
References were made to therecent assassination of Martin
Luther KING and a warning issued that the Prime Minister
should be careful as he might be the next one to be shot.
(Members were encouraged to join a "partner" of ten shiblings
weekly as this would assist in the running of the church)
GORDON stated that HENRY was gathering soldiers to "fight
the war". He spoke of the increased taxes levied on the
poor people while certain Civil Servants had been given wage
increases and Members of Parliament provided with entertainment
allowances. He referred to the hardships endured by Cubans
under BATISTA and praised Fidel CASTRO for what he was doing
for his country. Thoses who were leaving Cuba he accused of
having a "colonial" mentality.
(3) Activities in Clarendon
:
(a) Kemps Hill. Highlights of the activities
in Kemps Hill were the three-day celebration and Baptism
from 30 March to 1 April when AHWER and about 78 others were
baptized, (thus bringing the total number baptised to about
839) and the function in honour of HENRY's 65th birthday on
28 April. The day's celebration commenced at about 11.00 am
with a pasudo religious service conducted by HENRY, followed
by a march past by the Boys Brigade and the crowning of
HENRY by Omroy BROWN. The crown carried a black star which
BROWN said symbolized the BLACK POWER MOVEMENT (BPM) of which
HENRY is the Leader, and that he would reign forever.
.::
In his address, AHWER said that it was Black Power that would
defend the Black man's rights in Jamaica so they should
support HENRY. Ha was then presented with several envelopes
containing money. At the regular meeting HENRY continued
to declare his intention to take over" the Government by 1972
and asked his members to be loyal to him as very soon they
would be called upon to defend the Cause. There was no
turning back, for his work and worth had gained the recognition
of the Socialists in Jamaica and he would establish his
Government with bombe and guns. He spoke of the viotimisation
of NCPT members by the Governmentand said there would be
"blood in Jamaica for the Goverment believe that they are
mighty". The Kingdom of God, he said, is a Socialias one and
his (HENRY's) kingdom will be like it * offering shelter and
clothèng to the poor. He was no longer interested in the
Back-to-africa Movement as he and his followers must enjoy
the amenities in Jamaica. He said that he had been sent to
deliver the poor people from their sufferings and like CASTRO,
his friend, he was determined to destroy the frach men in
Jamaica. Despite the efforts of the Government, HENRY declared,
Jamaica would very shortly embrace Communism and nothing could
stop this. AHWEE stated that HENRY intended to establish a
Socialist Government in Jamaica which would look after the
Welfare of those who have been rejected by the Capitalist
Government. He emphasised that all the leading countries
in the world were Socialist controlled. The HCPT Bakery is
reported to be doing a flourishing business, and members feel
that the delivery of bread throughout the Island will offer
aaderful opportunity to spread the doctrine to the people

Federation Incorporated (EWFI) which was held at La Corona
Hall, 71 North Street, on 18 April. Haughton BROWN stated
that the fund-raising drive would continue in the Corporate
Area in an effort to increase the amount of £760 already

Federation had been granted permission to stage a march in
Kingston on 21 April. This would terminate at La Corona

A.
Ethiopian Orthodox Church (ECC)
(1) At a meeting of the Ece held at 84 Spanish
Town Road recently, and attended by about 25 persons, Z.
Monroe SCARLETT, the guest speaker, Baid that the Movement
was on the verge of collapsing because members of the Cult
were not firm enough with the Government about the question
of repatriation. He suggested that they should organis
marches in an effort to force the Government to send them
back to Africa, and he urged them to emulate the American
Negroes who were fighting for their freedom.
:
(2) SCARIETT said that Dr. H. B. Douglas had been
asked by some Rastafarians to become the head of the organisati on
and he was willing to assist them with their plans.
L. Universal Negro Improvement Association (IWNIA)
(1) Copies of a leaflet issued by the (UNIA) were
found at the intersection of Hanover/Law Streets, Kingston

between the two organisations.
M. Nation of Islam (NOI)
(1) 84 Church Street - Members of the WILSON faction
of the NOI recently removed from 165E King Street to the
above address. Two meatings were held at 842 Church Street

whim could and the white man's practice of robbingthe bla
prople of everything.

(b) At the meting on 24 April, Ceceil CAMPER IL
0/0 Prince Buster stated that premises 47 Charles Street
belonged to him and he was willing for it to be used:
for the assistance of the black race. He called for unity
anohy black people and said that his organisation was fighting
to rule Jamaica. He told members that they should be prepared
to meet the Rev. SHERRIFFE X who would soon be visiting the
Island. (Field Comment: CAMPBELL has spoken over Kingston
broadcasting statein Radio Jamaica and Rediffusion - RJR.
Reverend SHERRIFFE X is probably the Arabic organizational
nare for Thomas VIEN, an American Black Muslim who together
with one Robert FRAZIER recently visited CAMPBELL. FRAZIER
and VIEW were seized in early May by the Jamaican police in
a raidon CAMPHELL's home which also netted a quantity of
Black Muslim literature.)
N. Jamaica Congress of Labour
(1) Christopher LAWRENCE and W.A. PUSSY of the Printers
and Allied Workers Association (PAWA) recently held discussions
concerning the expansion of the PAWA, and affiliate of the
JCL. (Jamaica Service Comment: PUSSY is employed by the
Times Printery, but is understood that pamphlets put out by
the PANA are produced at the office of the Kingston and St.
Andrew Corporation.)
(2) LAWRENCE was also in contact with Calvin DUCKETT,
William CHARLES and Roy PHILBEERT, and a joint letter by the
JCL and the JAMAICA COUNCIL OF CONSUMERS UNION (JCCU)
protesting against the arrival of the Jamaios Provader"
which it olaimed, would deprive Jamaicans of work as the ship
was equipped with mechanical loaders, was sent to the Prime
Minister...
(3) (Field Comment: The JCL recently claimed
credit for the first mase union activity ever held in Jamaica,
a meeting in commemoration of Dr. Martin Luther King, in
January 1968 LAWRENCE was reported to have been in close
contact with IBITH and Janet MCMURRAY, Canadian Communists
visiting Jamaica to assess the political situation.)
O.
Black Power Movement (BPM)
(1) During the month, several discussions were held
at 4 Cookhorn Lane concerning the BPM.
(2) On the 5 and 8 April discussions were held
by George VASSEL on the possibility of holding demonstrations
at the American Embassy to protest against the assassination
of Dr. Martin Luther KING. VASSEL claimed that there was a
United States citizen hiding in Jamaica to escape the draft who
had in his possession recording of speeches made by the late
Malcolm X during 1964. One of these was entitled "The Ballot
of Bullete". He stated that KING's death disproved his theory
of non-violence and was bringing.to prominence men like.
Stokely CARMICHAEL and H. Rap BROWN. The demonstration
suggested by VASSISL did not in the event take place.
(3) About 40 persons including Winston MONROE,
Joseph CHRISTIR, Roy JEFFREY, Leonard SOLOMON and one Ny
SURVAD, the American referred to above, met at 29 Fourth
Street, Trench Town (Dallas Corner), where SURVAD, identified
as a Black Muslin and a member of the BPM, answered questiona
put to him by the gathering. It was understood that SURVAD
wea in Jamaica to so solicit support for the BPM in the USA
Ha well as to establish a branch here. The record "The
Ballot or Bullets" was played by SURIAD and recorded by MONROE.
(4)
At this meeting SURVAD said that he had come
to Jamsica because of its multi-racial population and because it
13-00000

was likely that the Civil Rights boys would have to comer
here during the summer when they made things "hot" and.
were hunted by the Authorities.
(5) During a private discussion with SURVAD at
Herman KING's home in Pembroke Hall, George MYERS suggested
that the recording of "The Ballot or Bullets" should be.
circulated locally and that Prince Buster should be asked to
assist, with a view to sales being promoted close to this
year's Independence Celebrations.
(6) SURVAD accepted MYERS' invitation to attend
a get-together which he was arranging in Savanna-La-Mar on
11 May, and to spend a week or two with him there. They
discussed the Congress on Racial Equality(CORE) and the
BPM, and it was suggested that a local Steering Committee
should be appointed to consider the formation of a group
in Jamaica.
(7) MYERS said that everything should be done
to establishethe Movement on a firmfooting. In the absence
of a Revolutionary Movement, the "Revolutionaries" should
acquaint themselves of the world situation. He recommended
the importation of revolutionary literature from all avail-
able sourced (with particular emphasis on BPM and Liberation
Struggles in Africa). Close contact should be maintained
with the NEW WORLD GROUP (NWG), and with the Labour movement,
HENRY'S NCPT and any other organisation with a genuine mass
appeal. He pointed out that the duty of the revolutionary
