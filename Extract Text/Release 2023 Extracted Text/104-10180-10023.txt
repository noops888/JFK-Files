25th: Picked up Sedative and cave fer a bottle of scotch and she
asked me to come to her apertont ad help her drink it. I will.
I must find out if she is taciturn or just naturally cut. If a

Mrs. Poseman called and invited me and mine to a tirthday
party she is riving for her mushind. There is something about
this artistic circle that isn't altomter normal. I intend to

A scotch and soda, even tocet the shoes it with surprising
moderation, seemed to relax her inhititions. It untied her tongue
tut not to the point of loncity.learned something of her
backround: a Boncatan circle, Brently centering around her,
troke up as the artist norbers sarried one by one. I sensed a
bitterness, a disillusionment and many unspoken reproaches against
herself as well as aainst others. She now is a fiance' but
he does not seem to loom oom very lay on the landscare. Before
