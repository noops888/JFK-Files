Request for 10 Intercession to Facilitate Entry of Identity A
D PULRANCES
AR: See Paragraph below
1. Identity A, who is the mother of AMICE/31, a Station asset,
has been twice danied permission to enter the United States as a
refugee from Cuba. The local ODURGD office has stated that
Identity A has been placed on a denied admissions list because of
information supplied by ODACID.
2. According to AMICE/31, Identity A applied for admission to
the United States with her daughters, Identities B and C. Identi-
ties Fand C received the necessary authorization on 24 February
1955 from the Swiss Enbassy and arrived in the United States by air
on 28 Fabriary.
3. Identity A was the wife of Identity D, a namber of the
Cuban Communist Party for some twenty years, at the time of her
firat application to leave Cuba. Identity D died in October of
1965 and according to AMICE/31 lost his Communist Party membership
card about a year prior to his death. According to AMICE/31,
Identity A has never foined or bean a peaber of the Cornist
Party although there is a possibility that her husband may hava
placed der name on the mumbarshin lista, AMICE/31 15o stated that
she has long been a practicing Catholle and that she is very anti-
Comeninist. Sent an superete cover attachments are twe atatevents
fross the alahon of bienfues and the Assistant Bishop of Havana
testifying to her good character and to her standing as a practic-
Iny Catholic.

It is requested that Headquarters contact the
appropriate ODACID and GOURSE officials for the purpose
of removing Identity A's name from the denied admissions
list since her close connection with a member of the Cuban
Communist Party, which presumably was the basis of the
derogatory information, is no longer a fact.
