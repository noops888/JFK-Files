Reference:
Potential operation
HA-41087, 29 September 1971
1. We appreciate the detailed progress report on KDAFGHAN
submitted by reference. The complete description of KDAFGHAN
personnel, working routine, facilities and equipment was very
helpful in understanding how this project functions.
2. Regarding your request for WOACRE advice and guidance
on hot-miking the lines running into the gatehouse and consulate,
we have discussed this possible operation with WOACRE here who
offer the following comments. First, to accomplish a hot-mike
installation, you must be able to get access to the telephone
wires. If you can gain access to the phone lines, it would be
possible to hot-mike the telephone without getting to the instru-
ment itself. However, a non-access system like this will not
work if the target line goes through a switchboard or if there
are multiple telephone lines going into the same instrument.
Based on your description of the embassy telephone system, it
would appear to rule out a hot-mike operation unless you can find
and gain access to a single line that does not go through a switch-
board. Any such operation, if one is proposed, would have to be
unilateral because the non-access system is not for exposure to
liaison.
3. It is possible that your interests in this operation
could be served equally well by an audio penetration of the
gatehouse. Such a penetration could be made by a carry-in
"quick plant" type of transmitter. Perhaps one of your agents who
regularly visits the gatehouse could be employed to carry in a
device, or you could exploit KDTUCK-4's close friendship with
KDACOUSTIC-11 to get a transmitter into the target. We would
appreciate your comments.

Operational Activities:
This Project continued as before
for the major portion of this period with KDAFGHAN providing photo
coverage for eight hours per day, five days per week, of the AMFINK
installation. In April the principal agent, KDAFGHAN-1, was provided
with new photographic equipment to improve the quality of the take.
This later proved unuseable as sunlight playing on the mirror of
the lens was plainly visible from the target area in the afternoons.
The Agont returned to the use of his old equipment. It being the
current Case Officer's practice to hold nearly all meetings with
this Agent in the Case Officer's auto about once every two weeks we
decided to terminate the KDAFGHAN safehouse as unnecessary.
KDAFGHAN-1 was notified of this in early June and nearly collapsed.
The safehouse had been his refuge from the OP and his mother,
KDAFGHAN-2. We intended to put him on vacation when it was decided
(References B and C) to terminate him and his Project. The last
portion of this period was then spent in closing down the operation,
removing equipment from the OP, restoring the OP to its original
condition and then assisting the Agents in their preparations for
resettling to Madrid. All of this was finally accomplished by
31 July and the Agents were formally terminated on 1 August.

amount because of the large severance pay paid both agents who had
over ten years service each. KDAFGHAN-1 was paid U.S. $8,170.00
and KDAFGHAN-2 was paid U.S. $2,228.48.
6. Plans: We have no plans to replace KDAFGHAN with another
strictly photo-surveillance project. The production does not
justify the cost. However, we do have plans to obtain a multi-
purpose basehouse in the area that can serve as a site for taking
photos when necessary, serve as a LP for future audio operations
against AMFINK, and as a base from which to dispatch a future
surveillance team. The PBRUMEN section has already started the
search for agent assets who, in turn, can look for an appropriate
site. The acquisition of the latter will be the most difficult as
rental property is at a premium in the AMFINK area.
