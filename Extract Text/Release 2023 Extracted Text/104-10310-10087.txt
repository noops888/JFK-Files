Dear Mr. Elder: :
This is to confirm our discussion of February 20
regarding the deposition of certain requests of the Select
Committee: .
(1) With regard to the Committee's letter of February 6,
and CIA's letter response 76-0200/1 of February 11, I asked
that a further attempt be made to identify the initials
"G.Ν.Ν.". Those initials follow handwritten comments on a
March 1965. document in the AMLASH file which proposed giving
the Cuban government information which might compromise
AMLASH.
(2) With regard to the Committee's letter of January
12 and CIA's letter response 76-0062/1 of February 11, I
asked that CIA review its files on Osvaldo Dorticos, Presi-
dent of Cuba, to determine if the message received by Dr.
Portell-Villa was placed in those files.
(3) Dan Dwyer and I reviewed the list of CIA person-
nel at the Mexico City station referenced in CIA's letter 76-
0083/3 of February 11 and agreed the list should remain at
the Agency.
(4) I requested the Select Committee be provided the
current address and telephone number of Mr. John Whiten, the
Desk Chief for Mexico in 1963.
(5) With regard to the Committee's letter of January
29, requesting that two current Agency employees be made
available for interviews, we agreed the Agency should provide
the Committee a letter stating whether or not these employees
were readily available for interviews.

(5) Dan Dayer and I reviewed Agency originated
documents in CLA's 201 File on Gilberto Policarpo Lopez.
It is our understanding you would reconsider CIA's decision to
deny the Comittee's request for a copy of these documents.
(7) With regard to the Committee's letter of January 30,
we agreed:
(a) We would for the time being narrow the request
in paragraph 1 to include only contacts of Director McCone;
(b) We would not alter the requests in paragraphs
2 and 3.

I trust this summary accords with your understanding of
our discussion, but please let me know if there is any
misunderstanding.
Sincerely,
James Holinato
James H. Johnston
