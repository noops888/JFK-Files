MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT:
Meeting With WUSLAB/17 on 24 February 1970
1. WUSLAB/1 phoned on 21 February and told me of his
medical plans. He had been examined by the doctors at
NIH who confirmed the verdict that he had small and large
tears in his two retina. The NIH7specialists had photo-
graphed his retinas and on the basis of their examination
they think he should have an operation on the largest tear
in the left retina and use friosurgery on some of the other
holes. They have arranged to have (W/1 examined at a retina
clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore (W/17 will
go there on 27 February. He will also go back to [NIH]on
25 February where they will check the hematology of his
blood. The blood vessels in the eye and even the lids
are enlarged, so they will check his blood out.
2. I went
to
[W/13
on 24 February at 1100. (W/ 1 was alone in the downstairs
home as arranged by the phone call
part of the house. He was wearing dark glasses and the
light was muted. He has been confined to his house pretty
much, but asked for a ride downtown as he had to sign
checks in his office. He is not reading anything and cannot
look at television.

3. (W/1 recently received a call from Ortiz in the [OPI]
in New York stating that both the head and the deputy of
the UN office in Mexico City were resigning at the end of
this year. This is not only an OPI office, but also UNDP,
etc. W/1 showed some interest in the position in Mexico.
「Vladimir Pavlechenko phoned and wished him well on his
eyesight problem. (Pavlechenko made a joke about political
vision.
4.
[W/1]
In commenting on health W/1/said that he had seen
Ralph Bunche in New York on one of his recent trips. Bunche
did not recognize him at once. Bunche then said that he
expected to be blind by the end of 1970. The Soviets had
arranged for him to be examined at a famous eye clinic in
Odessa. They had told him that there was nothing they
could do, or could be done to save his sight. Bunche's
eyes suffer from a deterioration of the blood vessels in
the eye.
