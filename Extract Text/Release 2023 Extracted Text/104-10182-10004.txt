Status Report
In November 1959 Cover Branch assisted SR/DOB Case Officer
Fred kiripatrick in formulating cover under which AESENTINEL agent
AEASPIC could live and thus be released from 24-hour custody.
ABASPIC was documented under the name David Durvard and was so
registered by Alien on Arfairs Staff. AEASPIC carries a cover letter
issued by Alien Affairs to this effect.
SR/DOB Case Officer Fred Kirkpatrick was
under the name Fred K. Komer, a self-employed manufacturer's repre-
was docucented ated (see below)
sentative, presently engaged, with David Darvard, in adapting
certain American automatic coin-operated vending machines to the
French merket, in particular in the Paris area. Mr. Dirvard is
serving as Mr. Koner's engineer/technical advisor.
This arrangement has to date worked entirely satisfactorily,
and it is hoped will continue to function until about mid June, when
aforementioned cover arrangement should be discontinued owing to
resumption of operational training. Fur further information, please
contact Fred Kirkpatrick on Ext. 8331.

Ma Cocotte cherie.
Voici la deuxième lettre que je t'acris D'ailleurs c
ngest pas seulement à toi que j'ai envoye des lettres, mais
aussi à mon frere, au toubib et mon ex-belle soeur,et aussi aux
genssches qui j'atais avant de vous quitter voici un an passé.
J'avais écrit d'ici dès que j'avais pu le faire,c'est à dire
il y a de cold trois mois environ.Je n'ai jamais reçu aucune
réponse à l'adresse que j'avais donnée ! J'espere que cette-fois
J'aurais plus de chance car il doit y avoir certainement une
raison quelque-part. Comme c'est la mode ces tompa-gi,ou bien
l'avion qui portait mes lettres s'est écrasé quelque-part,ou
bien celui qui rapportait les reponses a fait la mawe chose,ou
alors ce qui serait plus prda de la verit,il n'y a jamais eu
de reponse pour une raison qui m'échappe. Il est possible aussi

pays que j'avais 150ccasion de visiter, ayant été un pou partout,
mais comme je n'aime pas repeter les mêmes choses plusieurs fois,
vous ne saures rien dutout si je n'ai pas de reponse à cette
lettre aussi.
Je suis revenu seulement hier d'une promenade do dour

SUBJECT: Observations during Period 20 April 2 May of D. Tarient.
1. Physical Description:
Seight: 5'6"
Weight: 120 lbs.
Hair:
Eyes:
Black balk headed
Dark Brown
Distinguishing marks:
2. Physical Condition:
Missing first joints of right thunb and right
first finger. Hears moustache (black)
Subject seems to enjoy walking and running. He remarked that he could
trot along three miles in one hour.
3. Eating Habits:
Subject is not too impressed with American way of eating, that is,
having all the food put on the table and then each taking a portion of each
course and filling up the plate.
Subject feels that more time should be devoted to eating than Joe C.
alloted for eating. He was amazed that it only took the latter about 15
minutes to eat. Likewise, Subject likes to eat one course at a time and
that each course be brought into the room and placed on the table separately.
After the meal he would like fresh fruit, cheese, coffee. He does not care
ruch for sweets, neither does he care for cottage cheese salad, l.e.,
cottage cheese and canned fruit. This combination irks him. Subject was
assured that this was a manner of eating in America and that it was a
custom and that the undersigned probably would find some faults with the
way the French serve food. Dave enjoys fruit juices.
Dave eats his food in the manner to which he is accustomed. He puts
only one course on his plate and only when finished eating it does he help
himself to the next course, etc.
At breakfast he is a very light eater. He is content just with
coffee, toast and juice.
4. Freetime:
During the undersigned's stay with Subject, most of the freetime was
spent watching TV, walking and attending English lessons. Subject stated
that he wanted to la iglich, so the undersigned accommodated him. A
35 cent Cardinal edition of "English thru Pictures" was purchased for hin
and was used as the text book. Subject was coming along fairly well in the
language. Subject is able to manage satisfactorily in the language only

thing which hinders his is his lack of confidence. Time will probably
take care of his improvement.
5. General Remarks:
He was amazed that he was in the U.S.A., though he was here he stated
that he could not believe that he was here. The relative seclusion during
the past two weeks did not reassure him in anyway that he definitely was
in the U.S.A. Nany of his ideas regarding American seemed to be impressions
that he obtained from seeing American films while in France. Thus he has
a little difficulty trying to place the America that he has observed now
with what preconceived ideas that he already has of America.
While in town on 23 April, his only remark about Washington was that
he did not see any exceptionally beautifully girls (Hollywood types). Ee
also stated that the American males, i.e. American Soldier in 1945, was
nice strong, healthy type of male.
Enroute from the airport Dave wore his blackout glasses until we
reached the district line. while crossing the South Capital Street Bridge
Dave sensed that we were brossing the bridge because of the vibrations caused
by the car passing over the steel mesh on the bridge, stated that we must
be crossing the Fotomac river now. Another question was how far was the
airport from the house where we were headed. The undersigned agreed that
we were crossing the Fotomac and that the area we were going to was over
fifty miles from the district.
:
By nature Dave is very curious. To satisfy his curiousity he uses
various ruses in order to elicit information regarding his status and
future.
Whenever the undersigned went for a walk with Dave, usually before
and after meals, the former expected to be asked numerous personal
questions. One or twice, Dave mentioned that he did not know why he was
here, what kind of job he would have, etc.
Dave was assured that this sounded somewhat irregular, the undersigned
felt that he mist have been told something womewhere along the line. At
this point, Dave would stop asking questions. Later on the undersigned
learned that Dave was very talkative with Tom Miller (alias) and told the
latter the whole story about what was told to date. It is assumed that
Dave was trying to show Tom that he knew everything and thus hope that
Tomé would fill any little details that Dave would omit. These were two
different approaches that Dave used trying to elicit information from the
undersigned and Tom Miller.
Dave seems to be quite a perfectionist when it come to things
mechanical. While at the Log Cabin, Dave tried on af number of occasions to
adjust the TV set. Dave could not understand why the TV set sometimes
would not function properly particularly whenever a passing plane would go
over it would interfere with the sets operation. This account did not
suit him for he had to try and adjust, so as a result more time was
expended on adjusting than watching TV. He was quite irked because he felt
that the TV was malfunctioning.
Dave likes to watch cowboy and gangster files, and the children
עבודמיק. Ped to tie because the participants spoke very slowly
and he could understand the language.
Periodically, Dave would cuestion the undersigned on schedule for the
day and when told what it would be it seemed that he would fall to hear
what was told to hin and later on would propose the same question. Dave did
not like the idea that he had to start English from basic he wanted to
have something more ad
advance
Dave like to test others and it seems that he will continually do so
throughout the course.
Dave did not seen to impressed with the idea that he had to be
debriefed all over again. His comment was that he told this over and
over so many times and that it was not necessary to do over again. At
times when he did not want to answer a question he would state that he
already told this to George and drop the matter there.
1 May 1959:
Shortly before Dave's departure for another safehouse, Dave remarked
that he was not much concerned about the training that he will have to
undergo during the next phase but is concerned more about "der Tat." what
he was driving at was to try to elicit what information he could regarding
the work that he will be required or expected to fulfill once training is
over, i.e., the mission. Dave was assured that this naturally would follow
only
