The following comments are in answer to paragraphs 1,
3, 6 and 7 of referenced memorandum (paragraphs 2, 4 and 5
are to be answered by other components in the Agency):
a. Concerning paragraph 1, the initials which
appear on papers in the AMLASH file, identified as_"G.N.N."
by the SSC, are believed to be "G.W.R.", those of Grace W.
3 Roberts. Ms. Roberts was an Intelligence Assistant assigned
to the Latin America Division. She retired in February 1969.
b. The only information in the Latin America
Division concerning Gilberto Lopez mentioned in paragraph 3
is a report that confirms his travel to Cuba on 27 November
1963. This travel information is already reflected in
Lopez 201 file.
24 с. The cryptonym mentioned in paragraph 6 refers
to the liaison program our Station in Mexico City maintains
with the Mexican Security Service
3,39
d. The Mannells referred to in paragraph 7 are
not located in the Washington area. They could be made
available to the SSC, however, given a reasonable time
frame of at least two or three days notice.
