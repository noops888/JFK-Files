2. In mid-Jr 1966 a group of officers was said to be looking for
a "way out" (French, "la sortie") for Castro. Although informed
of this project, Castro is taking no action, while following the
affair closely. This group of officers, made up of members of
the 26th of July Movement, is directed by Pedriret Prieto, a
Cuban Commander (PCC) Central Committee member, and by
Humbert Castellanos, Director of National Port Service.
United States (11 June 1966)
Source, Para. 2: a prominent exile with well defined poli-
tical ambitions. Source is a fairly reliable reporter. In addi-
tion to maintaining an unusually large number of direct and in-
direct contacts among Cuban exiles and influential Latin American
nationals, he has some contacts in Cuba. Source said that he ob-
tained this information from a governmental employee on the island.
2. In late April 1966 unrest within the FAR was unquestionable, and
military leaders like Juan Almeida Bosque, Sergio del Valle
Jimenez, and Pedro Miret, who have gained the respect and admira-
tion of the troops gave the appearance of supporting the régime
more out of loyalty than of conviction. These men are devoted
to their military duties, and they follow the leader or the cause
for which they fought against Batista, without becoming influenced
by Communist ideology. Majors Bernardo Ordaz Sucarnge and Victor
Bordiejo, who are not Communist Party members, are isolated
from their ships; Ordaz is preoccupied with his job in the Havana
Psychiatric (formerly Mazorra) Hospital, and Bordiejo has been re-
legated to an unimportant post.

Headquarters Comments
1. Paragraph 4 of CS-311/08789-66 from an official Spanish
service, identifies other Army officers who are said to be
continuing efforts to organize rebellion; Miret and
Castello were not mentioned in the Spanish Service report.
Castello is reportedly an intimate friend of Faure Cozon
Mediavila, Minister of Transportation and leader of the
13th of March Revolutionary Directorate, an organization to
which Castello belonged.
2. Unlike Miret and del Valle, Almeida is not a PCC Central
Committee member; del Valle is a member of the Political
Bureau and also of the Revolutionary Armed Forces and State
Security Committee of the Central Committee of the PCC.
3. TDCS-314/02675-66 contains Bordon's comments about unrest
in the FAP, which, in his opinion, is greater every day but
does not pose a current threat to the Castro régime because
mutual distrust between officers, noncommissioned officers,
and enlisted men makes any united action impossible. Bordon
is one of numerous Army officers whose arrest has been re-
ported by refugee sources in the purge which followed the
Cubela trial. CS-311.05970-66 and reports referenced therein
contain speculation on the reasons behind the purge, includ-
ing the possibility that the purge is directed at members
of the 13th of March Revolutionary Directorate.
