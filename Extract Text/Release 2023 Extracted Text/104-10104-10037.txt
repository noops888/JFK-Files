July
1. AT MEETING 17 KEF (WHICH OCCURED PRIOR RECEIPT REF
AND BEFORE WE HAD OPPORTUNITY TO DECIDE ON PARA 3 BELOW
APPROACH) BARKER SAID HE SEES NO PROBLEM IN AMSTRUT-2 ACTING
AS OWN SPONSOR INSTEAD OF AMHIM, ALSO THAT ESTIMATED EXTRA
COSTS TO WNYW WOULD BE $25 TO $50 PER WEEK TO COVER EXPENSES
OF MONITORING TAPES BEFORE BROADCAST IN COMPLIANCE WITH FCC
REGULATIONS, AND THAT IF PROGRAM TO CONTINUE WNYW WOULD REQUIRE
ONE EXTRA TAPE OF EACH BROADCAST AND ENGLISH TRANSLATION FOR
REVIEW BY NEW YORK MANAGEMENT.
PRESENT SYSTEM IS FOR AMSTRUT-2
TO SEND TAPES DIRECTLY TO BROADCASTING FACILITY IN MASSACHUSETTS
WHERE IT GIVEN CASUAL REVIEW. WNYW PLANS MORE THOROUGH REVIEW
OF CONTENT IF PROGRAM CARRIED.

:
THAT IF PROGRAM MEETS THEIR STANDARDS IT SHOULD BE BROADCAST.
BELIEVE THIS IS OPTIMUM PRACTICAL COURSE IN AVOIDING BOTH
APPEARANCE OF ANY PRESSURE ON WNYW AND ANY UNNECESSARY
ADVERSE REACTION BY AMSTRUT-2 AT THIS MOMENT.
3. CONCUR REF PARA 1 RE IMPORTANCE OF AMSTRUT-2
CONTINUING TO FEEL OBLIGATION IS BEING HONORED. NEXT MEETING
WITH BARKER, WHICH HOPE TO HAVE NEXT WEEK, PLAN TO SAY THAT
ON BALANCE WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE PROGRAM CONTINUE IN VIEW
PAUCITY PROPAGANDA GOING TO CUBA AGAINST CASTRO. WHILE THERE
:
:
.:
NO OVERRIDING NATIONAL INTEREST, WE CONSIDER IT IMPORTANT BUT
DECISION ON CONTINUATION IS STRICTLY UP TO WNYW. ALSO, PLAN TO
SAY, IF WNYW DECISION IS TO DISCONTINUE PROGRAM, OUR UNDER
STANDING IS THAT AMSTRUT-2 IS A VERY VOLATILE LATIN TYPE AND
WE WOULD ADVISE HANDLING MATTER DIPLOMATICALLY AS POSSIBLE IN
ORDER TO SAVE THEMSELVES FUTURE TROUBLE POSSIBLY
ANY REACTION FROM BARKER AFTER NEXT MEETING
MEETING.
