reported in early
September 1961 that Antin HYCZPORUE received a letter with the
return address: (fru) DIALNAWSKY, 63/H. 7 84. (sic) Philadelphia
23, Pa. The address was also received from an official U.S.
source as 13/8 7 SA. but this is believed to be a typographical
error. It has not been possible to verify the address as the
envelope vsa not photographed but was passed routinely from the
post office to HYCZFORUK. The letter was not tested for secret
writing.
3. The files of this Agency contain no identifiable information
on DIALNAWSKY. It is possible the address should be 631 Horth
Seventh Street, Philadelphia, which is the one used by POHORILIN.
According to information from your Bureau, this is the home of
Dymto WASTLASZUK, Secretary of the Ukrainian Workingmen's
Association and the residence may be used for meetings of that
organization.
4. We would appresiate any information in your files on
DIALNAWSKY..

Attention: Mr. S. J. Papich
FROM: Deputy Director (Plans)
SUBJECT: Semen POHORILIW
Internal Security - R
1. Reference is made to your memorandum of 28 February 1961 on
Subject.
2. We plan to discuss
the receipt by Daytro
GNYP and Antin NYCZYPORUK of the letter containing secret writing
from Subject, who will be identified
only as a resident
of the United States. We believe such a discussion is desirable in
view of ite pertinence to the current investigation of the intelligence
activities of Vasiliy MYAKUSHKO (member of the Soviet delegation to
UNESCO from April 1957 to August 1960). If such a discussion would
adversely affect your interest in POHORILI, please advise us as soon
as possible.
