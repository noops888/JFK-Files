SUBJECT: KAPPES, George Michael
#C 218827
At the request of Mr. Fred Bucci of OS, a review was made of
Subject's file to determine if there is any indication of an alleged
acquaintance between Subject and one DEBORD (phonetic). The inquiry
originated with WH Division who called Mr. Bucci for information because 27
of his past position with with Project JMWAVE. Subject was approved as a Staff
Agent for use in Santo Santo Domingo Domi in January 1968. The Division had heard
a rumor that Subject was acquainted with one DEBORD (phonetic) who was
"close to GARRISON" (District Attorney Jim GARRISON of New Orleans). A
review of Subject's OS file proved negative.
The undersigned also reviewed the security file (#C 241598) of
Lawrence J. LA BORDE whose son, Michael, furnished information to
GARRISON. The results of this review were also negative. (Copy of
summary on LA BORDE prepared for the GARRISON Case is attached).
The only similarity of information in the two files which might
be considered as a possibility only of such acquaintance is as follows:
Subject was employed as a small boat operator with Project JMARC at
Key West, Florida from January to September 1961. Lawrence J. LA BORDE
was granted a Provisional Covert Security Approval in March 1961 for use
as a maritime asset for Project JMATE in the Miami, Florida area.
Mr. Bucci advised he would furnish the undersigned any additional
information that might develop that would involve Subject in the GARRISON
investigation.

SUBJECT: LABORDE, Lawrence J.
(See also ERMING, Gerald Patrick)
ALLEGATION:
Lawrence J. LABORDE, 58
year old former Fort Captain,
visited the New Orleans DCE
office, said he was an ex-CIA
employee and feared GARRISON
would subpoena him. LABORDE's
son, Kichael W. LABORDE, had
furnished GARRISON information.
May be a GARRISON provocation.
CIA CONNECTION:
LABORDE was grantei & Provisional
Covert Security Approval on 24 March 1961
for use as a maritime asset for Project
JMATE. A CSA was deferred pending
receipt of additional bio data on
Subject. On 24 April 1962 clearance
action was cancelled as Subject was
no longer of interest to TFW.
SOURCE:
Visit by Subject to Nev
Orleans DCS office in May 1967
and phoned DCS office in New
Orleans in September 1967.
OS INDICES RESULTS:
4.
Subject's file reflects little bio data and because of this
lack, a request for a CSA on 17 March 1961 for use as a maritime asset
on Project JMATE was deferred until receipt of further information.
A PCSA was granted on 24 March 1961 for assessment of Subject. On
24 April 1962 the request for the CSA was cancelled because he was of
no further interest.
An FBI report of 23 May 1962 said Subject had contacted repre-
sentatives of the Cuban Revolutionary Council in New Orleans, his home
tom; had offered his services; and said he had been running a boat
out of Key West smuggling Cubans and guns with the knowledge of CIA.
A Miani report of June 1962 disclosed that LABORDE had been
exployed by the U. S. Department of Agriculture in Nexico in 1947-1949
but was fired for excessive drinking, discharging unauthorized firearms,
and non-support of dependent children.
The New Orleans STATES-ITE of 23 July 1962 nared Subject as the
source of bitterly anti-CIA remarks and an article in the DENVER POST of
3 June 1962 also appeared to be based on statements from LABORDE.

SCUNCI
AFEI report of August 1962 stated that Subject had duped
certain persons into buying a schooner, the "Elsie Riechart," by
claiming that he and a crew would operate it for Cuban operations
which would be paid for by the U. S. Government, although, the
Government could not openly acknowledge the support.
DETAILS:
When LABORDE visited the New Orleans DCS office on 11 May 1967,
he said he feared that GARRISON would subpoena him and said he was
willing to leave the U. S. to avoid a subpoena and that he wanted
the DCS office to tell him what to do. Subject's visit was believed
to be a provocation by GARRISON in an attempt to entrap CIA into
advising Subject to leave Louisiana. This would have buttressed
GARRISON's charge that CIA and the FBI are attempting to obstruct
the course of justice in New Orleans.
