SUPPLEMENTAL DATA
1. A thermofax copy of MELO's letter is enclosed (with advance copies
of report) for Headquarters only. An electrostatic copy is for-
warded to JMWAVE. It was (HUGLIB-5 who searched MELO and made copies
of the letter. Source also reported that MELO had given his New
York address as 1422, Nelson Avenue, Apt. 6-L, Bronx 59. He gave
MADRIGAL's New York telephone numbers as MO 9-4841 and MO 5-8621.
According to HUGLIB-5. MELO said he is now living in New York.
HUGLIB-5)also reported that on the morning of 3 March Daniel ODUBER'S
chauffeur and Gustavo LORA, a Cuban exile, visited HUGLIB-8 at the
airport and politely asked why MELO had been searched; HUGLIB-801
replied that MELO's movements were of interest to the GOCR.
2.
One possibly significant, unanswered question in this affair is why
MELO was carrying the original of a letter which he presumably had
mailed to Madrigal on or about 9 February.

3. The information re Pinto in the "Costa Rican Service] Comment" is
from (HRS-3837 (source (HUGLIB) which was disseminated as a CSDB.

1. (Field Comment: The following report should be read
in conjunction with TDC3-314/01096-68 (ERB-4065) and
22(1133-4099), which reported that Fernando
Melo Fontanills, a Cuban exile in Costa Rica, was serving as
an intermediary in negotiations between Ludwig Starke Jimenez,
a Costa Rican right-wing extremist, and Rolando Masferrer, a
Cuban exile in the United States who was involved in plotting
against the government of President Francois Duvalier of Haiti.
The negotiations dealt with a plan whereby Starke would pro-
vide a staging area for an invasion of Haiti by Haitian and
Cuban exiles under Masferrer's leadership. Masferrer, if suc-
cessful, would subsequently support a move by Starke against
the Costa Rican Government. Melo was reported to be planning a
trip to New York on 21 February 1968 to talk
with Masferrer and the latter's representative in the negotia-
tions, Father Diego Madrigal Alvarez.)
2. When Melo returned to San Jose on 2 March after
visiting New York City and Miami, Florida, he was detained
and searched by security officials at the airport. Among
Melo's possessions the security officials found a letter,
signed by Melo, addressed to Father Diego Madrigal, New York.
The letter was dated 9 February 1968.* It was typewritten on
letterhead stationery of Rogelio B. Pinto Impresos. (Costa
Rican Service Comment: Melo sells printing equipment and
thus may have a business connection with the Pinto firm;
however, Rogelio Pinto has been reported in the past to have
been involved in plotting against the Costa Rican Government.)
