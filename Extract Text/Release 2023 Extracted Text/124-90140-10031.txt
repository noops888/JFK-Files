1. An official off a Swedish security service has recently requested traces
on the above Subject, who is an applicant for "a position of trust" in Sweden. (5)
We note that this man has been the subject of previous correspondence between
this office and your Bureau, including our SO DB-53386, dated 29 May 1952. He
is the subject of your file number 100-391429 FAI
2. In connection with his inquiry, our Swedish source has furnished the
following biographic data on DE CASTRO, which is possibly merely what DE CASTRO
himself provided to the Swedes:

Swedish Address: c/o RAMBERG, 46 Ostmarksgatan, Harsta ((Stockholm))

Subject studied Russian and other Eastern European languages. While in
Finland, he also taught English. Source did not know what income Subject
had, but wondered how he could manage to make enough money from teaching
English to be able to afford a room costing $40.00 per month, a telephone
and riding lessons, plus the usual normal living expenses.
b. DE CASTRO returned to Sweden, penniless, in about 1958. On a
visit to Helsinki later that year he stated that he had not been able to
find a job in Sweden. During the course of his entire stay in Finland
for about seven years, he gave no indication why he was remaining there
for that length of time and he did not advance himself in any discernible
way. He never visited his mother in England, although he did receive a
visit from his aunt, who is also an Englishwoman.
c. Subject never expressed any political opinions, but his entire
behavior aroused unfavorable speculation as to why he was in Finland.
d. In the summer of 1958 DE CASTRO was hired by Pan American World
Airways to work at the Helsinki Airport, but he was discharged for in-
competence. Subject also was given a job teaching English for the
Tampere (a city in Finland) Finnish-American Society, but lost this
position, too, because of incompetence.
5. Please advise whether the information in paragraph 3 above may be
furnished to the Swedish service which is interested in Subject. We would
also appreciate your advising whether you have received a separate inquiry
from official Swedish sources in this matter.
