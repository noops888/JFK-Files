*Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has been
advised by Special Branch, Jamaica Police Service, that
Evans, a Negro Jamaican national, was picked up at sea in
small boat between Jamaica and Cuba, lost and out of fuel
and food, in September, 1966. He claimed to be in the
process of attempting to rendezvous with unidentified Cubans
with whom he planned to travel to Cuba to collect funds to
be used in the overthrow of the Jamaican Government.
Such
funds were to be used to send organized groups of Jamaicans
to Cuba for training for this purpose. Evans claimed to be.
working with a "syndicate" in the United States which is
to finance a communist revolution in Jamaica. He claimed
this is the same "syndicate" which in the United States
had caused Jack Ruby to kill Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassin
of President Kennedy. Evans further claimed to be enlisting
aid of Jamaican criminal element to organize an extortion
racket to shake down some 100 off-track betting shops in
Jamaica, proceeds from which were to be used in revolution

Memorandum to Mr. W. C. Sullivan
Re: JOHN EVANS
Information furnished concerning Evans indicates
he may well be mentally unbalanced. Despite this, his
claimed connection with a United States "syndicate" which
caused Ruby to kill Oswald and his alleged major involve-
ment in a plan to overthrow the Jamaican Government with
Cuban and "syndicate" assistance along with his indicated
13-year residence in the United States dictate that we
conduct investigation in effort to determine his activities
while in this country. (CIA intends to pass to Special
Branch, Jamaica Police Service, pertinent results of our
inquiries
(U)
Bureau files contain no information identifiable
with Evans. By separate letter, New York and Albany being
instructed to initiate investigation. Other offices covering
Evans' claimed United States residences instructed to review
their files and police and credit records. Pertinent results,
appropriately cleared for passage to Jamaican authorities,
will be furnished to CIA for relay to Jamaica Police Service (U)
ACTION:
None. For information.
