1. While under contract to JKLAVICE from 1958 to February, 1970, LIBUFF/1
accumulated nine creditable quarters under the Social Security winistration (SSA)
system. Eight quarters were accumulated under true name but have not yet been trans-
ferred to SSA. One quarter credited under alias is already posted in the SSA per
Ref. D. With Station approval, Headsuerters intends to transfer the cignt quarters
accumulated under true name to SSA and have sinultarcously the one quarter under alias
berged into the true name account through the intercession of a cleared SSA contact.
LNGLUE would be identified as LIIIUFF/l's employer for all nine quarters, and his
SSA account will not show any JKLANCE interest or connection. The advantage of
this procedure is that after all creditable service and contributions have been
recorded in SSA, LIHUFF/I can correspond directly with SSA on any questions he may have
as to the amounts he is entitled to, etc. JKLANCE will be cut out except if LIBUFF/1
should have any questions on the amount of credit he earned during his JKLANCE service.
In this case, he would have to contact the Station for forwarding his questions to
Headquarters and resolution with appropriate SSA contacts.
2. Following Station action is therefore required:
a.Motify Headquarters that no objection exists to the transfer
outlinelin para 1 above;
b. Brief LINUFF/1 that
(1) his SSA credits are being transferred to SSA for
recording but that their posting may take as long as
six months because of routine posting backlog in SSA;
(2) he should therefore not expect a consolidation of all of his
SSA credits until about the end of calendar year 1970
and should not begin correspondance with SSA until
that time;
(3) since he had earned SSA credits prior to his association with
JALARCE, his spouse should be made aware of his/and/or her
general SSA entitionents without any reference to the
credits accrued curing his JKLANCE service;
(4) after 31 December 1970, he may address any questions concerů-
ing SSA credits and entitlements to:

1. In response to Reference A, the Station notified Headquarters
in Reference B that the $500 monthly subsidy to the LIEUF student
organization would cease as of 30 April 1966. Headquarters believed
that the April subsidy payment reported in Reference C and charged to
Project LIRANCH was to be the last payment.
2. However, in both References D and E, subsidy payments of $500
were again given to the LIHUFF student organization for the months of
August and September. These expenditures were charged to LILISP-X.
The most recent renewal requests for Projects LIHUFF and LILISP-X do
not contain provisions for this subsidy. Headquarters was under the
impression that the subsidy would not be continued and would appre-
ciate the Station's comments.

The Frente Civico Mexicano de Afirmacion Revolucionaria (FCMAR)
ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES
REFERENCE: HMMA-24542, 20 October 1964
1. In reference the Station indicated that unless reference
Identity D succeeded in gaining an important ministerial post in
the new Diaz Ordaz government, the benefits to be derived from
the Cecil B. ARLISS-reference Identity B contact (1.e., а
continuing indirect connection with the Frente Civico and
Incidential information reports) would not be of sufficient
value to warrant continuation of the contact.
2. To date, as far as the Station is aware, reference
Identity D has not been appointed to any Cabinet or sub-minister-
lal position. Further, there is no indication that former
President Aleman intends to re-activate the Frente Civico into
a movement which would be of MHSPAWN interest at this juncture.
3. ARLISS has accordingly been instructed to phase out the
contact with reference Identity B and the Frente Civico upon
his return from his U.S. trip in January 1965. Before lis
departure ARLISS gave reference Identity B an advance of 4000
pesos to cover the two regular monthly payments of 2000 pesos
each for December 1964 and January 1965. When he returns he
will proceed to close out the contact as expeditiously as
possible.

1. The level and the scope of authorized charges to LILISP-X
for LIHUFF activities for the balance of FY64 were provided to you
in Ref B. The Station should adhere rigidly to the limitations on
LIHUFF's salary and the support for student activities. Should
you wish to support other specific projects under LIHUFF activity
such as the book to be published in Buenos Aires, your
recommendations in this respect will be considered by Headquarters
on a case to case basis.
2. As also indicated in Ref B, Headquarters has allocated an
additional $30,000 to Project LILISP-X for FY64 bringing the total
to $82500. This additional allotment will have to be documented
and the Station is asked to submit its comments which can be used
in support of it.
3. The Station is also requested to submit to Headquarters,
not later than 1 June 1964, an up-dated assessment of the LIHUFF
operation. If at that time the Station wishes to present a revised
project for fiscal year 1965, your recommendations should be
submitted with the reassessment. If your recommendations are
accepted, Headquarters will then undertake to rewrite the project
outline forwarded with HMMA-20931 and submit the Project for
approval.
