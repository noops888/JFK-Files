1. References A and B concern reporting by AMBIDDY/1 on
an alleged conspiracy developing in Venezuela among right-wing
members of COPEI to overthrow the LEONI regime. JMWAVE reviewed
the two reports (references) and is forwarding pertinent
information developed for appropriate use by addressees.
2. Reference A paragraph 2 states AMBIDDY/1 said
Venezuelan Major (fnu) GUTIERREZ (Miami representative for
plotters) commutes between Caracas and Miami, and his telephone
number in Miami is 887-0795.
A. The Miami numerical telephone directory lists the
telephone number 887-0795 for Anselmo ALVARADO, 550 Falcon
Ave., Miami Springs, Florida. (For additional WAVE info re one
Anselmo ALVARADO, see Reference D.)
B. Reference C reported that a (fnu) GUTIERREZ,
550 Falcon Ave., Miami Springs; telephone: TU 7-0795 (i.e.,
same number), was listed in the telephone notebook which
belonged to Major Rafael Ange MOLINA Franco when he (MOLINA)
was captured.

3. Reference B states that their (coup group) military
contact is Colonel (fnu) MARTIN Parada. On 30 July 1965
CILAESH/1 reported he had received the following information
on a Colonel (fnu) MARTIN Parada from Major Hugo ARAQUE, a
retired member of P.A.V. (Venezuelan Armed Forces) residing
in Miami, who claims to be a close friend of Colonel MARTIN:
4. (fnu) MARTIN Parada, a retired colonel of the
Venezuelan Armed Forces, arrived from Venezuela on 28 July 1965
aboard a LESCA plane as "an extra passenger", and was staying
at the Hotel DiLido on Miami Beach.
B. ARAQUE said Colonel MARTIN had participated in
several ill-fated uprisings since General Marcos PEREZ Jimenez
was ousted.
C. In 1962 MARTIN was imprisoned and later released
by presidential decree. However, upon his release, he was
dismissed from the Venezuelan Armed Forces.
D. CINARSH/1 commented that from conversations with
ARAQUE, he believes that MARTIN is active in conspiracies supported
by financially strong elements such as Eugenio MENDOZA, who
collaborates with the PCV/FALN in order to protect his interests.
CIHARSH/1 said MENDOZA pays the PCV/FALN for protection as do
many wealthy people in Venezuela.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Chief, WHD for Cuba
SUBJECT:
States of ANCIVIC - AMBIDDY-1
1. The status of the ANCIVIC activity has reached
the point where it must either be made into a useful ongoing
activity or die for lack of purpose and justification.
2. As it now stands the activity's Principal Agent,
AMBIDOY-1, is both literally and figuratively "flaying about"
in a series of half-projects and half-plans which are
neither meaningful to the Agency, meaningful to A-lor
meaningful to his political novement. If he is to be taken
at his word he is currently deeply involved both financially
and politically with General Anastasio Somoza of Nicaragua.
Financially he has committed sons $75,000 of his Movement's
money in a shipbuilding schene supposedly to be established
at Monkey Point, Nicaragua. The plan, as envisioned by A-1,
would be, that upon completion of these shipyards, they would
effer employment and educational opportunities for the
ignorant and poverty stricken Indians of the area. Once
is operation, A-l expects that the profits from this
operation will be ploved back into other endeavors such
as a fishing cooperative and a farming cooperative-also
to ultimately benefit the area's indigenous population.
All of this, of course, kinges upon two fundamental factors:
Firstly, it depends upon the continued goodwill of General
Somosa, together with his willingness to contribute monios
to the previously mentioned scheme. Secondly, it depends to
a lesser oxtont upon A-l's ability to forge ahead with the
program. This ia tuwa hinges upca A-l's financial status
and abilities.
3. is to the first factor, General Somosa has never had
a reputation for benign magnanimity. The facts show quite
the opposite. He has a reputetica for being a hard-headed
self-seeking business/nilitarist who now aspires to political
office. Anyone who cau help obviously receives his support..
٢١
SECRET

-3-
Therefore, should A-l's project noot with success, Somoка
would benefit both financially and politically. It is
difficult to imagine A-l deriving the same advantages
especially when added to these considerations, is the fact
that they have nothing whatever to do with Cuba or Cubans.
4. As to the second factor, and returning to the more
realistic aspects of the problem, A-l in the past has demon-
strated his ability to sell ideas and projects. In a word
he is a politician. However, when it comes to administrative,
business and financial matters he is singularly inept. This
vas amply demonstrated during the AMWORLD era when it was
only thanks to the efforts of other well-qualified people
that the project was ever able to sustain itself. In
summary, as it now stands. A-l is in the position of being
wholly beholden of the good offices of General Somoка..
Be further derives no political advantages from this and
is engaged in projects for which he has no basic qualifications.
In a sense he is leading with his weakest card. More
seriously, his efforts are politically out of focus.
:
8. The above presents an admittedly gloomy picture of
A-1 and his current activities, however, there are certain.
aspects of the situation which might be used in order to
rechannel A-l's efforts. For one, A-1 claims that his
sagasino Tridente is now running in the black (this, of course,
comes from A-1 who probably has difficulty distinguishing an
ammet from a liability). Secradly, be has purchased 22 acres
of land in West Palm Beach where be is supposedly to start
training Nicaraguan Indians in the complexities of cooperative
farming. Both of these endeavors represent the positive and
realistic side of A-1's program. They also represent, or
could represent, his Cuban efforts instead of his Nicaraguan
efforts. Instead of Nicaraguan Indians, A-l should be
concentrating on training Cuban exiles. Using the proceeds
fron the two Swift launches, he should expand the acreage
of his fara to the point of possibly making it a self-sustaining
show place for his cooperative students. In so doing he would
be rafecusing bia political efforts while at the same time
inproving his Cuban image. From the Agency's point of vice
it could also be more easily supervised.
6. It is therefore requested that the undersigned be
allowed to sit down with A-l and point out the folly of his
current activities and attempt to refocus them along the lines
mentioned above. Should he accept these suggestions further
efforts vould then be made to encourage A-l to hire a
SECRET
14-0000
-4-
coapetent businessman to supervise his financial affairs.
Further, once located (preferably by us) future support
payments vould be made to the business manager instead of
to A-l, with stricter accounting and double-checking
involved. It would also be suggested that less security
would be observed and more direct looking into A-1 business
would be the order of the day. As such, it is also
recommended that the undersigned be allowed to actually
visit the farm and report back on the actual status of the
farm. A-1 would also be told that henceforth, except on
FI collection missions, he should confine his efforts to
the farn and developing a sensible program for cooperativu
training of Cubans, not Nicaraguans, or any other nationals.
7. In summary A-1 should be told that unless he is
prepared to refocus his activities more realistically the
Agency's gravy train is about to pull into the station.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation with AMBIDDY-101
1. AMBIDDY-1 telephoned the undersigned and indicated
that he was forced to postpone his projected interview with
President Raul Leoni of Venezuela due to the latter's having
a tight schedule. As it now stands, A-l plans to travel to
Venezuela within ten days for the projected meeting.
2. A-1 stated that he was in contact with Costa Rican
Presidential candidate, Daniel Oduber, during his last visit.
Oduber supposedly asked for A-l's assistance in trying to
overcome a recent spate of rumors surrounding his (Oduber's)
allegiance with Communists. (Note: A-l is already printing
some of Oduber's campaign material, so presumably this request
falls within the context of the general propaganda discussions
which A-l and Oduber held).
3. A-1 was asked if he had picked up any further informa-
tion on the "mysterious Italian" which he reported on during
his previous Costa Rica visit. He said that he had not but
that his local representative in San Jose had been given
instructions to try in every way possible to develop further
information on the man. As an aside, A-1 stated that he had
discussed the matter with the Chief of the Costa Rican
Security Service. More specifically, A-l asked that if by
chance his own men located the individual, whether the Costa.
Rican Service would mind if he "transported" the man across
the border to Nicaragua where they would be better able to
deal with him. He claimed that the chief offered no objections
to this plan. The undersigned cautioned A-1 ca any interna-
tional "transporting" schemes.
4. From Costa Rica, A-l traveled to Nicaragua where he
held a meeting with Anastasio Somoza. The discussion centered
on A-1's scheme for setting up a shipbuilding and dry dock
facility near Monkey Point. In the course of this discussion,
A-l claims to have obtained an offer from the GON for the
SECRET
14-0000
-2-
SECRET
financing of the shipyard in the amount of $125,000. A-1
claims that this amount, coupled with his own contribution
of $75,000, should be enough to begin construction of the
facility as well as a school for teaching the indigenous
people of the area how to read and write in addition to
acquiring a skill in shipbuilding and repairing.
5. As for politics, A-l stated that Somoza was definitely
not interested in embroiling himself with the Guatemalan and
Costa Rican coup planners such as Roberto Alejos Arzu and
Miguel Ruiz Herrera. The main reason for this was his concern
with his own campaign in Nicaragua. Someca, however, admitted
to A-l that he had given some money to Guatemalan Col. Ponciano
in order that the latter would be able to start his electoral
campaign in Guatemala. A-l emphasized that the money was in-
tended to support a legal campaign within the framework of
the current constitutional and electoral laws and not for
support of the extra-legal efforts of Alejos and company.
6. As an item of incidental interest, A-l, while in
Costa Rica, met with Roberto Madrid, the current Secretary to
the Costa Rican President (possibly Secretary to the future
President). Madrid in the past had been most helpful to
AMBIDDY-1's movement in Costa Rica. By coincidence, Madrid
was on his way to Miami for a one-week vacation so that A-1
invited him to stay at his house and attend his daughter's
baptism. Madrid and his wife, therefore, are current AMBIDDY-1
house guests.
7. Finally, the undersigned queried AMBIDDY-1 on whether
he had been successful in obtaining a Nicaraguan passport
for AMJAVA-4 in order that the latter might proceed with his
plans for enrolling in the University of Mexico. A-1 replied
that the passport was issued by the GON and would be mailed
direct to A-4 within the next week or two.

1. Transmitted herewith are tape recordings of talks
which have been taped by AMBIDDY-I at the request of Head-
quarters for possible re-broadcast into Cuba. As originally
conceived, it was thought that AMBIDDY-1 would firstly set
forth in broad terms reasons for his talks and then proceed
through a series of short speeches to address various political
and. economic groups within Cuba - such as the "becados" and
the Military elements. In each case the overall theme would
be to appeal to the basic patriotic emotions of the various
social groups and then contrast this patriotism with the
current regime which has not only betrayed the ideals of genuine
social justice but has betrayed the nation itself.
2. It is therefore requested that the Station review
the attachments, which have been submitted on a pilot basis,
and that any suggestions and/or comments regarding their usage
be forwarded to Headquarters for further consideration. Please
also include views on what Radio Station would be most appro-
priate for the broadcasts.
