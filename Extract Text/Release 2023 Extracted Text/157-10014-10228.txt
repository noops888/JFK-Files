that in late July or early August of 1960 in attended a meeting in the Pentagon in which
the overall Congo problem was discussed. He state: "During the discussion, which covered
a great variety of matters, my recollection is that a question regarding a possibility of
an assassination attempt against Lamumba was briefly raised. The CIA representative indi-
cated that the agency did not undertake this sort of operation. This ended consideration
of this subject. With this one exception I never heard any discussion of assassination
attempts against anyone."

BISSELL said that the initiative probably came from himself. (55) BISSELL emphasizes

BISSELL testified that he "very definitely" (p. 75) asked
O'DONNELL to investigate the possibility of killing
LUMUMBA.
BISSELL said that this could be an example of Executive
Action capability but when pressed on the contradiction
between the dates of late 1960 for his conversation with
O'DONNELL and May 1961 (or early 1961) for his establishment
of the Executive Action capability, he said that he did not
remember whether his assignment assignme to O'DONNELL was part of the
Executive Action program. (p. 76).

that Mobutu would remain in the background."
Mr. Merchant reported on discussions with Hammarskjold: "He has swung away

BISSELL said that the philosophy described by the Chief of the CIA Africa Division, probably
BRONSON TWEEDY, in a memorandum in late 1960, was probably applicable to matters within the
scope of Project ZRRIFLE. The memorandum recommended the agent WIROGUE in these terms:
"He is indeed aware of the precepts of right and wrong, but if he is given an assignment,
which may be morally wrong in the eyes of the world, but necessary because his case officer
ordered him to carry it out, then it is right, and he will dutifully undertake appropriate
action for its execution without pangs of conscience. In a word, he can rationalize all
actions" (59).

"My judgment is that before Mr. O'DONNELL ever got there,

that the virus appeared in view of Mr. O'DONNELL's position
of refusing to assassinate a leader.

HELMS was serving as BISSELL's number two man, Chief of Operations. HELMS testified that
he would not necessarily have known about the poison if it had been sent to the Congo
