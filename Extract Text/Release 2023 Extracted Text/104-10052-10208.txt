PROJECT LIENVOY RENEWAL
A. CURRENT OBJECTIVES
24
The LIENVOY Project provides for a (joint KUBARK-Mexican Government sponsored)
telephone tap unit and for(a for a non-official liaison relationship with access to24
the highest ranking government officials of Mexico. The tap unit provides
direct support necessary to cover targets and operational programs levied on the
Mexico Station via the RMD as well as spot requests from Headquarters and other
Stations. This Project also produces positive intelligence.
B. CHANGES
(1) Operational Mechanism
A
The LIENVOY Project was created in late late(1958)and and put into operation in
early (1959) at the request of (LITENSOR) who appointed LIELEGANT as his special 01,024
assistant) to work with Willard C. CURTIS in the supervision and administration of
the project. In mid-1964 it became evident that (LIRAMA would replace LITENSOR) LITENSOR) in² 4
December 1964. (LIRAMA was then LITEMPO-2 and a clandestine liaison contact with
Willard C. CURTIS under the LITEMPO Project but was not knowledgeable of the
CURTIS/LIELEGANT/LITENSOR relationship in Project LIENVOY.) On 10 August 1964
24
01.01 (LIRAMA (LITEMPO-2)) asked CURTIS and LIELEGAND for a conference (reported to Head-
quarters in MEXI-0521 dated 10 August 1964). At this meeting (LIRAMA advised that
ol (LITENSOR) had briefed him on the LIENVOY Project in detail and that it should be اد
continued with the same personnel and manner of operation. CHELEGANT) and (LIENVOY-2)
have been given nominal positions which provide cover for daily reports to (LIRAMA
31 Government credentials) are also being provided for Staff Agent Arnold F. AREHART
and the local agents working in the LP. LIRAMA) has requested that the LP remain
in its present location and has provided a credential for the inside of the front
doorway which prohibits entry to anyone without special permission obtained from 24
his office)
(2) Agents
During the last project year there have been no changes in the agent
personnel. For the information of reviewing officials there is enclosed as
Attachment-l, a chart listing current LIENVOY targets as well as functions of
LIENVOY agents. Arnold F. AREHART, Staff Agent, has been responsible for mainten-
ance of the technical equipment for the past five years. His work continues to
be outstanding and accounts for the fact that after almost six years' use, the
equipment is in good working order and has sustained a minimum of loss through
negligent breakage or theft (both very common in Mexico). There has been no major
mechanical breakdown since AREHART has been supervising the maintenance of the
equipment.
C. INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTION
While telephone tap operations are commonly classified as "support operations",
the LIENVOY Project by nature of some of its targets, has produced considerable
۱۹

positive intelligence. It has been reviewed both at Headquarters and in the
Mexico Station as one of the most productive telephone tap projects in KUBARK
of both FI and CI/CE information.
(1) FI information. From 1 February 1964 through 31 December 1964, this
project was the source of 240 positive reports. The general subject categories
within which these reports fall as related to objectives of the most recent RMD
(HMMS-3190 dated 21 October 1963) are:
Priority A. 1, 2, 3, and Priority B. 1, 2, and 4.
Cuban Embassy Activities in Mexico
Soviet Embassy Activities in Mexico

strategy
in domestic and foreign affairs
Acti Activity of Mexican Government with regard to intentions and strategy
Communist Party of Mexico (PCM) Activities in Mexico
Communist Front Activities (Movimiento Liberacion Nacional - MLN) in
Mexico
Activities of Communist, Leftist, (or outspoken Anti-PBPRIME political 24
figures)
Activities of Communist China representatives in Mexico
(2) CI/CE information. In addition to the general subject categories of
FI interest, the LIENVOY Project fulfills a standing requirement to provide
CI/CE data on the following selected targets: Cuban Embassy - six lines; Soviet
Embassy five lines; Czech Embassy - two lines; Polish Embassy - 2 lines;
Yugoslav Embassy - two lines (disconnected in April 1964); and the Communist
Chinese News Agency (NCNA) - one line (being installed as of January 1965).
D. EFFECTIVENESS
(1) From 1 February 1964 through December 1964 (eleven months) the LIENVOY
Project covered a total of 30 (thirty) targets simultaneously which provided
7,462 reels of raw take. This was processed into 21,564 pages of transcripts
(of this amount actual count by LIENVOY processors was 17,064 pages, an estimate
by the outside Czech translator was 1,500 pages, Russian translator 2,000 pages,
and Polish translator 1,000). Enclosed as Attachment-2 is a copy of the work
load log and list of targets which Arnold F. AREHART provides the Station on a
monthly basis. This log, of course, includes only the work done inside the LP
and variance of monthly figures is accounted for by additional work done by other
Station (unilateral) translators.
24
(2) (a) (Mexican) Targets. Of the 30 lines covered, 15 of them are always
exclusively for KUBARK. The remaining targets are selected by (LIRAMA) but are
usually of interest to KUBARK as sources of positive intelligence. The (Mexican
"targets covered during the past project year were:

(b) KUBARK Targets. The Mexico Station CI/CE requirement is partially
fulfilled by LIENVOY which during the past project year covered the telephone
lines of the Cuban Embassy, Soviet Embassy, Czech Embassy, Polish Embassy, Yugoslav
Embassy, and made preliminary installation for the Communist Chinese News Agency
(NCNA). There follows selected significant examples of the LIENVOY product from
each of these targets with a Station appraisal of its effectiveness.
1. Cuban Embassy. The six lines covered are:
14 42 37
The Ambassador's private telephone
25 07 95
The Chancery
14 13 26
The Chancery
25 09 14
The Commercial Office
11 28 47
The Consulate
25 07 77
Elena Vasquez Gomez
The Chancery and Consulate lines regularly identify foreigners in
Mexico who contact the Cuban Embassy. Expeditious processing of
the transcripts frequently permits the Station to arrange for
unilateral surveillance and identification of other contacts. The
Commercial Office coverage provides information on Cuban Commercial
activities in Mexico and identification of firms dealing with Cuba.
The Elena Vasquez Gomez target has been of interest in connection
with the AMROD operation. The AMROD Headquarters Case Officer, Thomas
SECRET/KAPCK
14-00000
SECRET/KAPCK
-5-
G. URQUHART (ps), presently in Mexico on temporary duty has
provided the Station with the following evaluation of the LIENVOY
product: "The LIENVOY production on the Cuban Embassy traffic in
Mexico City has been one of the basic elements contributing to the
success of the AMROD operation, directed against the CUIS for CA
purposes. The LIENVOY operation has been of value in two general
senses: a. The documentary material derived from the texts has
formed some of the basis for reconstruction of historical facts
needed for the operation. b. The day to day coverage has enabled
the case officer on the AMROD operation to sense the climate inside
the target, to keep track of the movements of key opposition personnel,
to check on the bona fides of certain agents, to check the work of
others for veracity and to live monitor portions of the reactions
to the AMROD operation itself. Being able to keep track of the
shifts and movements of the opposition and their personal relations
has been of vital importance to this operation. On two occasions
the AMROD Case Officer also used the LIENVOY base as his command
post when engineering personal contacts between a KUBARK staffer
and the opposition. This type of close support did much to determine
the success of those meetings and contributed greatly to the success
of the operation. These transcripts provide one of the best sounding
boards for the AMROD operation and are regularly forwarded to me at
Headquarters."
The
The six lines above are fully transcribed by LIENVOY transcribers
and delivered by AREHART to RIGGS each morning. Lengthy conversa-
tions sometimes require an additional day for transcription. A
carbon copy is pouched weekly to Headquarters for WH/SA use.
original is retained by the Mexico Station. A third copy is retained
in the intercept center chronological files. (LIRAMA) does not read
these transcripts unless some significant item appears in the
resumen" which causes him to ask for a fuller transcript or listen
to the tape.
The coverage of this target also yields a good picture of daily
activities, residences, personal habits and weaknesses of Cuban
official personnel in Mexico. This is used by Station Case Officers
in selection of targets for recruitment and in checking on activities
of agents already recruited and either working for or in contact
-with Embassy officials.
2. Soviet Embassy. The Soviet Government has over fifty officials
permanently stationed in Mexico (the largest foreign embassy except
for the U.S.). Thirty-four of these Soviets (almost 70 percent of
the staff) are known or suspect intelligence officers. The five
lines under LIENVOY provide details on the activities of most of
these Soviets. The lines are:
SECRET/KAPCK
14-00000
SECRET/KAPCK
-6-
15 60 55 Soviet Consulate and Chancery. This line is used by
fifteen (15) known or suspect KGB officers. It is also
used by foreigners in Mexico attempting to make contact with
the Soviets. When contacts suggest clandestine meetings, the
Station arranges for unilateral surveillance and has had
some success in identifying contacts.
15 61 55 Soviet Chancery. This line is used primarily by the Ambassador
and provides more information on protocol contacts than leads
of intelligence interest. However, it gives the Station a
picture of the personalities being cultivated by Soviet
diplomats and of Mexicans who are seeking contacts with the
Soviets.
15 61 07 Soviet Commercial Office. Four (4) known or suspect GRU
officers use this number. They are Military intelligence
officers using Commercial Office cover and in some instances
actually perform commercial functions of trade negotiations
but the volume of trade between Mexico and the USSR does
not justify a Commercial Office staff of eight (8) Soviets.
This produces some information useful to check on double
agent operations run by the Station against the GRU officers.
In addition, the LIENVOY product usually identifies the
GRU officers as escorts for trade, scientific, commercial,
and tourist delegations who now are constantly on trips
from the USSR to Mexico. LIENVOY also provides details of
the itineraries of these groups once they arrive in Mexico.
15 12 64 Soviet Films Office. This leads into the residence and
office of Vladimir Petrovich OBRUBOV, a suspect GRU officer,
who distributes Soviet Commercial Films in Mexico. There
have been several calls from what appear to be Central
Americans but the Station has not been successful in identify-
ing the callers or determining the nature of the calls.
15 69 87 Soviet Military Attache. This is the least productive of
the coverage simply because the Soviet Military officers
either won't answer the telephone or spend very little time
where it rings. Nevertheless, U.S. AWOL servicemen try
this number to make contact. There are three GRU colonels
and six (6) civilian GRU officers who use this line.
The Soviet information is transcribed by the LIENVOY transcribers in
the same way as the Cuban traffic except that the transcripts are
delivered daily with the reels from which an outside translator
(Douglas J. FEINGLASS) transcribes the Russian conversations into
English. These Russian conversations are of considerable value and
it is apparent that the Soviets are not aware that these conversations
are being overheard and understood. There have been conversations
identifying code room personnel; one conversation between two Soviet
children revealed the entire layout of the Soviet Commercial Office;
personality clashes and grievances are also aired.

In June 1964 the SR Division. made available personnel for temporary
duty in Mexico to analyze and collate personality and background
data collected by LIENVOY but which had accumulated in Station
files on Soviet officials. These Soviet Personality Reports (SPR)
should be useful on a world-wide basis as Soviet officials are
transferred from post to post, in providing the KUBARK representative
with a summary of the Soviet's past work pattern, intelligence
activities as far as known, physical description, weaknesses, and
vulnerability toward recruitment by a Western service. Not all but
a large percentage of this data is received from LIENVOY.
3. Czech Embassy. Two lines in the Chancery (45-30-91 and 45-30-12)
are covered by LIENVOY. Reels from these targets are delivered
daily by AREHART to RIGGS who delivers them to the EE Case Officer
who arranges for transcription and translations to be done by David
B. SCHLAGHTER, field contract agent. This agent also prepares a
monthly summary of information on the activities of Czech officials
in Mexico. During September 1964 LIENVOY revealed important informa-
tion on the establishment of a factory equipped with Czech machinery
to produce dyes in Mexico (ANYL MEX). In addition to the significance
of this information in assessing Czech economic activities in Mexico,
there was operational benefit in dealing with (DISOBER, a Czech
official on temporary duty in Mexico in connection with the opening
of this factory.
4. Polish Embassy. LIENVOY covers one line (11 25 49) in the main
Chancery which produces data on the activities of Polish officials
stationed in Mexico. The second line (25 82 38) is the private line
of Polish Commercial Counselor, Czeslaw SLOWAKIEWIEZ, in whom the
Mexico Station has a definite operational interest (as a recruitment 24
target Reels (without transcripts) from these targets are delivered
daily by AREHART to RIGGS who delivers them to the EE Case Officer
who arranges for translations and transcriptions to be done by Norma
Q. RYMINSKY, a contract employee.
5. Yugoslav Embassy. During part of the project year LIENVOY
covered two lines in this Embassy. The lines were disconnected by
LIENVOY in April 1964 and transferred to LIFEAT The reason for
this termination was to conceal interest in (DMPETAL, an agent recruited)
as a result of a follow-up of a lead supplied through LIENVOY coverage.
During the time this target was covered, LIENVOY transcribers provided
transcriptions of the Spanish conversations. The reels were then
delivered to Victor W. OBOLD, a career agent who provided translations.
6. Communist China News Agency (NCNA). On 18 December 1964 Willard
C. CURTIS briefed LIRAMA on the presence in Mexico of representatives
ol of Communist China using journalist cover for an intelligence mission.
(LIRAMA) agreed to install LIENVOY coverage of this line and (share the 24
take with the Mexico Station). This will be a (Mexican line and 24
replace the present coverage of the D.F.S. The Station hopes to use
this information to influence (LIRAMA) LIRAMA) to to declare these persons persona
non grata. LIFEAT has been taken off of this target.

In summary, the Station Case Officers responsible for established FI
and CI/CE programs feel that LIENVOY has made a very necessary intelligence
support contribution. It should be noted that LIENVOY facilities during the
project year produced about three times the volume of raw audio take as that
produced by LIFEAT over the same length of time at approximately one half the
cost. This is possibly due to the centralized tapping and transcribing facilities
of LIENVOY as compared with the widely scattered ones of LIFEAT. LIENVOY (as a 24
liaison tap operation) is able to tap any phone desired whereas LIFEAT, (as a 24
unilateral operation, must take greater security precautions. The Chief of
Station Mexico feels that the success of Station Mexico's operational program
against the Cuban, Soviet and Soviet Satellite installations and personnel in
Mexico is largely attributable to the continuous and thorough coverage of these
targets provided by LIENVOY. COS recommends that the project be renewed for
another year as an essential collection and support operation for the Mexico
Station.
E. PROBLEMS
There have been no significant security, cover, control, or liaison problems
during the project year.
24
F. (LIAISON
24
This Project continues to encompass (an unofficial liaison relationship with
high-level Mexican government officials and contributes to the friendly attitude
of these officials toward ODYOKE.
Some examples are:
)
9
a). In January 1964 CURTIS met with (LITENSOR) to discuss Communist China and
was told by (LITENSOR) that the Mexican Government would not recognize Red China 24
during his administratio
administration).
이
b). CURTIS had several meetings with LIELEGANT)au
during April 1964 when
LIELEGANT provided information from LITENSOR) on Communist agitation throughout
Mexico.
이
이
اه
c). In August 1964 CURTIS and (LIELEGANT) met with (LIRAMA) to discuss the
continuation of the LIENVOY Project.
d). In September 1964 CURTIS at the request of Chief, PESWING, saw (LIRA LIRAMA) to
deliver an invitation to visit the home of GPLOGIC. Several other meetings were.........
held between CURTIS and (LIRAMA) prior to this trip.
10
e). On 7 November 1964 Chester D. DAINOLD and Cedric B. PAPATE accompanied
CURTIS to a meeting with (LIRAMA) where DAINOLD and PAPATE gave briefings on the
Cuban situation and on Latin America. Full details of these briefings were
reported to Headquarters in HMMA-24700 RYBAT dated 9 November 1964.

f). On 9 December 1964 (LIRAMA) asked CURTIS for assistance(in providing a
special ink for the exclusive use of LIRAMA in signing important documents.)
Headquarters KURIOT fulfilled this request (by supplying the ink and sending 24
a specialist to Mexico to instruct LIRAMA in its use)
g). On 16 December 1964 CURTIS met with (LIRAMA) and provided him with
information on Cuban Embassy activities and association with members of Mexican
universities, Personalities in the S.N.T.E. and, pro-Cuban associations, Capture
of guerrillas, arms and documents in Guatemala, Chinese Communists in Mexico, and
Communist Activities in Chihuahua. Copies of information given to (LIRAMA were
pouched to Headquarters.
G. INTER-AGENCY COORDINATION.
01
No formal coordination is required in this Project. Chief, PBSWING, Mexico,
is the only ODYOKE official in Mexico outside KUBARK who is aware of this project
and its provision for a special channel to LIRAMA Special briefings are cleared
with PBSWING before KUBARK representatives meet with (LIRAMA CURTIS advises Chief,
PBSWING of significant and pertinent subjects which are discussed in meetings
between CURTIS and (LIRAMA)
H. PLANS.
이
The Station plans to continue the intercepto program without change for the
next project year. As previously noted, (LIRAMA has asked that the project
continue without a change in personnel or in the manner of operation.
I. FUNDS.

On two occasions during the Project year, the Station requested KURIOT
assistance in making a technician available for temporary duty replacement for
Arnold F. AREHART. Newton T. RUTSAY came to Mexico in May and September 1964
to supervise the tap center and maintain the equipment. The Headquarters
support furnished this project was timely and commendable.
K. EMERGENCY CONDITIONS.
There has been no change in emergency conditions arrangements since the
