FIELD COMMENTS
A) Re Watts/Bem telecon, 10 September
1974.
B) The meeting took place the morning
of 7 September 1974 in Miami. Joe Merola
telephoned Matt MacVane at his home on
7 September 1974 to pass on this informa-
tion. The telecon was unsolicited by
MacVane, who no longer contacts Merola
per DCD Headquarters instructions. Com
Robinson flew in from Nassau to meet with
Joe Merola and Mike Yamanis (Yamanis is
apparently from Ft. Lauderdale and like
Merola he has close ties to arms dealers
and mercenaries). Robinson plans to meet
again with Merola and Yamanis after com-
plete financial details have been worked
out in Nassau.
