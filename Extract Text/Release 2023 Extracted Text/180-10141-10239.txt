William Crawford, former executive officer
of the CIST station at Atsugi, Japan
Concerning his knowledge of LHO and
The military intelligence that LHO may
have possessed from his military congruent
as Radio-radar operator of the Atsugi
Naval Base.
Crawford advised that he didn't
know LHO and never heard the name
until after the assassination of J F K.
The U-2 program administered by
the CIST at Atsugi didn't have
their own radio radar facilities. The
U-2 planes utilized the naval base
communications for only for take-off
and landing clearance.
The CIA employees at Atsugi
had no clandestine activities other than
the U-2 program. All

intelligence were handled
by case officers stationed
else where [in Japan].
The cover story for the U-2 plane
at Atsugi was that it was used to
monitor radio activity in the area. In
fact the plane actually bore equipment
installed to measure radio activity.
The U-2 seemed to facilitate the cover story. When
Oswald would have take-off and land at the base however
he would have no other information.
Radar operators would not be able
to trace the U-2 flights. The
plane would take off in the opposite
direction. The U-2 would fly to a
staging area (Peshawar, Pakistan)
before going into the flight plan for the
over flight of the Russian. The Russians
were aware of the over flights from
the beginning of the program in 1955.
The Russians didn't have the ability
to shoot the U-2 down at the altitude
of the U-2 flight.
The CIA recruited personnel for
the program from the military.
The pilots would resign from their
respective service units with the
understanding that at the completion

of the mission they would go
back without losing service time
and at an equivalent. The
contemporaries all
program employees were paid by
CIA. General maintenance.
The U-2 was provided at Atsugi
however major overhaul was
made only in U.S.
Although the program was
directed and administered by the
CIA, the commander of the Atsugi
program was Col. Wharton "Hack"
Mixon from the air force.
The program was terminated
in 1960.
