SUBJECT: Jose Jose Antonio CASAS Roda
DATE OF CONTACT : 2 May 1963 (2000 to 2345 Hours);
4 May 1963 (0900 to 1300 Hours).
1. On 1 May 1963 I travelled to Harrisburg. Pennsylvania.
and attempted to contact Subject at his home at
at 1930 hours. Subject's son answered the door and advised that his
father was out for the evening and wasn't expected to return till 2200
hours. At 2200 hours I returned to Subject's home to be advised that
he had not yet returned but was expected momentarily. In view of the
late hour, I requested the son tell his father that a representative of
the United States Government had called and wished to speak to him on
matters pataining to the situation in Cuba. I Indicated I would return
about 2000 hours on 2 May.

3. At 2000 hours on 2 May I called at Subject's home and found
him present. He was friendly and courteous, requesting that I come
into the home where I was introduced to his wife and several of his six
Children. He requested to see my KUBARK identification which he gave
only a cursory glance before returning to me. He then indicated his
complete willingness to supply any information known to him on the Cuban
situation and personalities,
3. Subject and his wife make an excellent impression. They
proceeded to put ma at ease, offered coffee, and generally showed them-
selves to be excellent extroverted hosts. The subsequent conversation
lasted until approximately 2345 hours and was somewhat general in nature,
Basically we rebashed information already provided by Subject during
his debriefing by U. S. authorities in Miami and already reflected in his
201 file. Subject was rather difficult to debrief in that his English is
somewhat fractured and he is extremely disorganized in his thoughts,
Ha bas à tendency to develop one theme which in turn will remind him

of a second, also of interest, which he will proceed to discuss to the
confusion of the first. This problem was perhaps compounded by the
fact that Subject was uncertain as to the type of information of interest
to KUBARK. He grasped quickly, however, he type of information
which would be of most interest to us and it rapidly became less difficult
to get to the meat of the subject we were discussing. Further contact
and debriefing of him will become progressively less difficult.
4. We are consolidating the information obtained from Subject
from our two meetings with him on 2 and 4 May below for reporting
convenience.
5. Basically Subject is able to supply specific information of
interest on only five personalities. He knows and was acquainted with
many other personalities in the Cuban government, but his relationship
with them is not close enough to enable him to provide information in
sufficient detail or depth to allow valid assessment as to their suscep-
tibility to a recruitment or other operational approach.
6. Information on five Cuban government officials, well known
to Subject is set forth below:
a. Esubio AZCUE, born about 1912, is presently
employed as a consul at the Cuban Embassy in Maxico
City. AZCUE is a long time friend of Subject. They met
during the mid-1950's when both were involved in revolu-
tionary activities attempting to bring about a democratic
socialist regime in Cuba. AZCUE is married to a Spanish
woman and was involved in the Spanish revolution. He
was a very close friend of Manolo CASTRO who was
reportedly murdered by a group of Communist left wing
revolutionaries which included Fidel CASTRO. About,
1962 AZCUE was living in France and is believed to have
been arrested by French authorities on charges resulting
from his involvement in smuggling penicillin and other
antibiotics into France. Subject believes that AZCUE has
about five children. During early 1901 while in Mexico
City, AZCUE was contacted by Subject in order to obtain
advice re the advisability of his defecting from the Castro
regime and requesting political asylum in Mexico. As a

result of this contact Subject obtained the impression that
AZCUE is suffering from a lack of funds. Since AZCUE
is somewhat of a snob and a fancy dresser, he finds this
situation unpleasant. AZCUE also habitually has a mis-
tress which in turn is a drain on his pocketbook.
(1) According to Subject, AZCUE is an
excellent draftsman who studied architecture
at the University of Habana, although he never
obtained a degree. Subject assesses him as a
kind man, very happy-go-lucky, but impetuous
and one who "blows with the wind". He doesn't
seem to have the powers of concentration or of
single purpose which would allow him to be suc-
cessful. Subject feels that AZCUE has appended
himself to the Castro regime since it offers him
a purpose in life and a feeling of belonging to
something.
(2) Subject described AZCUE as being a
very brave man. He felt that should AZCUE be
approached by LUBARK and requested to coop-
erate, the physical danger inherent to in-place
agent work would not affect his decision. In
summary there would be a reasonable chance of
persuading AZCUE to cooperate with KUBARK I
a suitable monetary and ideological inducement
were offered him. Subject feels, on the basis of
their 1961 conversations in Mexico City, that
AZCUE is not too enthused about the Castro regime.
and it is possible he has become even less in
favor of it during the ensuing period.
(3) Subject appended that it would be helpful
in any approach to AZCUE to attempt to convince
hin that Fidel CASTRO was directly involved in
tho "gangster" revolutionary group responsible for
Manolo CASTRO's murder, AZCUE was a very
chowo iriond of Manolo CASTRO's and was affected
greatly by his death.

b. Enrique RODRIGUEZ Loeches: RODRIGUEZ was
born about 1912 and is presently Cuban Ambassador to
Morocco. RODRIGUEZ was involved for a long time in
revolutionary attempts to overthrow the BATISTA and pre-
vious regines in Cuba. He was with CASTRO during the
1958-59 period in the Sterra Maestre. Subject became
acquainted with and a close friend of HODRIGUEZ when
both were members of the same so-called revolutionary
"Directorio". Subject alleges that HODRIGUEZ tas dis-
liked CASTRO since their first meeting during the 1958-59
period. Both Subject and his wife alleged to have received
a letter from RODRIGUEZ written in the Sierra Maestre
in which he listed his dislike of CASTRO and among other
things referred to hinı using the Spanian equivalent of the
term 'dirty prostitute". Subject advised that unfortunately
this letter has been destroyed. Subject is convinced that
if he met RODRIGUEZ on the street tomorrow the latter
would have no compunctions about sitting down for a long
discussion on old times as well as the political situation.
in Cuba. Subject is also convinced that he could on friendly
terms "talk defection or recruitment" with RODRIGUEZ
should they have the opportunity to meet.
c. Orlando BLANCO, born about 1922, is married to
a woman of Puerto Rican birth which makes her an American
Citizen. BLANCO, according to the latest information avail-
able to KUBARK, is stationed with the Cuban Embassy in
Morocco with the rank of counselor. Subject met BLANC
when the latter became subordinate to him in the revolu-
tionary "Directorio" working towards the overthrow of the
Eatinia regime. Despite BLANCO's revolutionary activities,
Subject assesses him as being relatively passive politically.
Both BLANCO and his wife are believed to have applied for
employment with the Cuban foreign service as a means of
leaving Cuba. Subject feels it is possible they will not return
to Cuba when their tour in Morocco expires. During 1960-61
BLANCO was employed in the National Bank of Cuba. During
this period Subject obtained the impression that BLANCO
had become anti-Castro. Subject, however, assesses BLANCO
as a non-courageous type of individml who might be iright-
ened at the idea of working as an in-place agent. As an

example of BLANCO's lack of courage, Subject cited the
fact that he and his wife attempted to avoid Subject's wife
while Subject was an asylee in the Argentine Embassy in
Habana. Incidentally, BLANCO's wife's name is Isabelle
LAGO de Bianco and she is on excellent terms with Subject' 08
wife Sabject is apparently convinced that BLANCO would
welcome an opportunity to meet with him providing he wes
sssured that the fact of the meeting would not become known
to his Cuban superiors.
d. Faure CHOMON :ediavilla (201-270370): In ea-
sonco Subject was only able to reiterate the background
Information on ClioMON outlined in paragraph 5 of UFCW
1674, 13 January 1903. In order to place his relationship
with CHOMON in perspective, Subject produced a personal
letter to him from CHOMON which was written in January
1969 and referred to Subject in the most familiar of terms.
Subject alleged that CHOMON bas confided in him on many
matters of personal and political nature for many years.
As an example, he cited a difficulty in which CHOMON
became involved during his tenure as Ambassador to the
USSR and while Subject was stationed in Moscow. CHOMON C
At that time was having an affair with a Russian translator/
socretary assigned to him by the Soviets. This person's
husband became knowledgeable of the relationship between
his wife and CHOMON and beat on the door of the Cuban
Embassy one day and proceeded to demand that CHOMON
leave his wife alone. Subsequently a formal protest was
received through Soviet foreign service channels. As a
result of this incident, CHOMON asked Subject to take a 24
walk with him (He didn't trust the Soviets and felt the
Cuben Embassy was banged.) in emer to discuss this
problem and the possible solution for it. Although CHOMON
did not specifically state anything in this vein, Subject
obtained the impression during the last two meetings in
the Argentine Embassy in early 1962 that CHOMON was
anything but happy with his lot under the Castro regims.
Subject feit it would be worthwhile and alleged his willing-
ness to prepare a "recruitment letter" for mailing to
CHOMON in Cuba,

e. Floreal CHOMON Mediavilla was born about 1930
in Camaguey, and, according to latest KUBARK informa-
tion, is presently Charge d' Affaires of the Cuban Legation
in Iraq. Prior to this assignment, CHOMON was First
Secretary with the Cuban Erbassy in Morocco. Subject
described CHOMON as a sensitive, slightly effeminate
Individual who is relatively usinterested in politics. Sub-
ject feels that CHONION obtained the position with the
Cuban foreign service by virtue of the fact that he is Faure
CHOMON's brother. Subject feels that Floreal CHOMON
would also welcome an opportunity to talk with him if the
fact of their meeting could be kept from the Cuban govern-
ment. He speculated that any attempt to gain CHOMON'
cooperation would depend on the position Faure CHOMON
bas assumed toward the Castro regime. Subject feels
that most of Floreal CASTRO's decisions are based on the
attitude and opinion of his older brother Faure. If through
letters from or conversations with his okier brother, Floreal
had obtained the impression that Faure was becoming dis-
satisfied with the Castro regime, he probably likewise
would assume such an attitude and conceivably be receptive.
to a recruitment approach.
7. OPERATIONAL PROPOSALS: We are currently retracing
the individuals listed in the preceeding paragraph. Upon completion of
these traces, it is suggested that a dispatch be prepared to Mexico City
Station outlining all information on Esubio AZCUE including that supplied
by Subject. This dispatch would also outline Headquarters' interest in
perhaps wing Subject in an operational approach to AZCUE. Mexico
City Station would be asked to describe the extent to which they could
support auch an operation through surveillance of AZCUE, locating his
present residence and other information relative to is current activities
and political orientation. (Comment:) We discussed in principle with
the Subject whether or not he would be willing to travel to Mexico City
with a KUBARK case officer for the purpose of such an approach. Sub-
ject tentatively indicated his willingness to cooperate in such a venture
but appeared to have some reservation re the danger that might accrue
him. He pointed out that he has a wife and six children to support and
soon expects to be joined by his father and mother-in-law who are cur-
rently in Miami. We attempted to reassure Subject that very little danger

would be involved since he would be under surveillance by AUBARK
officers at all times and would serve only as a means of effecting the
introduction of KUBARK to AZCUE. Although we cannot be certain,
we feel that i. properly presented Subject would cooperate with KUBARK
in such a venture.
8. The information reflected above and relating to RODRIGUEZ,
BLANCO, Floraal CHOMON, and Faure CHOMON, will be made avail-
abhi to SAS/11 in order to determine whether or not they may be interested
in exploiting these leads. An operation involving the preparation of a
letter by Subject for forwarding to Faure CHOMON would be simple to
prepare but difficult to carry out in that we do not have a current home
address for him. Subject indicated that he believed Faure CHOMON in
1961 lived on First Street, $105, Apt. 7, in Habana. However, we can-
not be sure that this address is current. Subject indicated that perhaps
(inu) San Pedro y Grillo Aving at Anunciacion 10, 6th floor, in Madrid,
as of 1981, is probably the first wife or another relative of Faute CHOMON.
She is allegedly the cukural attache with the Cuban Embassy in Madrid.
Perhaps it would be possible to obtain CHOMON's surrent address
through COS Madrid Conceivably COS Madrid could ask its liaison 15-2.
with the Spanish service to place intercepts on this address and than
obtain Faure CHOMON's current home address in Habana, Assuming
he is corresponding with this individual,

9. MISCELLANEOUS: We were only able to obtain the names
of two individuals from subject who he believed definitely to be G-2
officers. These were the individuals who accompanied Faure CHOMON
when he visited Subject in May of 1961 at the Argentine En.bassy in
Habana. The first of these was Carlos FIGARELLO, aka El Chino,
FIGARELLO was born about 1930 and Subject was able to say little more
about him than this in as much as he spent most of the time during this
meeting talking with Faure CHOMON. OS CHOMON'a second visit to
the Argentine Embassy he was accompanied by (fnu) JIMENEZ, aka
Himenito, also born about 1930 and the son of (inu) Santos JIMENEZ.
JIMENEZ Wes, according to Subject, at one time the director of the
revolutionary newspaper "Combate". Subject was unable to supply
further izformation on this individual.
10. Subject was shown the KUBARK list of Cuban diplomatic
and consular personnel abroad dated April 1963 and was able to identify
a number of Individuals appearing on this list as known to him. These
individuals would be basically Fl leads and Subject indicated be was not

1. Gustavo MEDIAVILLA de la Pena is listed as com-
mercial attache with the Cuban Embassy in Germany.

with the Cuban Embassy in Iraq. Subject believes he war
at one time acquainted with LINARES who was connected
with the Manoio CASTRO group at the University of Habana.
Subject describes LINARES as a slender individual with a
pisasant personality. He is a mulatto.
m. Gustavo ARCOS y Bargnes is listed as Ambassador
to Belgium and Luxembourg and resident in Brussels. Car

described PROENZA as a cold-blooded emotionless woman
who is nicknamed "the mummy".

to the Cuban Embassy in Sweden. Subject knows PULIDO
as being a good friend of Enrique RODRIGUEZ Loeche,
Ambassador to Aiorocco.
q. Armando PEREZ Pinto is listed as commercial
counselor with the Cuban Embassy in the USSR. Subject
believes PEREZ is not of Cuban birth, but from Haiti.
Subject could only say that PEREZ was a nice young man,
born about 1935, who did not give the impression of being
a rabid Communist.
r. Juan JUARBE y Juarbo is listed as the counselor
of the Cuban Delegation to the United Nations. Subject knows
JUARBE and thinks he is Puerto Rican or Venezuelan by
birth rather than a Cuban.
8. Laura MENESES de Albizu Campos: According to
Subject, MENESES is not a Cuban but he is not sure of her
ettonality. Although he met MENESES he is unable to
supply further significant dats.

of the Cuban Delegation to the United Nations. Subject sus-
pects that MEDIAVILLA is a cruals to the CHOMON brothers.
11. Orlando PEREZ was met by Subject during his tour in Moscow,
PEREZ was the Charge d' Affaires at the Cuban Embassy in Moscow.
Subject became slightly acquainted with PEREZ and obtained the impres-
sion that PEREZ is not pro-Castro. He is married to an American

12. We asked Subject whether or not he was acquainted with any
individual belonging to the Cuban military. He could supply no signifi-
cant namer or information in this sphere. He did advise us that a
potential source for this type of information was one Eloy GUTIERREZ
Menoyo. According to Subject, GUTIERREZ was formerly a Cuban
army officer and would have many contacts in this area. As an aside,
Subject stated that GUTIERREZ had supplied weapons to Fidel CASTRO
during the 1958-59 period through an individual who he knew cnly as
(nu) GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ apparently in turn obtained the weapons
from a (fnu) SAGARO who was a resident of Santiago de Cuba. Of even
more interest, Subject stated that GONZALEZ was, during this same
period, in contact with Otto SKORZENY in Madrid and Belgium. Sub-
ject could no longer remember where he had heard this information and
could only add that as he remembered, GONZALEZ had seen SKORZENY.
in Madrid and Brussels, Belgium, during this period. It is felt that this
piece of information may be of more than normal significance in that we
recall having been told several years ago that SKORZENY was of opera-
tional interest to KUBARK. As we remember, SKORZENY was at that
time suspected of or reported to be the key figure in a Communist/KGB.
illegal funding apparatus. We will check with the CI Staff, WE, and EE,
in order to determine whether further information on SKORZENY'S
alleged activities was ever developed.
13. Raul RODRIGUEZ Feo is, according to Subject, a profes-
sional in the Cuban foreign service. Subject does not know for certain
whore RODRIGUEZ is presently stationed but suspects he is in lHabana,
RODRIGUEZ does not appear in the KUBARK list of Cuban diplomats
abroad, RODRIGUEZ is a good friend of Subject and his wife, and Sub- 08
ject's wife has known Mrs. RODRIGUEZ since both were small girls.
RODRIGUEZ was born about 1912 and studied at the University of Habana,
He and Subject attended the same secondary schools in Sagua La Grande,
Cuba. Subject states thai RODRIGUEZ is definitely not a Communist
and probably would cooperate in any anti-Castro activity KUBARK might
aak of him,
14. Carlos LAC was born about 1923 in Cuba and is a Certified
Publie Accountant, subject is good friends with LAO in that both of them
worked together in attempting to overthrow the Batista regime. LAO
refugeed to the United States from Cuba in October 1962 and now lives
in Willerate, Minnesota. Subject volunteered LAQ's name as an Individ-
ual who knows everybody of any significance in Holguin, Cuba, and the
surrounding area.

15. UFGA 7428, 31 January 1963, contains information obtained
by JMWAVE regarding Subject and indicated him to be emotionally un-
stable, eccentric, and generally reputed to be something of a nut. We
are inclined to agree with this information in so far as Subject's eco-
nomical theory is concerned. During his stay of almost one year as
an asylee in the Argentine Embassy in Habana, Subject spent the copious
spare time available to him writing an economic treatise. On our meet-
ing with Subject on May 4th, Subject provided us with a handwritten
short summary of this docament. According to this summary, Subject
has been attempting to correlate economic cycles with peaks of sunspot
activity. He backs up his "economic argument" with reference to the
Old Testament and the Aztec Calendar. If Subject has been expounding
this theory in public we are not surprised that he is considered some-
what of a nut. It should be noted, however, that many otherwise sane
and useful people believe in horoscopes and other similar superstitions.
We do not feel that this quirk in his personality must necessarily be con-
sidered derogatory in terms of his possible operational exploitation by
KUBARK. Although we have spent less than ten hours with Subject, our
impression is that he is a rational individual in terms of his attitude
towards and relationships with other individuals and personalities around
him. As a matter of fact, we obtained the impression that Subject pos-
sesses more than his fair share of what is sometimes termed "common
sense". The handwritten summary of Subject's economic theory as per-
taining to cunspots is appeted to this memorandum as attachment.
