Previous information has indicated that the
captioned anti-Castro organization is planning to carry out
a bombing raid over Cuba from Bimini in the Bahama Islands.
The airplane scheduled to be used in the raid reportedly is
located at the Broward International Airport, Fort Lauderdale,
Florida.
On December 14, 1963, our source in this matter who has
furnished reliable information in the past advised that
William Johnson, a United States citizen, pilot and businessman
who has previously been involved in anti-Castro activities,
received $450 from the treasurer of the captioned organization
for obtaining the airplane to be used in this operation.
On December 16, 1963, our source advised that the
airplane to be used on the bombing raid is an Aero Commander,
number N2624B, which is located at Broward International Airport
and which is the property of Charles Bush who operates an
aviation company at the airport. Bush is scheduled to fly the
airplane from Fort Lauderdale to Bimini. Practice flights were
scheduled to be made on December 16 and 17, 1963, and
consideration was being given to having the airplane fly over
Bimini during the December 17, 1963, flight.
Our source further advised that the captioned
organization intends to utilize two boats in this operation.
A large boat piloted by a Cuban captain will depart from the
Miami, Florida, area without contraband on an ostensible fishing
trip on the evening of the scheduled raid. This boat will
rendezvous at sea with a smaller fast boat carrying the

demolition bombs which will have departed from the Homestead,
Florida, area. The bombs will be loaded on the bigger boat
which will then proceed to the airport at Bimini. Our source
believes that a small farm owned by Laredo Rodriguez, treasurer
of the captioned organization, located in the area of Homestead
Bay Front Park, on or near a canal, will be utilized in the plans
for the departure of the small boat.
According to information obtained by our source, the
bombing expert who will participate in this operation is one
Orlando Ramirez. Available information indicates that this
individual is possibly identical with Daniel Orlando Raminez Denis
who has served as a bombing expert on one or more raids previously
conducted by the captioned organization.
Orlando Bosch Avila, head of the captioned organization,
has indicated he desires that this operation take place during
the current week.
British authorities were advised of the above
Noformation. (U)
