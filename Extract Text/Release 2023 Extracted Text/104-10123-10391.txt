When he retires 31 August 1970, Mr. James W. McCord, Jr., will
have completed 25 years of Government service, 19 years of which were with
the CIA in a variety of assignments covering the investigative, counter-intelli-
gence, overscas security suppert, audio countermeasures and physical security
fields within the Security Career Service.
During his early years of employment when assigned to the San Francisco
Field Office, Office of Security, August 1951 to May 1953, Mr. McCord assisted
in the covert entry and processing through customs of operational personnel
from the Far East areas and performed safehouse duties and related taske
icsigned to ensure the protection and cover of such personnel.
When serving with the Security Research Staff, 1955 to 1962, Mr. McCord
worked in direct support of Agency activities abroad of a specialized nature ex-
ploiting highly sensitive latelligence source material resulting in the reconstruction
of Soviet espionage networks and resolving operational and security leads affecting
both the British and United States Goveruments. The identities, composition and
operations of Soviet intelligence services in Europe prior to 1950 and dating back
into the 1930's, were reconstructed. Between 1955 and 1960, Mr. McCord was
involved in contacting, developing and debriefing these identified and available

former Soviet intelligence personalities. This activity led to close
liaison with British and other Western intelligence representatives
involving numerous trips to Europe. This liaison activity with 24
representatives of the British MI-5) established a direct channel
of communications resulting in a continuous exchange of leads and
a flow of operational data over the years of benefit to the Agency.
During the period of his work with the Security Research
Staff, in which he served as Deputy Chief from May 1957, Mr.
McCord was the Agency's case officer in a number of double agent
cases involving Agency staff employees who had been contacted
and were being developed for recruitment by the Soviet intelligence
service.
:
From 1962 to 1964, Mr. McCord served overseas as Chief 15:20
of the Regional Security Support Staff located at Frankfurt, Germany)
with responsibility for the overall personnel and physical security
and audio countermeasures programs applicable to the Stations and
Bases of the European area. This assignment was followed by
attendance at the Air War College, August 1964 to June 1965.
For the past five years, Mr. McCord has held two vital line
positions with world-wide responsibilities involving the Agency's
audio countermeasures and physical security programs.
As Chief of the Technical Division from 23 July 1965 to
10 October 1968, Mr. McCord supervised a technical operation
with considerable skill. Although not an engineer by training, be
spanned a difficult gap between the administrative and technical
demands of his responsibilities, guiding the development of useful
and esoteric equipment in the counter-audio field to a point where
the Agency became the recognized leader among Government depart-
ments in this area of activity. This leadership is evidenced by the

establishment of an Inter-Agency Technical Training Center under
the Executive Agency of the Technical Division for the Technical
Surveillance Countermeasures Committee of the United States
Intelligence Board. Much of Mr. McCord's ideas, talents, and
imagination went into the creation of this training activity which
commenced operations about the time of his reassignment to the
Physical Security Division.
Mr. McCord participated with two subordinate employees
in the development of x-ray equipment for use by the Technical
Division in detecting and locating hostile audio devices implanted
in office appurtenances and walls of Agency occupied facilities.
The responsibility for ensuring that appropriate protective methods
for the safe use of this equipment was also associated with this
development. The significance of this achievement was recognized
by the Agency when Mr. McCord and his participating colleagues
were awarded Certificates of Merit
in October 1966.
In his current position as Chief, Physical Security Division,
Mr. McCord demonstrated his ability to quickly assimilate the
necessary details of a field in which he had relatively little ex-
perience. He showed initiative in seeking out new ways and means
to harden the security of the Agency's domestic and overseas
facilities by tapping all possible technological resources, both in
and out of Government, to produce for the Agency a posture in the
physical security field which is the equal of, if not superior to, those
of other elements of the United States Government. Illustrative of
this effort is the expansion and Improvement of the Agency's Security
Command Center relating to the protection of Agency assets in time
of demonstrations, riots and civil disturbances.
Throughout his Agency career, Mr. McCord has engaged
his curious and inventive mind to search out even better ways to
solve problems within his area of responsibility. As a result, his
SECRET

Agency career is a record of sustained superior performance of
duty of high value. The value of his exemplary performance over
the years has often been recognized and commended by senior
officials of the Agency. It is on this basis that Mr. McCord is
nominated for the Certificate of Distinction upon the occasion of
his retirement.
