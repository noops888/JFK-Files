1. Reference is made to your report, subject as above, #105-2118, dated
17 February 1961, which reflected that Subject was located at the Alien
Detention Facility, McAllen, Texas.
2. Recently, CIA advised this Headquarters that, according to an official
Portuguese services Subject had contacted one Lindsey Ling, aka: Ling
Lind Sey, DPOB: 12 March 1919, in Chekiang, China, in late August 1960
in Santa Maria, the Azores. Ling currently resides in Madrid where he
manages a restaurant allegedly owned by another unidentified Chinese who
reportedly has supplied clothing to US personnel at Lajes Base in the
Azores. Ling is one of several Chinese subjects who are suspected of
using their business ventures as a cover for espionage or other illegal
activities. The CIA report also reflects that one Theodor Heinz Wiener,
who had represented the clothing firm in the Azores, was reportedly
arrested there in December 1958 on suspicion of espionage, and was, as
of September 1960, reportedly in Bermuda, where Ling was planning to go
to determine the feasibility of establishing another restaurant.
3. It is requested that Subject be questioned concerning the nature and
extent of his association with Ling and other Chinese, and that this
office be advised of any information which may reflect espionage or
other illegal activities affecting USAF interests. His possible associ-
ation with Wiener also should be explored.
