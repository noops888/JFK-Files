SE/OP/S (carol karpoff
SUBJECT : Sergey Aleksandrovich UZLOV (201-948382)
1. Returning your 201 herewith. As you will recall I borrowed 201 since UZLOV
had reported on an acquaintance who reportedly knew OSWALD. This information
and Source's identity was passed to CI/Staff to be given to HSCA in view of the
latter's interest in OSWALD et al.
2. Thanks again to you and Victor who phoned UZLOV to alert him to potential
query from HSCA. To date, I personally have no details as to whether HSCA
pursued lead!
