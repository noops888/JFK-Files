SUBJECT: Fund Memorandum o. 62 of Docember 21, 1951 a taching copies of
document. rerarding the activities of the Central and Testern
Europea. Conference (Slavik-lajor Group)
Your attention is invited to subject memorsair which mates a
speech by Jerzy Lerski, Vice Chairman of the Polisa Fo'itical Council's
Working Committee in the United States, promosing the formation of a
domestic political pressure group of American resiuents of Bas ern
Curopea stock. In the course of his speech, l. Lerski repeats erd
endorses the official statement of Aims ad Principles of sieration
of Americans of Central and Cast European Descent. This statement,
particularly in its paragrapi. o. 3, proposes that their objectives
should be obtained through "unified political action."
The Department is obviously in complete support of their basic
objective, namely, the overthrow of Communism. coverer, we do perceive
real harm in the utilization of Ce funds to prozote domestic political
pressure groups; especially, when such crows will self-avom etge in
political and election contests in the United States in order to further
their objectives abroad.
Accordingly, we would surest that stens be taken to enstret.t
groups which are sponsored b or supported throth affiliation with
Co be restrained from participating in or assisting such uczestic
political pressure groups as is provosed in subject Sunder
..uc.. groups shoud be cautioned, in any event, to avoid any public
declarations of intent to intervene in dorestic berican politics.

authentic information on Soviet Russien tyranny and atrocity behind
the iron curtains of Central surope and Asia, in the promulation of
necessary stops aimed at the formation of a global netwerk of antt-
Communist alliances, notably within the Soviet spire, in the formu

in the persistent counteraction of binister Communist and other anti-

rights and self-government to the nations which have been forcibly
deprived of them and to secure the exercise of the fundamental right

accorded this right, particularly in the countries of Central and

7. Recognising the twofeld naud, vise ridding all countries

Pureau (see Attaciunent 3) and he
