with the purpose of coordinating, administering, and execu-
ting all maritime activity: At that time, it was announced
that the offices within the Ministry of Transportation having
to do with maritime activities would be transferred to the
Ministry of Merchant Marine and Ports.)
2. As of March 1971, the Ministry of Transportation

offices to the new Ministry of Merchant Marine and Ports,
which had not yet been completely organized. Attached as

Following is a description of the MITRANS organization:

portation was Faure Chomon, although the latter had
been replaced in December 1970 by Major Enrique Lusson
Batlle.)
B. Office of the Minister. Piro Barerro
was in charge of this office and the chief Secretary was
Barreto (fnu). Both were with Faure Chomon,
Minister of Transportation, in the Directorate during
the Cuban Revolution.

which was led by Chomon and was active during the Cuban
Revolution.) Within MITRANS, Barerro and Barreto were
Chomon's principal assistants. One Soviet advisor, an
economist, also worked in this office. Both Barerro and
Barreto were expecting to be transferred to the Ministry
of Merchant Marine and Ports.
c. First Vice-Minister. The First Vice-Minister
was G.Gonzalez, who is also a former member of the
DR. Gonzalez has general administrative responsibilities
Within MITRANS. (Headquarters Comment: Gumersindo
Gonzalez is the First Vice-Minister and Vice-Minister
of Economy in MITRANS according to the Directory of Cuban
Personalities.)
D. Second Vice-Minister. The Second Vice-Minister,
Alepuz (fnu)is also a former member of the DR. He had
responsibility over the Departments of Laws and Regulations.
One Soviet advisor worked in the office; he was Gorny
(fnu), a naval architect from a Leningrad ship construction
institute. (Headquarters Comment: According to the Directory
of Cuban Personalities, Manuel Alepuz Llansana is
the MITRANS Vice-Minister for Regulations and Technical
Standards.)
(1)Laws: The Director of this department
was Joaquin de la Cruz, a former member of the DR.
All of this department pertaining to shipping and port laws was
to be transferred to the Ministry of Merchant Marine and
Ports. Within the Department of Laws, were two sections:
a commission which investigated accidents, and a legal
section which wrote the rules and regulations governing
ship, rail, bus, and truck transportation. It also operated
a driving school and issued drivers' licenses.
(2) Regulations; This department consisted
of naval construction and inspection sections and was
headed by Captain Silvio (fnu), a former member of the
DR. All of the Regulations Department was to be transferred
to the Ministry of Merchant Marine and Ports.
(a) Naval Construction Section: This
section, within the Regulations Department, was headed by
Eduardo Tapanes, a Soviet-trained engineer. The
section contained two offices: the dry docks office in which
five Soviet engineers worked, and the shipyards section
where two Soviet ship repair engineers worked. Since the
beginning of 1969, Tapanes had spent the major part of his
time as the MITRANS representative working in the Cuban
Commercial Office in London, England. In 1968, he had an
office at a shipyard on Havana Bay (AMS Series E 9210,
Havana Sheet 2 UTM Grid 630697 to 635597). During this
time he often visited the Soviet Naval Association for
assistance. This association, composed of Soviet naval
officers, had offices in a building on the block bounded
by Mercaderes, O'Reilly, Obispo and Tacon Streets in Havana.
In late 1970, Tapanes, civilian, was given the naval rank of
Captain. (Canadian Service Comment: Source said that many civilian employees of
MITRANS were being given military ranks when they transferred
to the Ministry of Merchant Marine and Ports.)
(b) Inspection Section: This section,
headed by Captain Silvio, was responsible for inspecting
all non-military ships entering Cuban ports. All employees
of this section were on detached duty from the Mambisas
Shipping Line.
