CHLET/Operational - Trace Reply - Nikola SIC (201-277478)
REF: IMMA 22150
1. Following on Nikola SIC, born 8 August 1921 at Senaj
Rijeka, Yugoslavia and currently assigned as Counselor, Yugoslav
Embassy, Mexico City.
1. "According to a fairly reliable detector source, Nikola
ZIC was a UB (Uprava drzavne bezbednosti - Administration of
State Security) official in Rijeka in 1945-46, assigned to the
City UDB. In 1946 a scandal broke out at the City UDB in Rijeka,
involving corruption, stealing of official funds or similar matters,
and the head of the city UDB (name unknown) was imprisoned in this
connection. At that time ZIC was transferred to the UDB in Zagreb,
but Source does not know whether ZIC himself was involved in this
affair. Later on ZIC was transferred to Belgrade, but Source does
not know whether to UDB or directly to the State Secretariat for
Foreign Affairs (SIPA). In the mid - '50's ZIC was employed in
SPA, his office was downstairs, i.e., not in the Coordination
Department (the Yugoslav foreign intelligence service). However,
he worked with Kosilo SIBINOVIC (201-64553), an identified Co-
ordination officer, and therefore Source assumes that ZIC was
really a Coordination man. Source first met ZIC in Rijeka either
in 1945 or 1946. Since then he has seen him a few times; he last
talked to him in Belgrade in 1949 or 1950. (The source of the
foregoing information defected from a commercial representation
position in Spain in July 1962.)
2. According to an Italian liaison report, DEMIJOHN names one
Nikola ZIC as first assistant to the UDB Chief at Fiume and Basak,
Yugoslavia in June 1948.

3. A Yugoslav refugee interviewed by ODOPAL in January 1955
named Nikola ZIC, Major, born circa 1919, residing in Sesak, a
second in command of the civilian UDB in Rijeka, Yugoslavia. He
was then alleged to be having an affair with Marija BULJ, who
escaped to Austria during the summer of 1954 as an KGB agent.
4. According to a well-placed and reliable source, Nikola
ZIC served in London from 1959-1962 as one of the assistants of
the London Resident, under cover as Chief of the Consular Section
of the Yugoslav Embassy in London. The source added that ZIC
"had been assigned a difficult task by the Coordination Department."
Source could not find out what it was, but learned that ZIC was
preoccupied about it and feared that he would not be able to carry
it out. Source described ZIC as "a bad and dangerous man."
5. A British liaison report states that Nikola ZIC came to
London in February 1959 and replaced Jozidar GORJAR as head of
the Yugoslav Consular Section. He was born on 31 August 1921. As
according to the British, there was no reason to doubt that his
replacement was not also an intelligence officer.
6. Prior to his assignment to Mexico, ZIC served at SIPA
Headquarters in Belgrade for one year. Enroute to Mexico, he
stopped over in the United States and conferred for five hours with
an identified Coordination officer.
7. In first listed on the Diario Oficial as of 1 August
1963, as Counselor of the Yugoslav Embassy, with residence at Prado
Sur 225 (Losas), and telephone number 20-68-33. He bears Passport
No. D-011388. On 23 August 1963 he entered Costa Rica by air from
Mexico and departed for Panama on 16 August by air. He departed
Panama for Caracas, Venezuela, on 29 August and returned via
Panama to Mexico on 31 August 1963.
8. Information copies of this trace are being sent to
Costa Rica, Panama and Venezuela, on the probability that subject
will travel in those areas again during his tour in Mexico City,
and the respective Stations may wish to keep an eye on his activities.
