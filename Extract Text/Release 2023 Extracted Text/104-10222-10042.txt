MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, GS-13 Evaluation Board
SUBJECT
: Recommendation for Promotion to GS-14
Charlotte Bustos-Videla
1. It is recommended that Charlotte Bustos-Videla be promoted
from GS-13 to GS-14,
2. The performance of this officer has been characterized for
many years by all of her supervisors as consistently strong to out-
standing. She has been able to establish herself as indispensable in-
each Headquarters Branch or Field Station assignment, usually
functioning as the backbone of the unit to which assigned. Since return
to Headquarters in September 1972 from her field assignment in Mexico,
her performance has been entirely congruent with the thrust of the
Field Station's enthusiasm over her ability, performance, attitude and
growth potential. She is currently chief of the Cuban and CA Section
of her branch, and has established once again her mastery over her
assigned duties. She is the kind of sound, dependable, yet
imaginative officer greatly appreciated by her supervisors. In
short, she is a true professional who performs beyond her grade level.
3. In regard to her potential, she has served in the Agency
since 1951, starting as a secretary/stenographer, and advancing
brilliantly with each new challenge offered. She achieved professional
status in 1953 and has spent the bulk of her time since then specializing
in Latin American affairs, demonstrating total flexibility in assignments,
a voracious appetite for work and a penchant for exceptionally precise
and thorough production. A review of her career to date can lead to the
conclusion that she has always risen successfully to each new
professional challenge, and is still far from reaching her maximum
capacities, While she has had little supervisory experience in the
field, her supervisor was of the option that she is a "natural leader".
This has been borne out in her performance in her current capacity
as a Branch Section Chief, in which she has demonstrated exemplary
supervisory ability. Notwithstanding her drive, aggressiveness and
professional aplomb, she is a popular co-worker, is receptive to guidance
and sensitive and responsive to the needs of her subordinates.

4. This employee has utilized her fluency in the Spanish language
to maximum advantage in her work. Formal testing recently confirmed
her high proficiency in that language. Coupled with a comprehensive
training record and her invaluable experiences over a twenty year
period, she has become particularly effective in Latin American
operations and operational support, demonstrating excellence in each
of several recognized specializations, including CI operations,
functional support, reports and requirements, area support and varied
covert action activities,
5. The officer's adaptability, high intelligence and mastery over
her trade was of inestimable value to Mexico City Station, and over a
five year period from 1967 to 1972, she functioned as the Station's
internal troubleshooter. Her duties included the maintenance of
watchlists, screening of travel documents, processing of raw
technical take, target analysis, reperts writing, operational support,
handling of outside contract agents, and special assignments as the
Chief of Station's Executive Assistant,
6. The employee is occasionally called upon by the Office of
Training to administer specialized training, and she was chosen
recently to attend the Mid-Career Course ending in December 1972.
Meanwhile, her absence from her new job is felt sorely by the
Branch, L is expected that her current assignment will last about
two years,
7. In summary, we have here an exceptional officer who has
been performing at the level of a GS-14 for some years; it is now
time to promote her to that grade commensurate with her performance
and which she so justly deserves.

functional support, reports and requirements, area support and varied
covert action activities,
5. The officer's adaptability, high intelligence and mastery over
her trade was of inestimable value to Mexico City Station, and over a
five year period from 1967 to 1972, she functioned as the Station's
internal troubleshooter. Her duties included the maintenance of
watchlists, screening of travel documents, processing of raw
technical take, target analysis, reperts writing, operational support,
handling of outside contract agents, and special assignments as the
Chief of Station's Executive Assistant,
6. The employee is occasionally called upon by the Office of
Training to administer specialized training, and she was chosen
recently to attend the Mid-Career Course ending in December 1972.
Meanwhile, her absence from her new job is felt sorely by the
Branch, L is expected that her current assignment will last about
two years,
7. In summary, we have here an exceptional officer who has
been performing at the level of a GS-14 for some years; it is now
time to promote her to that grade commensurate with her performance
and which she so justly deserves.
