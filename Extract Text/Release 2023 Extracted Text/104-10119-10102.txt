2023 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
7 November 1962
MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, EAB/PSD/OS
ATTENTION : Mr. Harry Dugan
SUBJECT : Employment of Spouse - Mrs. Dorothy L. Hunt
1. For the past seven months my wife has been employed locally
by Communications Consultants International (CCI), a public relations
subsidiary of McCann-Erickson, the New York advertising firm.
2. McCann-Erickson, through CCI, has held the (Spanish Embassy)
public relations account for the past year, but the (Spanish Government)
is about to cancel the account and do the work itself. Acquaintances
at the (Spanish Embassy) have suggested that my wife help them on a part-
time basis by doing translations, statistical research and occasional
letters for the (Spanish Ambassador). Most of the work could be accomplished
at home and at my wife's convenience, making the employment desirable and
almost unique as jobs for women go.
3. With Agency concurrence, my wife worked for the (Argentine
Ambassador in Tokyo) 1955-56, and though her currently-projected employ-
ment would not hold the intelligence implications of her (Argentine Embassy)
employment, I am assuming that there would be no objection to her perform-
ing the part-time work described.
4. The concurrence of your office is requested.
