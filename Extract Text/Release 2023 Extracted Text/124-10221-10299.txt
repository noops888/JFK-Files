DE ARMAS departed Utica, New York, in March,
1975 for the purpose of obtaining employment in the Miami, Florida
area. He subsequently gained employment as an investigator with
a firm named Preventive Security Service. DE ARMAS explained that
his grandmother presently resides in Caracas, Venezuela and that
he left the United States for Caracas on October 2, 1975 to visit
her. At that time he met MARIA ANTΘΙΝΕΤΤΑ BETANCOURT
the 26 year old daughter of INGA GEELAND, a Norwegian National
currently residing in Cuba and employed as a director of Cuban
Motion Pictures, and the ex-wife of RAUL BETANCOURT of Venezuela.
D'ARMAS stated that MARIA has been involved in the Leftist Movement
in Venezuela along with 4 brothers whose last names are GARCIA-PONCE
who are considered the Leftist elite of that country. DE ARMAS
pointed out that his primary reason for traveling to Caracas was
to place himself in a position where he could be of assistance to
the United States Government. He stated that in conversations with
MARIA and the GARCIA-PONCE Brothers, they discussed numerous
illegal activities including the possibility of drug traffic from
Columbia.M
DE ARMAS returned to Miami on October 4, 1975 and discussed
the overall possibility of establishing contact with the Cuban
Government with the FBI, but in view of the vagueness of his
statements, there was little response from that agency He then

RE: MANUEL LEONARDO DE ARMAS
ERASTOSAFERNANDEZ, 12, whom he described as an Assistant
to the President of Venezuela and a CIA Source: This information (U)
came to his attention from a MINOLO FERNANDEZ whom DE ARMAS
described as a functionary of the Venezuelan General Counsel
in Miami, and also from one RICARDO MORALESINAVARETTE who NEZUELE
functioned out of Caracas. However, DE ARMAS claimed that
the information concerning this individual is common
in certain circles.
common knowledge CUBA
A second individual, ORLANDO GARCIA VASQUEZ
source (U)
was described as a Cuban National in charge of the personal
security of the President of Venezuela and also a CIA source
and apparently in charge of security for high levels of
Venezuelan Government in general. VASQUEZ, according to
DE ARMAS, established a cover for NAVARETTE in Venezuela
who is also working for the CIA, as well as the FBI When (U)
asked how he knew this, DE ARMAS claimed that information
is well known in Miami amoung Cuban emigre groups as well as
in Cuba itself. He claimed that VASQUEZ has been a target of the
Cuban Government for the last fifteen years.
The tape was completed to the satisfaction of his Cuban
Intelligence corroboraters and he described the finished product
as a "bombshell". The tape was then submitted to FIDEL CASTRO
for review and approval. CASTRO reviewed the film prior to its
submission to the Political Bureau and after CASTRO's review it
was sent back to their group for revision. A number of cuts
were made in the video tape which is apparent when viewed in
that the tape in part lacks continuity.
(M)
Reference to ERASTOS FERNANDEZ and ORLAND GARCIA
VASQUEZ was deleted from the video tape." The purpose of these
cuts was to avoid any stress in Venezuelan-Cuban relations.
PASCUAL wad appears to have been the case officer handling
DE ARMAS, told DE ARMAS that CASTRO desired to speak to him
after reviewing the tape. DE ARMAS was placed on standby to
await a summons from CASTRO for interview. About 2 o'clock
a.m. the following morning DE ARMAS received a telephone call
from PASCUAL Informing him that he would be right over to
his hotel room and that CASTRO was ready for his interview.
At about 2:30 a.m. PASCUAL picked him up and drove him to the
Plaza of the Revolution. They entered the building directly
behind the statute of JOSE MARTIN and proceeded to a fifth
floor office occupied by CASTRO.
(M)
DE ARMAS' interview with CASTRO was brief and to
the point. CASTRO was sympathic towards DE ARMAS' position
but spoke as if the impetus for the press conference came from

RE: MANUEL LEONARDO DE ARMAS
DE ARMAS and that for his own reasons CASTRO wanted a number
of revisions made in the tape. CASTRO's attitude implied that he
was permitting the DE ARMAS news release and pointed out that
that release was purely voluntary on DE ARMAS' part.
(AL)
DE ARMAS recalled, that again on his own, he made a
statement at the beginning of the press conference in which he
remarked that the statements he was making were voluntary. His
interview with CASTRO lasted for approximately twenty minutes and
he expressed a completely willing and positive attitude to CASTRO
in the release of the press conference. He did not object in any
way to the revisions which CASTRO had found necessary. DE ARMAS'
impression from his interview with CASTRO was that CASTRO attempted
to convey the impression to him that he or the Cuban Government were
doing DE ARMAS a favor in permitting him to make the press release.
(hi)
At this point in the interview, DE ARMAS explained
that he did not feel that the information that he furnished in
the press release was of any great damage to the United States
Government in that it contained many obvious untruths and
misinformation. As an example, he purposely identified Mr.
FRED DUNCAN as an employee of the CIA when he is actually
an employee of DEA He He reiterated that his motivation throughout tw

Government in order to place himself in a position whereby

accepted full responsibility for all of his actions as
noted throughout this entire affair.
DE ARMAS noted that he had made some comments concerning
one FELIX MARTINEZ whom he identified as a Cuban exile who left
Cuba sometime during the revolution and is connected with the
Anti-CASTRO news media. DE ARMAS did not know MARTINEZ 'and
was simply briefed on his activities by Cuban Intelligence, which
information was reflected in his news release. He also referred to
a POLIEO (phonetic) in the same context. He recalls having
identified MARTINEZ and POLIEO as CIA contract agents Her Preferred
to RICARDO NAVARETTE, mentioned above, also as a CIA contract agent
in Venezuela, which information was not deleted from the press
release. NAVARETTE, according to DE ARMAS, was a State witness in
the case of DR. ORLANDO BOSCH

planting C-4 plastic explosive in his automobile was explored.
After a number of discussions, of which DE ARMAS was privy,
someone in Abdala made the statement to forget about the
plans to kill MASFERRER. DE ARMAS stated that shortly thereafter
MASFERRER was killed when his automobile was bombed. After the
bombing, Mr. ROBERT MILLS of the FBI Miami, approached DE ARMAS and
inquired as to any information he may have as to the bombing and whether
he was personally involved in it. DE ARMAS advised MILLS of the discussions
within ABDALA concerning the possible assassination of MASFERRER but
denied any direct knowledge of MASFERRER's murder.
(3)M)
Cuban Intelligence were aware that DE ARMAS was affiliated
with Abdala and they also believed that he had direct knowledge of
the MASFERRER killing. As a result, during his debriefings, DE ARMAS
whom
attributed the receipt of plastic explosive C-4 from BOB MILLS (Wh
he purposely identified as a CIA Officer.) Then Then he claimed that he gave
the explosives to Abdala with the implication that Abdala was
responsible for MASFERRER's murder. (

The bombing of WOBA Broadcaster EMILIO MOULION was
also discussed with DE ARMAS. DE ARMAS claimed that shortly after
furnishing his press release he was naturally branded as a traitor
by the Cuban Community in Miami. MOULION took the position
publicly that the full story concerning DE ARMAS had not come to
light and thereafter statements concerning his treason were unfounded
at the time. About 3 days after his defense of DE ARMAS,
his automobile was bombed with the result that MOULION
