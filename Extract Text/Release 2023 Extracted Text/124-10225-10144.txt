reliable, in private conversation with a Cuban exile who is
independent of any Cuban exile organization.
The general opinion among Cuban exiles is that the United States
will not encourage exile groups to mount a major assault on Cuba
until after the United States elections.
The United States, the exiles say, is providing a steady flow of
aid to the Movimiento de Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MRR, Move
ment for Revolutionary Recovery), which is led by Manuel Artime
Buesa.
Some exiles claim that the attack by the MRR on Puerto
The
Pilon in May 1964 was launched from the Dominican Republic.
is no evidence that Artime is receiving support from the Venezu
Government. His failure to establish personal contact with the
Administration (Venezuelan) during his visit to Caracas between
22-27 May 1964 has provoked criticism in government circles.
disillusionment with the MRR is said to be caused by Artime's
failure to establish himself as the undisputed leader of the
militant exile forces.
Soms
Former Cuban President Carlos Prio Socarras is said to be giving
financial support to Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, paramilitary leader of
the Alliance of the Segundo Frente Nacional del Escambray (SFNE,
Second National Front of the Escambray), the Movimiento Revolu-
cionario del Pueblo (MRP, Revolutionary Movement of the People),
and Alpha-66. The purpose of the subsidy is to prevent the
Alliance from forming close political or operational ties with
JURE. According to Cuban exiles in Miami, JURE is politically to
the left of all other Cuban exile parties. Some exiles claim
that several Communists, acting as agents for the Castro régime,
have succeeded in infiltrating JURE.
