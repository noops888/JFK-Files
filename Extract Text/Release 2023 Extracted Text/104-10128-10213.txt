1. NEW YORK TIMES OF 1 MARCH CARRIES ARTICLE ON PAGE 8 ENTITLED
"CIA MONEY FLOWED, BUT U.S. AIDES INSIST IT WAS FOR INTELLIGENCE."
ARTICLE STATES IT IS NOW CLEAR THAT CIA FUNNELED LARGE SUMS OF MONEY
TO FOREIGN LEADERS, BUT OFFICIALS INSIST THAT PAYMENTS WERE INTENDED
NOT AS BRIBERY BUT FOR INTELLIGENCE SERVICES. DAVID PHILLIPS WHO IS
DESCRIBED AS A FORMER CIA OFFICIAL WHO SERVED BOTH IN MEXICO AND
VENEZUELA, AND WHO LATER WAS CHIEF OF THE AGENCY'S LATIN AMERICAN
OPERATIONS, IS QUOTED AS SAYING: "IF I WERE CALLED TO TESTIFY UNDER
OATH THAT PEREZ OR ECHEVERRIA WERE ON A CIA PAYROLL OR RECEIVED MONEY
FOR THEIR PERSONAL USE, I WOULD TESTIFY THAT THEY DID NOT. I WAS IN
BOTH COUNTRIES, AND I WAS THE BOSS."
