1.. According to SGAA-33428 (29 Λυκ. 58) no one In
Kathimerini had ever heard of DIMITRAKOPOULOS before 1943.
He reportedly was introduced to Kostas ZAFEIROPOULOS (of
Eathimerini) by Leon MAKKAS. According to EKAW-7039
(13 Dec 1966), TIMEFIFO16/20 slated that dating way back
to the 1950's DINITRAROPOULOS was considered an American
agent and that he had good access to Greek military infor-
mation via Leon HAKKAS who at that time was "Chief of Staff
of the Greek Navy" and through whose offices he had managed
to get good access to the Greek Pentagon. The following
are pertinent licadquarters traces on MAKKAS and ZAFEIROPOULOS:
A. MAKKAS, Leon (201-232863)
Dorn 1892, in Athens, Greece, the son of Dimitrios;
studied law at the Universities of Athens and Paris;
1914-22-journalist in Paris; 1922-28 - Director of
tho Press Bureau of the Grcok Embassy in Paris; entered
politics in the August 1928 elections under the Liberal
Party banner and elected Deputy for Athens; Under-
Secretary of the Navy (Plastiras cabinet) 15 Apr11-18 Aug 1950,
and in 1952 a member of the Greek delegation to the UN
General Assembly, fifth session, New York. He remained
In Greek politics upuuntil at least 1965.
A report from the 8th Service Command, ASF, Dallas,
Texas, dated 17 Apr 45, contained the information that
when the Germans left Cophalonia, the ELAS forces took
over police, customs, and all administrative duties of
the Island. The Greek Government of Athens sent a
commission headed by fou MAKAS to Cephalonia and Corfu
to set up an administration, which he did but "did not
seen to interfere or have any difficulty with the ELAS
forces." The MAKAS mentioned may or may not be identical
with Leon MAKKAS.
MAKKAS throughout his career has espoused the idea
of improving Greek-Sov reek-Soviet and Greek-Bloc (particularly
Eulgarian and Yugoslav) relations. Eleftheria carried
an arttele on 22 June 1956, in which MAKKAS strongly
urged, among other things, the betterment of relations
with the Soviet Union and referred ironically to the
Government's "servile attitude" towards the western
allies in this connection.
In mid-May 1957 (SGA-5371, 28 May 57), a Provisional
Committee Against Thermo-nuclear Tests and Atomic Warfare
was formed in Athens under Leon MAKKAS as president. Two
former EDA officials, Iraklis PAPACHRISTOU and his wife
Eurydie SPYROMILIOU (the latter with a record of pro-
Communist activities up to the end of 1955), played pro-
minent roles in this organization; at least five of the
sixty personalities who signed the initial appeal of the
WAKKAS organization were Communists or pro-Communists;
at least 15 other persons who signed the appeal had a
record of activity in one or more of the Greek Communist
front organizations. MAKKAS has been a member of numerous
organizations such as the WPC Congress, Stockhola,
16-23 July 1958; the Sponsoring Committee, Congress for
Disarmament and International Cooperation, Stockholm,
July 1958 (in which organization he was closely asso-
ciated with Stamatios VERKOURIS); the Governing Council
of the Greek Peace Committee, January 1959, and others.
MARKAS went to Bucharent in September 1959 at the
invitation of "RPR National Committee for the Defouse of

the Poors" He attended the third East-Best Round Table
Conference at London in February 1960, which was left-
wing and Communist In tone.
In January 1958, MAKKAS proposed : Rumanian
Ambassador Fon DRINCEANU that a Balkan conference of
personalities representing organizations along Afro-
Asian Conference prototype de forted. ARRAS suggested
Belgrade as a conference site but DRINGENU disagreed
on the site location and suggested Bucharest. MARKAS
visited Belgrade to discuss the above situation with
Micha PAVITCUEVITCH.
:
ΕΑΤΠΕ 0469, 21 Jan 58, reported that a usually
reliable source close to GOG eireles stated that "it
wus evident that Leon MAKKAS had gone completely over
to the Commie side and was now participating in the
publication of the Commie front magazine Public Opinion"
and that Theodore VOKAS, the former director, was a
long-time Communist. Public Opinion had run a poll on
the wisuile site question, "coming up with the absurd
conclusion that 70 per cent of the Greeks were opposed
to the missiles."
CS 3/344,265, 14 Feb 58, Subject, "Leftist Pla០១
for Future Action in Greece," reported that EDA Deputy
Ilias ILIOU met with former Minister of Commerce Leon
MAKKAS on 30 December (1957) and discussed the leftist
plans for future action in Greece; HAKKAS agreed fully
that EDA should follow in the future a policy of co-
exfotence with other parties; independence in foreign
policy; resistance to NATO atomic and missile bases for
Grecce; democratic and social justice, etc. MAKKAS
also promised full cooperation in any nes popular front.
In December 1963, HAKKAS reportedly was appointed
Greek Ambassador to Belgrade. After his appointment was
mentioned in the press, THODIUM reported that MARKAS
had called the Soviets about his appointment. THPLANK
told Chief of Station, Athens (CUSICK) that he thought
the calls were very suspicious and had asked Minister
of Foreign Affairs Sofoklis VENIZELOS not to appoint
MAKKAS to Belgrade. VENIZELOS reportedly told TIPLANK
that although "MAKKAS was a stupid and ridiculous man,
he was hardly a Soviet spy." VENIZELOS reportedly
wished to improve rolations between Greece and Yugoslavia
with the appointment of MAKKAS. (Headquarters files do
not reflect that MAKKAS! appointment ever became effective.)
1
In June 1965, it was reported (PARI 8814, 25 June, 65)
that "left leaning" MAKKAS had replaced Spiro PECCASCOSHETATOS
(Counselor of the Greek Embassy, Faris, for Press Affairs
for more than twenty years). MAKKAS reportedly protested
his predecessor's failure to establish contact with the
Communist paper L'Humanite.
Iu March 1965, it was reported that KAKKAS, Greek
Permanent Representative to the Council of Europe, had
been sent ou a mission in Paris according to George
PAPANDREOU's instructions ostensibly to represent Greeco
in the Council of Europe but to actually obtain informa-
tion regarding KARANANLIS' covements, plans, views, otc.
These reporto reportedly had been received regularly by
PAPANDREOU through secret and non-diplomatic channels

The Congressional Record, dated 22 March 1968, contains
two itens concerning interviews by DIMITRAKOPOULOS with HARTKE

JANEWAY, Ellot (201-833459)
The following background summary, dated August 1952,

JANEMAY married Carol RINDSFOOS, an American citizen.
After graduating from Cornell in 1932, JANEWAY and his
wife traveled to England for the purpose of pursuing
their studies at the London School of Economics.
According to a reliable foreign source, JANEWAY
and his wife left the United Kingdom on August 30, 1933,
and traveled to the Soviet Union. This trip was reportedly
influenced by Serged DINAKOV of the Russian Union of
Revolutionary Friters. Prior to making this trip,

In another LNERGO report (dated 24 Nov 54) conceroing
LOUIS FISCHER, aka FISBLR (201-3286), who, according to
LINERGO, has been considered by rany to have been a Coviet
agent for many years, Carot JANEWAY's name appears in a
section cutitied "Activities and Associates (of YISCHER)
after the German-Sovict, Pact, August 1939," as follows:
An LNERGO source of unknown reliability furnished
information in 1942 which indicated that FISCHER was in
contact with Carol JANEWAY, 124 East 19th Street, New
York City, 10 December 1941.
Another LNERGO source of Loknown reliability ad-
vised on 7 October 1952 that Carol JANEWAY hold member-
chip in the Communist Political Association in 1954,
and was a member of the Sacco-Venzetti Club.
The above informant stated that Carol JANEWAY
attended schools in Soviet Russia during the 1930's
when the sisited that country (although sourco did not
believe the schools were directly connected with the
Communist Party), and that she had Communist literature..
in her apartment.
According to the above LNERGO report, FISCHER re-
called having met Carol JANEWAY and her mother in Russia
during the 1930's. He said she was an amateur painter
or artist.

LNERGO reports describe WASSERMAN as a controversial type,
known as a successful, cappole sttorney, who has been legal
counsel for many I&NS cases and Internal security cases (which
portain mainly to persons connected with bubversive groups,
Soviet cover organizations and persons with Soviet affiliations.)
An LNERGO report dated 20 August 1954, indicates that
WASSERIAN had made out a check in the amount of $125.00 το
one Svetovar MANDUKIC (201-3000). MANDUKIC, of Yugoslav
extraction, was negotiating with the Yugoslav Government re-
garding the construction of a rayon mill in Yugoslavia, and
