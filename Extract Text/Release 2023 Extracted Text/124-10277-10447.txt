RECUPERACION REVOLUCIONARIA (MIRR)
Reference is made to previous information furnished
you concerning captioned anti-Castro organization.
Recently, a source who has furnished insufficient
information to evaluate his reliability advised that
Orlando Bosch Avila, head of MIRR, is making plans to use
an airstrip, not yet selected, in the Bahamas for the purpose
of carrying out raids against Cuba. Two of Bosch's men,
Jesus Sanchez Martinez and (first name unknown) Gonzalez,
will be transported by a fast speedboat to this airstrip
along with about one dozen homemade impact bombs constructed
by Sanchez. An airplane which will be piloted by an unidentified
American reportedly is scheduled to rendezvous on the Bahama
island with Sanchez and Gonzalez, both of whom will accompany
the American pilot on two consecutive bombing raids, spaced
one or two days apart, for the purpose of dropping bombs on
sugar centrals in the Oriente Province of Cuba.
The source stated that the date of the raid has
not yet been set. The speedboat will be brought from Miami,
Florida, to some location north of Miami and then will depart
under cover of darkness for the Bahamas. The plane is scheduled
to depart from its Bahamian airstrip at about 3 a.m. for Cuba
so that the attack can be made during the early hours of dawn.
The same source further advised that Bosch has
also entered into a secret pact with Alpha 66, an anti-Castro
organization headquartered in Miami, to attack a British freighter
carrying equipment to Cuba. This attack reportedly will be

NOTE FOR SAC, MIAMI:
GEOT Reurairtel 6/9/64 with enclosures. DEFurnish the pertinent
information transmitted in your 6/9/64 airtel to the appropriate
Bahamian authorities. Keep Bureau, interested agencies and
Bahamian authorities currently advised of all pertinent developments u
NOTE:
MIRR, anti-Castro organization, has been involved in
#carrying out raids against Cuba, some of which have been twarted
by U. S. authorities. On three previous occasions, planes, boats,
equipment, bombs and personnel have been seized by Customs authori-
ties. In connection with a previous plan to attack Cuba, Department,
in April, 1964, specifically advised it was requesting Customs,
Federal Aviation Agency and Coast Guard to take all possible
measures to prevent the attack. As recently as May 12, 1964,
Customs seized a homemade torpedo which was scheduled to be used
in a MIRR attack against a Cuban vessel. This attack failed to
materialize.
Information has now been received indicating that MIRR
is planning new attack against Cuba. This attack reportedly entails
use of airstrip in the Bahamas from which two consecutive bombing
raids will be launched directed against Cuban sugar installations.
Plans are being made in U. S. and material to be utilized in raid
will be transported from U. S. to the Bahamas. (MIRR has previously
used islands in the Bahamas as base from which to launch such
attacks and we have previously advised Bahamian authorities of these
activities.u
MIRR leader reportedly has also entered into secret pact
with Alpha 66, Miami anti-Castro organization, to attack British
freighter carrying equipment to Cuba. Reportedly, this attack
will also be made from Bahamas at some future time following
completion of current plans of MIRR to bomb Cuban sugar installations,
Letter classified "Secret" since it implies CIA is
engaged in activity directed against Cuba, the unauthorized
disclosure of which could cause serious damage to national
defense interests.

June 9, 1964
RE:
MOVIMIENTO INSURRECTIONAL DE
RECUPERACION REVOLUCIONARIA (MIRR)
INTERNAL SECURITY - CUBA
NEUTRALITY MATTERS
Previous investigation has reflected that Dr.
Orlando Bosch Avila, head of the MIRR, an anti-Castro organ-
isation at Miami, was compelled to abandon plans for an
attack upon the "Las Villas", a Cuban freighter, when this
vessel recently avoided the east coast of South Florida on a
voyage from Marseilles, France, to Havana, Cuba. This ship
departed Marseilles on May 4, 1964, and was scheduled to dock
in Havana on May 25, 1964.
On May 26, 1964, MM T-1, a Cuban exile who is
friendly with some of Bosch's close associates, advised that
Bosch has begun to lay new plans for another attack against
Cuba.
Current Investigation
On May 28, 1964, MM T-1 reported that on May 27,
1964, Jesus Sanchez/Martinez, who is also known as "Mimi",
and Evelio Alpizar Perez, associates of Bosch, went to
Orlando, Florida, upon instructions of Bosch, to examine two
airplanes with the view of renting one or both for the next
MIRR operation. MM T-1 said that Sanchez and Alpizar were
transported from Miami to Orlando, and return, by an American,
age about 47, 5'8" tall, weighing 180 pounds, black and gray
hair, known only as "Otis", and a friend of Bosch. "Otis"
was accompanied by his wife or girl friend, named "Carole".
MM T-1 said Bosch decided against renting either of these
planes at Orlando, both of which were owned by a medical
doctor, because of exorbitant rental fees demanded.
