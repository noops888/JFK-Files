DID NOT PROVIDE J/1
WITH THE NAME OF THE INDIVIDUAL).
SAID THAT THIS AMCIT
OFFERED TO SELL HIM A CASE OF BEER FOR ONE DOLLAR. WHEN J/1
SAID THAT THE AMERICAN WAS PROBABLY ONLY BEING FRIENDLY,
SAID THAT HE KNEW IT WAS BUSINESS AND NOT FRIENDSHIP
WHICH WAS BEHIND THE GENEROUS OFFER.
THEN RAISED THE
ISSUE OF A PUBLICATION WHICH LISTED PNINFINITE EMPLOYEES AROUND
THE WORLD.
ALSO RAISED THE BAY OF PIGS AND THE
*<ASSASSINATION>OF<PRESIDENT KENNEDY, >STATING THAT HE KNEW THEM
TO BE PNINFINITE OPERATIONS.
COMPLAINED THAT HE DID
NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE U.S WAS OBSESSED WITH CASTRO.
STATED THAT CUBA COULD OVERRUN THE AMERICAN BASES IN CUBA IN 5
MINUTES IF THEY WANTED TO DO SO. HE ALSO COMPLAINED ABOUT
AMERICAN IMPERIALISM, ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE TRADE EMBARGO. HE
BRAGGED ABOUT CUBA, PRAISING ITS DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES.

DURING THIS SESSION. DURING THE CONVERSATION,

MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE DID NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEM TALKING TO
AMERICANS, AND NAMED C/O'S DERSOOKIAN AND BECKNAP WHOM HE HAD
MET THROUGH J/1.
3. DURING THE CONVERSATION, J/1 SAID HE HEARD AN AUDIBLE
"CLICK" WHICH HE IS SURE WAS THE SOUND OF A TAPE RECORDER
SHUTTING OFF. J/1 SAID HE IGNORED THE SOUND, BUT BOTH HIS HOST
AND HOSTESS WERE SHOCKED BY THE NOISE. J/1 SAID THAT
SEEMED TO BE ALL BUSINESS THAT EVENING, ASKING QUESTIONS AND
LEADING THE CONVERSATION. WHEN J/1 PHONED HIM ON 13 SEP WITH A
PHONE NUMBER HE HAD REQUESTED,
SEEMED TENSE. ON 15
SEP,
CAME BY TO SEE J/1 AT HIS OFFICE, AGAIN REFERRING
TO HIM AS HIS BROTHER.
WAS BACK TO HIS PREVIOUSLY
FRIENDLY SELF AND ASKED J/1 WHAT HE WAS DOING OVER THE WEEKEND
AND J/1 SAID HE WAS VERY BUSY. J/1'S IMPRESSION IS THAT HE WAS
BEING TESTED AND THAT HE PASSED THE TEST. C/O SAID SHE WOULD
CONSULT THE WASHINGTON EXPERTS AND ADVISE J/1 AT NEXT MEETING
WHICH IS SCHEDULED FOR 1500 ON 24 SEP. WOULD APPRECIATE HQS
COMMENTS PRIOR TO THAT MEETING.
TOLD J/1 THAT HE WANTED THE
4. DURING THE MEETING,
BIBLE FOR HIMSELF SINCE HE WAS CATHOLIC. HE SAID THAT
PREVIOUSLY, PARTY MEMBERS COULD NOT BE RELIGIOUS AND REMAIN
PARTY MEMBERS. HOWEVER, THINGS HAD LIBERALIZED TO THE POINT
WHERE HE COULD NOW HAVE A BIBLE. (J/1 DID ADMIT THAT HE FORGOT
COULD NOT
TO ASK WHY, IF THINGS WERE MORE LIBERAL NOW,
GET HIS OWN BIBLE FROM CUBA.)
5. J/1 SAID THAT BASED ON HIS ASSESSMENT
STATION WOULD NOT GET FAR WITH HIM USING OFFICIAL AMERICANS.
HE SAID HOWEVER, THAT A SOUTH AMERICAN BUSINESSMAN INTERESTED
IN TRADE IN CUBA (SPECIFICALLY IMPORT/EXPORT) WOULD BE OF
INTEREST
J/1
AS HE HAS EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN LEAVING
THE GOVERNMENT AND INVOLVING HIMSELF IN BUSINESS DEALINGS.
ASSESSES
AS BEING INTERESTED IN MONEY (HENCE THE
INTEREST IN BUSINESS), BUT STILL RETAINING AN INTEREST IN
POLITICS. C/O TOLD J/1 THAT STATION AND HOS STILL HAD AN
INCOMPLETE PICTURE OF
PERSONALITY AND THAT HE SHOULD
CONTINUE WITH HIS ASSESSMENT. C/O AGAIN TRIED THE PLOY OF
HAVING J/1 WRITE A LETTER TO C/O DESCRIBING
HAD NEVER MET HIM. J/1 SAID HE WOULD TRY TO DO THẤT.
AS IF C/O

IT IS LIKELY THAT
DERSOOKIAN AND BECKNAP.
OFFICIAL INSISTED THAT
CONTACT WITH
HAS REPORTED HIS CONTACT WITH C/O'S
IT IS POSSIBLE THEN THAT A SECURITY
CONFIRM HIS VERSION OF THE
J/1. THE EVENTS OF 9
SEP WOULD SUPPORT THIS THEORY, ESPECIALLY THE OBVIOUS AGENDA
AND THE SHOCK AT THE MIX-UP WITH THE TAPE RECORDER (THIS IS NOT
A TRAINED PROFESSIONAL CONDUCTING A TEST.) ANOTHER POSSIBILITY
IS THAT THIS WAS A TEST FOR J/1, A SORT OF VETTING EXERCISE.
SINCE
CAME BACK TO J/1 AFTER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, IT
WOULD APPEAR THAT J/1 PASSED THE TEST. THE QUESTION REMAINS AS
TO WHO WAS ABLE TO REVIEW THE TAPE IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF
