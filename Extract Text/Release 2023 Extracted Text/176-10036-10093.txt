THIS IST UNEVALUATED INFORMATION. SOURCE GRADINGS ARE DEFINITIVE. APPRAISAL OF CONTENT IS TENTATIVE.
SOURCE AN AMERICAN OBSERVER (B); FROM NGO DINH NHU.
APPR NGO DINH NHU PROBABLY EXPRESSED THE VIEWS STATED AND WAS AWARE THAT THEY
WOULD REACH AMERICAN OFFICIALS.
1. IN LATE MARCH 1963 NGO DINH NHU SAID THAT HE DISAGREED WITH THE
POSITIONS APPARENTLY TAKEN BY SENATOR MANSFIELD AND GENERAL CLAY WHICH SEEMED
TO HIM TO IMPLY THE DESIRABILITY OF WITHDRAWAL OF AMERICAN AID AND PRESENCE
FROM CERTAIN COUNTRIES AND CONCENTRATION ON OTHER COUNTRIES. HE THOUGHT THAT
THE WITHDRAWAL OF AMERICAN AID AND PRESENCE FROM ANY COUNTRY IN WHICH THE
COMMUNIST PRESENCE AND ACTIVITIES CONSTITUTED A DANGER WOULD CREATE A VACUUM
WHICH THE COMMUNISTS WOULD FILL. HE EMPHASIZED SEVERAL TIMES THE DANGER OF
COMPLETE WITHDRAWAL.
2. AT THE SAME TIME, NHU STATED THAT HE RECOGNIZES THE NEED FOR
LESSENING THE BURDEN OF AID BY ACHIEVING A BETTER QUALITATIVE DISTRIBUTION AND

EFFECT OF AID WITHIN ANY GIVEN COUNTRY. HE SAID THAT FOR THE PAST TWO OR
THREE MONTHS, HE HAD COMMENTED ON PRESIDENT DIEM'S AND HIS OWN RECOGNITION
THAT SOUTH VIETNAM MUST ACHIEVE BETTER QUALITATIVE UTILIZATION OF AMERICAN
AID. HE REITERATED HIS CONCEPT OF SELF-SUFFICIENCY, HIS THEME THAT AN
UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRY SHOULD NOT BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO LIVING AT TOO
ARTIFICIALLY HIGH A STANDARD BASED ON FOREIGN AID, AND HE EXPRESSED THE
BELIEF THAT SOUTH VIETNAM IS MOVING TOWARD A BETTER "STRUCTURED" UTILIZATION
OF AID AND IS CONCENTRATING IT AT THE GRASS ROOTS AMONG THE PEASANTRY. HE
COMMENTED THAT URBAN INDUSTRIALIZATION AND OTHER FORMS OF URBAN DEVELOPMENT
DID NOT MEET THE NEEDS OF THE MASS OF PEOPLE AND PROVED TOO SLOW IN ACHIEVING
AN IMPACT. HE REMARKED THAT HE CONTINUES TO SEARCH FOR WAYS TO DIMINISH THE
LEVEL OF FOREIGN AID REQUIRED IN SOUTH VIETNAM AND BELIEVES ALSO THAT WAYS
SHOULD BE FOUND TO DIMINISH THE NUMBERS OF AMERICANS DEPLOYED THERE. HOWEVER,
NHU DID NOT IMPLY THAT ESSENTIAL AID OR ESSENTIAL AMERICAN PRESENCE SHOULD IN
ANY WAY BE DISCARDED:
3.
NHU SAID THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND CONGRESS TEND TO LOOK UPON
THE PROBLEM OF UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES AS AN ISOLATED PROBLEM ACCENTUATED
CRITICALLY BY THE COMMUNIST THREAT, AND TO CONSIDER. AID AND AMERICAN PRESENCE
MORE AS MEASURES IN THEMSELVES BY WHICH TO MEET THESE CRISES. ON THE OTHER
HAND, NHƯ AND DIEM SEE AMERICAN AID AND PRESENCE IN SOUTH VIETNAM, ACCORDING
TO NHU, GIVEN THE LARGE SCOPE OF THE PHENOMENA, AS A RAMIFYING "MEETING OF

CIVILIZATIONS." NHU SAID THAT DIEM HAD USED THIS EXPRESSION RECENTLY IN AN
INTERVIEW WITH AMERICAN REPORTERS TO MEAN THE MEETING OF WESTERN (AMERICAN)
CIVILIZATION WITH SOUTH VIETNAMESE CIVILIZATION. NHU REMARKED THAT THIS WAS
A FERMENTING PROCESS AND COULD HAVE "EXPLOSIVE" CONSEQUENCES FOR SOUTH VIETNAM.
NHU COMMENTED THAT THESE CONSEQUENCES OF THE "MEETING OF CIVILIZATIONS" WERE
INHERENT IN OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE FOREIGN AID AND PERSONNEL WERE PRESENT TO
A LARGE DEGREE. IN THIS CONNECTION, NHU SAID THAT COLONIALISM IN ITSELF HAD
NOT BEEN ALL BAD. REFERRING TO VIETNAM'S EXPERIENCE WITH THE FRENCH, NHU SAID
THAT THE WORST ASPECTS OF COLONIALISM HAD COME AT THE LOWER RANKS OR AT THE
BOTTOM OF THE FRENCH COLONIAL STRUCTURE AND THAT THEY HAD RESULTED FROM THE
ACTIVITIES OF FRENCH "ADVENTURERS," COMMERCIAL REPRESENTATIVES, AND LOWER
FUNCTIONARIES. HE ADDED THAT THESE KINDS OF REPRESENTATIVES WERE PRESENT ALSO
AMONG THE AMERICANS CURRENTLY IN SOUTH VIETNAM, WHILE, AT THE UPPER ECHELON OF
AMERICAN PRESENCE, THERE WERE MANY REPRESENTATIVES WHOSE ROLE WAS CONSTRUCTIVE
AND HELPFUL TO SOUTH VIETNAM.
4.
NHU CONTINUED BY EMPHASIZING THAT HE IS NOT ANTI-AMERICAN AND THAT
HE HOPED THAT HIS COMMENTS WOULD NOT BE MISCONSTRUED IN THAT SENSE. HE SAID
THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM HAS ATTEMPTED TO PROVIDE ITS PEOPLE WITH A.
CLEAR NATIONAL DOCTRINE AND THAT HE FELT THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD MADE CONSIDERABLE
PROGRESS IN ACHIEVING THIS GOAL. HE COMMENTED THAT IN HIS OPINION, THIS WAS NOT
THE CASE TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO, BUT HAS BECOME TRUE GRADUALLY DURING THE
