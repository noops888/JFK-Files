On January 8, 1963, a confidential informant,
who had furnished reliable information in the past, ad-
vised that he had learned that Geo. Castro Cermeza, Head
of the Cuban Revolutionary Council, an anti-Castro orga-
nization, was in Washington, D. C., and desired to see
Consalo Facio, Costa Rican Ambassador to the United States.
The informant later learned that Facio had
contacted Carras and had advised him that Juana Lynch,
Presidential candidate of the Nicaraguan Republic, is "raising the
money we have," Facio and Carras, according to the
informant, agreed to a further discussion to take place
on January 9, 1963.
