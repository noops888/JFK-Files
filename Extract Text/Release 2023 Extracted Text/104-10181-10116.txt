FBIS-37, 7 March 1967
Your memo of 3 March 1967 on Clay
Shaw's Connection with CIA
1. Attached for your information are copies of stories
from the 5 March 1967 issues of Il Messaggero (Attachment A)
and Corriere della Sera (Attachment B) concerning the New
Orleans investigation of a Kennedy assassination conspiracy
and the involvement therein of Clay Shaw. Shaw is identified
as having been connected with the Centro Mondiale Commerciale
(CMC). Other persons listed as involved with CMC are: Carlo
D'Amelio, Henrich Mandel-Mantello, George Mandel, and Ferenc
Nagy. No E/I traces were found on any of the above. No
Hungarian desk traces were found on Nagy. RID traces on all
four persons are in process.
2. In regard to the information in FBIS-37, a check of
E/I desk files disclosed no traces on the World Trading
Center, Clay Shaw, Major Blumenfeld, or PERMIDEX. Traces
were found (Attachment C) in the Annuario Parlamentare, 1963-
64 edition, on the CMC, which is noted as connected with
PERMINDEX. We believe that the CMC and PERMIDEX are identical,
respectively, with the World Trading Center and PERMIDEX
mentioned in FBIS-37. NO RID traces were found on CMC. The
1963-64 Annuario Parlamentare listed Nikolaus Fischer as managing
director of CMC. No E/I traces were found on Fischer. RID
traces on him are still in process.
3. A check of the 1963 and 1964 editions of the Annual
Swiss Business Registry, held by the Swiss desk, disclosed
further information on PERMINDEX (Attachment D), a commercial
firm with a wide range of activity located in Basel, Switzerland.
4. OCR/FID file information lists PERMINDEX as a Swiss
real estate and property management firm and lists its management
as follows:
President
Other Officials
Dr. Werner von Arx
Timothy Fales, Dr. Otto Wiesser,
Dr. Nikolaus Fischer, Randolph
Vetter.
