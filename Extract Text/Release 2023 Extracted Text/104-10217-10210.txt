1. Transmitted herewith as attachment A is a self-explanatory memorandum
prepared by KUDESK/100 on subject publication and on Richard Thomas GIBSON
who has recently set up headquarters in Lausanne. We have also attached the
newspaper clipping to which KUDESK/100 refers in paragraph 1 of its memorandum.
We would appreciate your querying liaison for any information they may have
in regard to this matter. Since the GRENVY information has not been cleared
for passage to liaison, we suggest that the New York Times article be used
as the basis for your query.
2. Attachment B is a summary of an OWY report, dated 19 April 1963,
on La Revolution Africaine and a number of the people involved in its publication.
It is forwarded for Station background use only.
