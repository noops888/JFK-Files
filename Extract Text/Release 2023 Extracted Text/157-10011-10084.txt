Hr.
a forner Miami Station maritime asset who was terminated
31 August 1972, informed Mr. Esterline that he and a
business friend, Hanolo Villapanen, had been contacted
frantically by the daughter or wife of Mr. Martinez requesting
innediate assistance in getting Mr. Martinez' car out of the
airport parking garage since it contained deeply compromising
material which had to be removed before the FBI got to it.
Esterline told Beguiristain that under no circumstances
should he become involved in this matter and relayed the
information to CIA Headquarters and the Miami Field Office.
A decision was made by CIA Headquarters to pass this informa-
tion to the FBI at the Headquarters level. At Mr. Esterline's
request Mr.Bequiristain obtained a description of the
automobile and its location in the garage.
prevented inmediate location of the car.
A faulty description
On the basis of a
corrected description the FBI on 19 June found and impounded
the car which in fact did contain a number of old documents
relating to maritime operations in the early 1960's and a note-
book, copies of which were made available to the Miami Station
by the FBI. In further coordination with the FBI tir. Esterline
confirned that Bernard Barker had been a CIA employee and
that Mr. Martinez, who was well known to the FBI to have been
a CIA employee, was no longer an active employee but was
maintained as an informant. Mr. Esterline advised the FBI
that there might be one or two telephone numbers in Mr.
Martinez' notebook relating to the Miani Station inasmuch as
Mr. Martinez had been provided a means of effecting emergency
contact with the Station. The FBI said it would be alert
to this possibility and accepted Mr. Esterline's statement
that the Station had been totally unaware of Mr. Martinez'
secret relations with Mr. Hunt. The FBI promised to avoid
disclosure of the fact that CIA had been instrumental in
helping them locate Mr. Martinez' car because of the problems
it could create for the source who had reported the matter to
CIA.
