SUMMARY OF INFORMATION: The Agency Operator advised that Subject was
calling requesting to speak to Mr. Colby.
Subject stated that he had just finished talking to "Air Chief
Marshall, Dawnee," Bangkok, Thailand and had some information that
he wanted to pass to Mr. Colby. Subject was informed that the
Director was not available and that the undersigned would take a
message and insure that the Director was informed of his call.
Subject declined SDO's invitation to leave a message and requested

the call.
Files in SR&CD reflect that Subject is generally categorized as a
con man, unscrupulous, wheeler-deeler and a promoter of grandiose
schemes.
