1 Evaluation of Contract Management Institute
Course
1, I attended the Contract Management Institute on 28 to
31 March 1967. Immediately after that course I submitted ex-
tonsive comments to Mr. Arthur Leach, DD/S&T coordinator for the
course, and I understand that those comments were included in
the overall recommendations for future changes.
2.
Since three and one-half months have transpired since
completion of that course, details such as the names of speakers
and subject material are a bit hazy but I will repeat my overall
-renction to it for whatever benefit it might afford. The course
material was good although it could have been oriented much more
toward technical project managers rather than administrative
officers, to the ultimate benefit of DD/S&T. Two of the speakers
wore excellent; however, the third, who also was apparently
Director of the Institute was very poor both with respect to his
understanding of the material and his presentation. Dr. Xennedy
of Notre Dame and the lawyor, whose name I do not recall, vere
excollent.
3. This was primarily a sales pitch for CPIF contracts.
My personal impression was that U.S. Government contracting agen-
cies have just about completed the circle of a great procurement
fiasco. In departing from fixed-price and CPFF contracts to CPIP'B
with various award arrangemonts, the contract negotiators wero
unable to really ever define cost and ended up invariably in
giving away additional foes to the contractors for nothing received。
Definitive costs were always a function of experienced and sound

Course
technical investigation and management of a contract and when-
ever costs followed a nonlinear curve, most estimates became
almost completely unpredictable. NASA and the DoD generally have,
therefore, gone from CPIF types to CPAF-type contracts; the CPAP
type ends up being simply another CPFF but with the contractor
having the advantage in the establishment of an award fee and
with the Government having no recourse to redetermination. My
reaction was simply that the DoD experience simply reaffirms my
own -- that for R&D there appears to be no good substitute for
a well-managed CPFF-type arrangement.
