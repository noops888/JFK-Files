LIENVOY-8
ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCE
1. As a result of the recent review done of the LIFEAT
and LIENVOY Project, it came to Headquarters attention that
LIENVOY-8, who was believed to have been terminated, was still
covered by the LIENVOY Project.
2. According to OMA-14676, LIENVOY-8 was the cause of
a security problem for LIENVOY in February 1960 when he requested
release from LIENVOY and a transfer to his parent organization, the
LIENVOY-8 was described as a
"sour" nationalist who disapproved of ODYOKE's sharing of the
LIENVOY take.
3. Headquarters now notes that LIENVOY-8's clearance has
never been cancelled and there is no Agent Service Record or
termination report in his file. LIENVOY-8 was included in the
LIENVOY Project renewal request for the 1961/62 project year, but
not for the 1962/63 year. The field project renewal request for
the 1963/64 year included him again.
4. It is requested that the Station inform Headquarters of
the present status of LIENVOY-8 (201-118406). If he has been
terminated, please forward an Agent Service Record. If he is
still being used, please provide a current analysis of his relia-
bility and comments on any security problems present in light of
his actions and reputation in 1960.
