Operations Services Group/OSS (SStetson)
Chief, Denver Field Office
Headquarters Inquiry re Private Intelligence Organization,
Denver, Colorado
Stetson/Walker telcon, 25 June 1973
As per referenced telcon, following your initial inquiry on
20 June 1975 ve agarched our memories for any clue to to an an organ organisation
in the Derver sres such as the one described in the Corman novepaper
article. It is quite likely hat an organisation staffed with
ex-government types and and performing such things as telephone tape for
wealthy private citizens would have come to our actantion through one
of our many contacts 10 to the area. We could think of cone that matched
your description and vo let the matter drop
2. On 24 June ve received a phone call from a local agent of
the KBI who had received the same information that you had passed on
uo and was trying to run it down. We again dented any knowledge of
such an organization. However, as the matter was rohashed among the
DFO staff we recalled that a few months ago, shortly after the CIA
expose first appeared in the New York Times, we received in the mall a
brochure from The Wackenhut Corporation, 262 Havana, Denver, Colorado A-1545.51
This organization was described as a private investigative service
with capabilities beyond that of the average private investigator in
that they are staffed with men and women formerly employed by the FBI,
Secret Service and DIA. He also believe that under the list of
services they offered was some type of electronic surveillance. Since
this type of organization is of no interest to us we discarded the
brochure and forgot about it until your inquiry prompted us to recall
ft.
3. We passed the above information on to the local Bureau office,
stressing that this was indeed a long shot, that our memory of the
contents of the brochure is vague at best, that we kave no reason to
believe that the Wackenhut Corporation is anything other than what it
advertises itself to be, and that thin is our best recollection but even
at that we are not absolutely sure it was the Wackenhut Corporation that
was mentioned in the brochure.
4. With this memorandum we merely wish to go on record with you an
having passed the above information to the local FBI office in the form
stated.
