CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
OPERATIONS - MIAMI AREA
Liaison
1- Mr. Papich AC
Reference is made to Bureau letter dated October 5,
1961, concerning Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) activities
in Miami. The Bureau Liaison representative met with a CIA
official on October 19, 1961, and the following information
was developed:
(1) The administrative organization which was
established to support the Cuban invasion has been dismantled.
(2) A cover firm bearing the name Zenith Technical
Enterprise, which ostensibly is a commercial business in the
electronics field, already has space located at Richmond, Florida,
on the south campus at the University of Miami. This firm is
not yet "open for business" but will be operating in the very
near future.
(3) The afore-mentioned firm is not being established
for the purpose of directing any intelligence operations. It
essentially will serve as a cover or backstop for certain CIA
employees in the Miami area. Such employees will have credit
cards, et cetera, identifying them with the firm.
(4) All duties being performed by these CIA employees
will be related to operations which have targets in Cuba. This
can include sabotage, harassment, planting agents in Cuba and
arranging for escapes of agents.
REC- 1262-86750-3850
(5) In addition to the above-described cover firm,
CIA will have a small installation approximately a mile from
Richmond. This will operate under Department of the Army cover.
Although details are not known, it is believed that this will be
used by the Agency's Security Officers, Gregory Merucaland Willian
Hecialty chese two men are in possession of Department of Army(5) (U)
identity cards.

(6) Another installation to be used by CIA is
located at Stock Island in the Keys. (William Hicks Panother
Security Officer, who is known to the Miami Office is stationed
at this base which was also used in connection with the Cuban
invasion. The nature of the activities on Stock Island is
unknown. The installation operates under the cover name of
Mineral Carriers.
(U)
(7) Apparently none of the installations described
will be used for any extensive training operation. The Liaison
Agent was informed that any training conducted by CIA would not
involve more than two or three individuale at any one time.
(U)
The above is being furnished to you for your confidential
information. This does not necessarily present the complete

in protecting Bureau jurisdiction and interests.
