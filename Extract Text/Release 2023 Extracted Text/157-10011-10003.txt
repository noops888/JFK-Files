On August 12, 1960 the Special Group heard a summary of the budget for Cuban
operations from MR. BISSELL. Approximately million dollars were required
to finance Cuban operations for the fiscal year and a balance of
vas
necessary for the remainder of the fiscal year. Major subheadings in the budget
were (1) political action, (2)-propaganda, (3)-pa-rami-l-i-ta-ry, (4) intelligence
collection, (5) counterintelligence, (6) communications support, (7) support.
It was agreed "This matter should be laid before the appropriate higher authori-

OCCURRENCE: Lansdale traces the history of the project from its inception on Nov. 30,
1961 through March 1, 1962. Under the latter date, he notes, "The Chief of Operations
/Lansdale/is to report to the President through the Special Group (NSC 5412 Augmented
by the Attorney General and the Chairman, JCS); the Special Group will be responsible for
providing policy guidance for approving important operations, and for monitoring progress."
(00181) Lansdale also submitted an intelligence plan for basic intelligence collection
upon which to base the decision to undertake actions to cause the overthrow of Castro.
The plan itself-at-pages-00183-through-00187, included establishing intelligence
inside Cuba; collecting intelligence from Cubans inside the United States; counterfeiting
ration cards and currency inside of Cuba; geographical surveys of air fields, military
installations, communications centers; attempts to place trained agents inside the government
organizations or to defect officials "in place"; and negotiating for British help in
contaminating lubricants and fuels to cripple Cuban transportation. "The British want to
know, 'how serious are you?', before risking their assets to help the U.S.". (00180-00187)

OCCURRENCE: Memo for Richard Helms from Gen. Lansdale concerning NSA cover. The memo
alludes to a conversation on the previous day, Jan. 31, 1962, about NSA cover for the
Cuba Project. It indicates that Cuba cover is top priority. It indicated that this was not
possibly known to the members of the United States Intelligence_Board. The problem seemed to
be to be able to decide how much of NSA (National Security Agency)'s assets were needed to
provide cover for the Cuban project.
