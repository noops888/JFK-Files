1. Thi's Agency is recently in receipt of information on
Subject and on Cuban activities in the United States which
might be of "interest to the Bureau. It is as follows:
"There are more Fidelistas here than in Cuba.
There are a great number of individuals infiltrated
into the counter-revolutionary circles. They are col-
lecting money to send to the Cuban Government. I
understand that they are very active in all fields.
"Menoyo's men are undesirable. GUTIERREZ Menoyo
came to New York" (no date given), apparently on the
express orders of Fidel. Almost all of them were G-2
agents, which they were in Cuba; and it is known that
Menoyo has had a series of meetings with Spanish
republican elements to see how he can get his hand
in Spain. Almost all of these republicans are Communists.
"In Miami, there are also many people working on
behalf of the Communists, above all the women."
2. The material above was sourced by a Spanish service.
