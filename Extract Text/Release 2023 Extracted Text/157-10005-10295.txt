In 1974 the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) spent
24
at least million in countries ranging from China to
cind for "covert action." Covert action is secret action
to influence events in foreign countries which is so designed
that, if discovered, official U.S. government participation
can be plausibly denied. In its attempts to influence events
it is distinguishable from clandestine intelligence gathering
often referred to as espionage.

What is the legal authority for the CIA to conduct covert
actions? This paper is one of a series that will attempt to
answer the question. It will first examine the predecessor
agencies to the CIA in order that the establishment of the
CIA may be placed in historical perspective. Next, it will
set out the legislative history of the National Security Act
of 1947, the basic charter of the CIA, and the National
Security Council directives which instructed the CIA to con-
duct various forms of covert action. Finally, it will present
a legal analysis of the 1947 Act. Other papers in the series
will examine the impact on the CIA's authority to conduct
covert action of Congressional provision of funds of the CIA,
