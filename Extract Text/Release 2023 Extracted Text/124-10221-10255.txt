Pedro Ipis Diaz Lens, former chief of the Cuban
Air Force, on July 2, 1959, advised our Miami Office he had
departed Cuba in secrecy on June 29, 1959, after he had been severely
reprimanded and ordered to perform no further duties as an Air Force
officer by Fidel Castro. He revealed he was reprimanded because of
a news release to radio, television and newspaper outlets in Cuba
in which he expressed opposition to any type of a dictatorship
whether it be Trujillo, Batista or communist.
Diaz advised he is deeply concerned over the placing
of communists in key positions in the Cuban Government and the
armed forces by Fidel Castro and his brother, Raul Castro. He
revealed that communist indoctrination classes have been held
for members of the Cuban Army and he claimed that he refused to
allow such classes to be scheduled for the Air Force. He indicated
that many Cuban soldiers were refusing to attend the classes
