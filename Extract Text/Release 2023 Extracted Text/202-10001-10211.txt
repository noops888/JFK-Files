ACTIVITY
PURPOSE
CONSIDERATIONS
[A]
22. "Voice of Free Cuba" broadcasts from
submarine. (CIA, with Defense support).
23. Continue "Radio Americas" broadcasts
from Swan Island as appropriate.
(CIA).
24. Make available to the International
Narcotics Commission documented
evidence of Cuban exportation/impor-
tation of narcotics. (State).
25. Arrange for caches of limited Soviet-
Czech arms to be "discovered" in
selected Latin American countries,
ostensibly smuggled in from Cuba. (CIA).
To have a "voice" for resistance
inside Cuba.
To provide an irritant to the Castro/
Communist regime.
To create increased awareness
in Latin America of Cuban sub-
versive activities.
To sow and increase distrust in
Latin America of the Castro/
Communist regime.
The initial broadcasts indicated that this
can be made into an effective medium, at
small risk. In strengthening the effectiveness,
full use should be made of talents in the Cuban
refugee community. CIA will coordinate this
activity closely with State and USIA.
Documented evidence available or obtainable
should be fully exploited for impact upon
hemisphere and world opinion.
This activity will be undertaken only on a
spot basis, coordinated with U.S. objectives
in the specific country.

Each operation entails risk, not only physical
risk for the saboteurs, but also risk of attri -
bution to the U.S. in case of capture. Care
will be taken to give these actions the appear -
ance of being done by internal resistance
groups, and in isolating team members from
press sources upon return. The U.S. handling
of information, in case of contingency, will be
established by CIA in coordination with USIA
and State.

PURPOSE
CONSIDERATIONS
34. (continued)
35. Spot, recruit, and train third
country nationals resident in Cuba.
(CIA, supported by State and Defense).
36. Spot, recruit and train legal travellers
who have potential access to significant
information. (CIA, supported by State
and Defense).
37. Continue Caribbean Admissions Center,
Opa-locka, Florida. (CIA, with Defense,
USIA, and other support).
In addition to meeting the above
cited intelligence objectives,
operational intelligence, and re-
cruitment leads as well as agent
material result from the Opa-locka
and Madrid operations. In addition
to meeting basic intelligence re-
quirements above, timely opera -
tional intelligence is vital to CIA
current operations.
See 34 above.
See 34 above.
See 34 above.
The continuation of the refugee flow and
the selective debriefing of refugees provide
the most significant source of intelligence.
Follow up debriefing of selected refugees
after departure from Opa-locak will
continue.

38. Continue joint Spanish IS/CIA interro -
gation center Madrid. (CIA)
See 34 above.
39. Maintain PAA service between the U.S.
and Cuba. (State, with CIA support).
40. Continue and expand, as practical,
communications intelligence coverage
of Cuban communications nets.
(Defense and CIA).
41. Continue monitoring overt Cuban
broadcasts. (CIA).od
42. Urge, assist, and/or support friendly
third country intelligence services to
expand their intelligence coverage of
Cuban intelligence requirements. (CIA).
To provide intelligence and agent
personnel and documentation, as
well as to continue the exodus of
skilled manpower from Cuba.
See 34 above.
To obtain intelligence and propa -
ganda material.
See 34 above.
Due to local conditions and problems, the
Madrid Debriefing Center will continue to
be more limited in size and selective in
choice of refugees than Opa-locka. This
is primarily an NSA problem but CIA will
continue to assist as practicable.
PAA requires financial assistance to con-
tinue this activity.
It is recognized that significant increase in
coverage of the internal micro-wave system
would become a major budget and personnel
problem.
This is done on a regular, basis by FBIS.
This will be handled through existing
liaison channels."!!
