THE 201 SYSTEM
Rescission: Annex B of Chapter III, PLB 70-1-1, 27 October 1966
REPRODUCTION
PROHIBITED
1. INTRODUCTION
The 201 system provides a method for identifying a person of specific in-
terest to the Operations Directorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent
information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying
subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for
producing lists of 201 personalities according to those categories. Only a rela-
tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify
opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and
CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-
zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre-
spondence has accumulated.
2. THE 201 SYSTEM
The principal features of the 201 system are:
a. The 201 Number: a unique number, i.e., 201-1234567, assigned to each
individual in the system to serve as the identifying file number for reporting on that
individual.
b. The 201 Dossier: the official file containing the 201 opening form (Form
831) and all biographic reporting on and references to the individual, i.e., per-
sonal history, current status and prospects.
REPRODUCTION
PROHIBITED
c. The Master 201 Record: a machine record generated by the opening of
a 201 file. This record produces the master 201 reference for the Main Index and
stores the pertinent information which may later be retrieved for special listings.
d. Main Index Master 201 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an
Index Search Request, is printed as illustrated below. When data are absent
within the record, succeeding data items or lines will be moved up and the ref-
erence consolidated.

e. OI Code: a two letter symbol used in the 201 system to record the
association of an individual with organizations or activities of intelligence and security service affiliation whether staff or
suspect, as well as activities of interest. The OI codes cover intelli-
gence and security service affiliation whether staff or
suspect, as well as activities of interest. The OI codes for use by
components are two categories of OI codes:
(1) general OI codes
(2) OI codes assigned to a specific component for intelligence services
or other specific organizations
A component may request an OI code be established by submitting a mem-
orandum to the DDO/RMO through the component Records Management
Officer.
A 201 personality may be assigned two OI codes. An OI code may be assigned
when the 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) is initiated (see
paragraph 3b below) by filling in Box 13 or a code may be assigned or added
at a later date by a Form 831 amendment.
The 201 system has the capability of producing machine listings of 201
personalities by OI codes. For example, if an OI code has been opened for the
security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members
of that service.
f. 201 Machine Lists: produced from the mechanized 201 Index, based on
names or other identifying information of personalities on whom 201 dossiers
exist.
3. OPENING A 201 DOSSIER
a. General
REPRODUCTION
PROHIBITED
The opening of a 201 dossier is the prerogative of an operational com-
ponent, in coordination with the Operations Services Group. An opening creates
a master 201 record. Changes to the master record and the occasional closing
of a 201 dossier are controlled jointly by the desks and ISC. 201 dossiers may be
opened on persons who meet the recording criteria described in Chapter II of this
handbook, when there is a reasonable expectation that additional information
will be acquired and filed in such a dossier. Generally dossiers are opened on:
persons about whom counterintelligence information is being reported, and per-
sons of operational interest to the Operations Directorate, specifically those
persons for whom provisional operational approvals and operational approvals
are requested (see exception below). 201 files are not to be opened on staff
employees, staff agents and most categories of contract employees. Files on

persons who are only of local interest to a field station or Headquarters desk
and on whom no DDO records correspondence exists are not a part of the DDO
records system and are to be maintained by that unit. Some desks levy require-
ments on ISG for automatic 201 openings on certain categories of persons whose
names appear in incoming dispatches. These are listed in Attachment 2. 201
dossiers should be opened on the following categories:
(1) Subjects of provisional operational approval and operational ap-
proval requests. However, 201 files need not be opened when a POA is requested
for persons being trained for a foreign liaison service and who are of opera-
tional interest for training purposes only.
(2) Persons for whom the field requests a 201 opening.
(3) MHFIXTURE personalities: bonafide diplomats of other than
denied area countries, in close association with staff personnel.
(4) Subjects of a Personal Record Questionnaire Part I.
(5) Persons on whom a Main Index search reveals information in five
or more documents (see DOI 70-20).
(6) Subjects of Interagency Source Register memoranda from LSN/
ISR (opened only by IP/RMS).
b. Requesting a 201 File Opening
Headquarters desks may open a 201 file by filling out and submitting
a 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) to the Records Main-
tenance Section (IP/RMS). Form 831 is also used to create or amend the
master 201 record and to register the assignment of a cryptonym to a 201
personality. Attachment 2 lists the criteria for opening and amending 201's. A field
station may request the opening of a 201 file by writing 201- in the Head-
quarters file or cross-references box on the dispatch form and/or after the
subject's name in the body of the dispatch. A telepouch request for a 201 opening
is made by indicating 201- in the file number line. A cable request is made by
placing 201- after the term "File" on the last line of the transmission. IP/AN
will open 201 files as requested by dispatch or telepouch but it is the responsi-
bility of the desk to respond to cable requests. Field stations are notified of
201 openings through receipt of the field master 201 record.

4. CONTENTS OF THE DOSSIER
Information about a 201 personality should be filed or cross-referenced into
his dossier. When additional information is discovered on a 201 subject through
a name trace or other process, i.e., review of predecessor documents, it must
be consolidated into his personality dossier. See DOI 70-20 for consolidation
procedures. Material which is filed in the dossier includes but is not limited to:
a. 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831).
b. Biographic information, including photographs, fingerprints, and
handwriting samples.
c. Personal Record Questionnaire Parts I and II.
d. Operational and other security approvals.
e. Name check replies, requests, clearances, and approvals.
f. Acknowledgement of pseudonym.
g. 201 personality assessments and evaluations.
h. Copy of contract and termination papers.
i. Secrecy agreement.
j. Agent Duty Status Report.
k. Training and evaluation.
l. SGSWIRL reports.
m. Newspaper clippings.
REPRODUCTION
PROHIBITED
n. Any other material which may provide a better understanding of the
subject and our interest in him. This may include operational reporting.
5. MAINTENANCE OF 201 DOSSIERS
The 201 personality dossier contains, in document date order, papers which
have been made a part of the Central Records System as well as those which
have not. Record documents may range from newspaper or magazine articles
on the subject to finance and other administrative papers.

CHAPTER III, ANNEX B
15 November 1974
a. Purging
Purging a 201 dossier is the responsibility of the desk officer. It requires
discrimination in recognizing operationally useful material, rather than the
simple distinction between official and unofficial papers; it will therefore take
place under the supervision of a Records Officer. Purging should be done
periodically. A 201 dossier being forwarded to Central Files for retention should
be purged. A 201 dossier should be purged of the following:
(1) Duplicate material, i.e., extra copy(s) of a document.
(2) Name trace material which is not the basis for a document since
the opening.
(3) All abstract slips.
(4) All document restriction notices (Form 1884) unless it has been the basis for
the opening.
(5) The disseminated version of positive intelligence information if
a copy of the raw report is contained in the 201 file; the dissemination number
then must be transferred to the first page of the raw report.
(6) Routing slips, routing and record sheets (Form 610) and dispatch
cover sheets unless there are remarks such as coordinations or comments.
(7) Record copy documents which only repeat substantive information
contained in other documents in the file; authorization for destruction is
by the Records Officer.
(8) Top Secret documents are not to be retained in a 201 dossier
forwarded to Central Files; the document must be downgraded for retention
in the 201 dossier. To downgrade a Top Secret document, an authorized
officer in the originating office or the Records Officer having jurisdiction
over the contents of the material must possess Top Secret classification
authority. If the document cannot be downgraded the file should be
returned to the originating office and a cross-reference sheet (Form 867) placed
at the desk or forwarded to the Top Secret Control Officer, giving the location
of the TS document.
(9) Deferred documents (see 5b(2)).
b. Maintenance Procedures
(1) All material in a 201 dossier will be filed in document date order.
In the case of document attachments which have been classified into a 201

dossier and separated from the basic document by the assignment of a slash
number, the attachment will be filed by the date of the basic document.
(2) Deferred documents will not be filed in a 201 dossier. If they are
to be retained in the dossier they should be sent to RXRMS for classification
into that 201.
(3) Field index cards (used by some desks) and area desk cards may
be retained in the 201 as part of a consolidation procedure. These cards
should be mounted on a half-size sheet of paper for filing in the 201.
(4) A 201 dossier provisionally opened on a person who becomes a staff
employee and which contains Record Copy documents will be restricted to
the ISG/DIP unless the desk retains the restriction. The dossier should be
closed if there are no Record Copy documents in it.
(5) A 201 opened in pseudonym should be consolidated into the true
name 201 if one exists or converted to the true name.
(6) Field and duplicate (shadow) 201 files no longer of active interest
should be incorporated into the official 201 after the duplicate material
has been purged by the desk officer and the remaining information classified
to that 201 by the Analysis Section (IP/AN).
(7) Any document with a predecessor organization cover sheet or an
OPC (Office of Policy Coordination) cover sheet from the Archives and
Disposition Section (IP/ARD) must be returned to IP/ARD for processing
to the 201.
(8) Desk memoranda (memoranda without a document source number)
containing subrogatory information on the subject of the 201 should be sent
to IP/AN to be classified officially into the 201 file.
(9) An attachment separated from its basic document which should be separat-
ed for inclusion in a 201 Personality File Action Request dossier will be forwarded with the basic
document to IP/AN for processing into the 201.
(10) To retain the P&L, RYBAT, or KAPOK sensitivity of a document
remaining in a 201 dossier being retired to Central Files, place that document
in an envelope sealed with black tape (see DOI 70-17). Any RYBAT, P&L,
or KAPOK document sent to Central Files not in a black-taped envelope will
automatically be handled as desensitized. A black-taped envelope may con-
tain only one document and must be filed in chronological order within the
file. If there are numerous documents of this type the desk officer may black-
tape the entire dossier rather than individual documents (see DOI 70-10).

for the charge of a restricted dossier or any document within a restricted dossier
held in Central Files will be forwarded with the entire dossier and a multiple-
routed cover sheet to the restricting desk. This desk may then forward the file
to the requester or deny the request and return the dossier to Central Files. The
desk will notify the requester of a denial.

8. REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION ON 201 PERSONALITIES
The Automated Index Section (IP/AIS) will provide the identity of the
subject of a 201 number unless the 201 file is restricted, in which case the
requester will be referred to the restricting desk.
IP/AIS will also provide the 201 number assigned to a name, unless the 201
file is restricted, or state that there is no 201 number assigned. Requesters should
supply identifying information whenever available for each name submitted.
Requests pertaining to five or fewer names or numbers may be made by
telephone by calling the IP/AIS red line extension; IP/AIS will provide the
information by return call to the requester's extension as listed in the Badge
Table. Requests for more than five names or numbers must be listed and sent
by tube or courier to IP/AIS; IP/AIS will reply by return mail.
9. 201 DOSSIER CANCELLATION
A 201 file may be authorized for cancellation by a Records Officer, after
appropriate coordination. The file should be forwarded to IP/RMS which will
destroy the folder and the cards leading to it and will remove the name and
number from machine lists. Any Record Copy document contained in the folder
will be reclassified to another appropriate file or sent to the Destruction Unit
(IP/DU) as directed by the desk Records Officer.
10. 201 MACHINE LISTINGS
Machine listings provide field stations and Headquarters desks with names
and 201 numbers in the requester's particular geographic or functional area of
interest. If a component wishes to exclude a sensitive 201 personality from its
alphabetic, numeric, and cryptonym listings, this may be done when opening
the 201 or later by a 201 amendment. On the 201 Personality File Action Request
(Form 831) leave the country of location (Box 15) and interest desk (Box 16)
blank, use the non-country code 900 in the action code box (Box 14), and indicate
permanent charge to the responsible desk. The only listing which will include the
201 number is the IP/201 record for the Vital Records program. 201 listings are
categorized as standard or nonstandard and as scheduled or special.
