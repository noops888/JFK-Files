BACKGROUND DATA AND COMMENTS:
GYROSE
Source: The information attached to this report fell into
the hands of JMWAVE through two distinct channels. Sometime
prior to 7 July 1962 AMCOG-2 through a cut-out had delivered
to AMBLEAK-2 some material. AMCOG-2 does not know ANBLEAK-2.
AMBLEAK-2 brought it out to AMBLEAK-1 who on 7 July 1962
turned the "pouch" over to HAWLOTT, AMBLEAK-l's C/O, C/o
intercepted this "pouch" and xeroxed the cover pages of the
reports which were generated by ALIMPEX; the material was
The
62then re-inserted in the "pouch" and sent on its way.
ALIMPEX reports scheduled for the AMSPELL organization. It
Is assumed that the AMSPELL received the material in due
course, and they in turn delivered the material to NOEMAYR (P)
the AMSPELL C/O, on or about 19 July.
This is the background to a story which now gains new
importance. The information which was copied by HAWLOTT is
not reflected in toto in the material eventually received
by NOEMAYR, thus the xeroxed copies of some of the documents,
original copies for which were not received from the AMSPELL
organization.

REPORT COVER SHEET (continued)
Operational security precludes a confrontation of the AMSPELL
organization, therefore Headquarters will have to be satisfied
with copies of the original documents for some of the import/
export items, and with xeroxed copies of merely the cover sheets
for some of the other items
This whole sad story has had one positive reaction. On 24 July
1962 at 1930 hours NOEMAYR and PAPOCK will be visiting the intel-
ligence components of the AMSPELL organization to see what type
of information they might have which does not, has not, and
probably was not going to be forwarded to NOELAYR
Place acquired changed to Cuba to facilitate dissemination.
According to the DRE the ultimate source is a girl in the Ministry
of Commerce. The covering note from the DRE in Cuba to the DRE
in exile pointed out that these documents were originals, and that
the information in them is available to Dorticos, Fidel, Carlos
Rafael Rodriguez and two or three other people. An evaluation
of this material would be appreciated from KULYNX.
PLEASE NOTE: The enclosed attachments are unique. There are no
other copies available.
