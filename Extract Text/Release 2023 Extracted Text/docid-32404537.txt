DCI Sources and Methods Authority With Respect
to JFK Assassination Records
1. Per your request, I have attached a copy of the
President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of
1992 (ARCA), Pub. L. 102-526, 106 Stat. 3443-3458, reprinted at
For your convenience, I have highlighted
44 U.S.C. § 2107 note.
the pertinent provisions that will aid in responding to an
inquiry regarding the statute's effect on the DCI's statutory
authority to protect intelligence sources and methods.
2. The clear language and intent of the law is to supersede
statutes that prohibit disclosure of information, except for some
The statute
irrelevant subject areas, such as tax records.
provides that "it shall take precedence over any other law
(except section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code), judicial
decision construing such law, or common law doctrine that would
otherwise prohibit" the disclosure of information subject to the
Act.
ARCA § 11(a).
This language, taken with the provisions
discussed below which limit the intelligence sources and methods
that may be protected and set a strict procedural scheme by which
information is to be reviewed under the ARCA, effectively
supersedes the DCI's National Security Act authority with respect
to intelligence sources and methods information subject to the
ARCA.
3.
Section 6 of the ARCA provides the grounds for which the
The statute
release of information may be "postponed."
contemplates that all information will eventually be released.
Indeed, it specifies that all information will be made available
to the public no later than 25 years after the passage of the
ARCA (which occurred in October 1992) unless the president
certifies that continued postponement is necessary.
ARCA
§ 4(g) (2) (D). With respect to intelligence-related information,
ARCA allows postponement if:
"(1) the threat to
intelligence operations
is
of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest, and
such public disclosure would reveal--

Assassination Records
(A) an intelligence agent whose identity currently
requires protection;
(B) an intelligence source or method which is
currently utilized, or reasonably expected to be
utilized, by the United States Government and which has
not been officially disclosed, the disclosure of which
would interfere with the conduct of intelligence
activities; or
(C) any other matter currently relating to
intelligence operations
the disclosure of which
would demonstrably impair the national security of the
United States."
ARCA § 6(1) (Emphasis added.)

ARCA
The originating agency is to make the first review to
identify information that meets the standards for postponement.
ARCA § 4(c) (2) (D) (i). For CIA, this effort is being undertaken
by the Historical Review Group, in consultation with the
Directorate of Operations and other appropriate Agency
components. Information the originating agencies identify for
postponement must be transmitted to the Review Board.
§ 4 (c) (2)(Ε). The Review Board "shall consider and render
decisions on a determination by a Government office to seek to

postpone the disclosure of assassination records."
7(i)(1). Specifically, the "Review Board shall consider and
render decisions on
whether an assassination record or
particular information in a record qualifies for postponement of
disclosure under the Act." ARCA § 7(i) (2) (B).
5.
...
If the Review Board determines to order the disclosure
of information that the originating agency feit met the criteria
for postponement, it "shall notify the head of the originating
body of its determination and publish a copy of the determination
in the Federal Register within 14 days after the determination is
made." ARCA § 9(c) (4) (A). If the information contained in an
assassination record is "obtained or developed solely within the
executive branch, the President shall have the sole and
nondelegable authority to require the disclosure or postponement
of
the information under the standards set forth in
Section 6." ARCA § 9(d) (1) (emphasis added). The President's
decision must be certified to the Review Board within 30 days of
the Review Boards determination. Id. Records postponed by the
President must be re-reviewed every 5 years. ARCA § 9 (d) (2).

Dear John:

A few months ago we made a request to the Department of Defense for, inter alia,
"Any available MOUs or MOAs defining command responsibilities and
lines of authority, responsibility and accountability when individuals of
the Central Intelligence Agency serve under 'military cover,' i.e., are
employed and operate for the CIA while wearing the uniform of the
armed services. (Applicable period of interest here is 1956-64.)"
This letter is our official notification to you that we have made the above-stated request.
We understand that the Agency was advised of this request by the Department of
Defense at the time the request was made. We do, however, apologize for our
inadvertent error in not having provided you with a contemporaneous notification.
Sincerely,
Sione

In accordance with the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act
of 1992, I am writing to inform you that the Assassination Records Review Board has
made additional formal determinations concerning the public disclosure of CIĄ
records at its meeting on December 15, 1997.
Enclosed is a list of the determinations that the Review Board has made. These
decisions were premised on several factors, including the historical interest in the
documents and the absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause
harm to the United States or to any individual.
You have seven days to appeal these decisions to the President. You are invited to send
your representative to the Review Board to examine our copies of the documents for
which determinations have been made and to discuss the determinations with my staff.

Assassination Records Review Board
Review Guidelines
for Information Relating to Official Cover
This document sets forth the review guidelines for use by the Assassination Records Review Board
("Board" or "ARRB") and the Central Intelligence Agency ("CIA" or "Agency") for public release of
certain information concerning the identity, scope, details, and specific mechanisms of official cover
(hereafter "official cover details"). These guidelines have been officially adopted by the Board to serve the
public interest in making the complete story of the JFK assassination available while protecting from
official disclosure information which would be harmful to the national security and is properly classified
under Executive Order 12958.
1. Information in documents originated by the Congress (most often in the context of personal
statements to committees or committee staffs) which sets forth official cover details shall be presumptively
released unless it sets forth specific information not generally known to the public or the Agency shall be
able to demonstrate that it has taken affirmative action to prevent the disclosure of such information in the
past and that release here would cause identifiable damage to the national security.
2. Information in documents originated by the Executive Branch (including those designated by the
parties as quasi-executive branch documents which reflect extracts from the records of the Executive
Branch) which sets forth official cover details shall be presumptively postponed to the extent that it
concerns:
•
•
identification of the official cover provider,
specific locations used for official cover, and
identity, scope, details and mechanisms of any particular official cover.
3. Information in such documents which the Executive Branch has taken an affirmative act to
officially disclose or allow to be disclosed shall be presumed to be releasable.
4. Moreover, information in such documents which relates to individuals who are considered
important to the story of the assassination shall, consistent with past practice, be considered for release on
an individual basis with the Agency having a higher standard of proof of damage to the national security.
5. For any information postponed pursuant to these Guidelines, the Agency agrees to provide a
summary or substitution which preserves the content and relevance of the postponed information.
Neither these guidelines nor the release of documents pursuant to these guidelines shall be deemed
to constitute an official Executive Branch acknowledgment of the identity, scope, details, and specific
mechanisms of official cover in other information disclosure law matters.

ARRB Staff Guidelines for Review of Records Involving Official Cover
Substitute language or a summary will be used for all postponements. The
substitutions will preserve the context and relevance of the information. (E.g.,
"official cover" or "location" or "details of cover arrangements.")
For Congressional documents. Cover information will be released unless the
information explains details of the scope of official cover or important details
about the mechanisms of official cover that is not generally known to the public.
Information shall not be released if the Executive Branch shall be able to
demonstrate that it has taken affirmative action to prevent the disclosure of such
information in the past and that release here would cause Identifiable damage to
national security.
For Executive Branch documents and "derivative" documents. Information
generally will be released except:
4.
a. the substitute language "official cover" will be used for the actual official
cover,
b.
substitute language will be used in lieu of the details of official cover or the-
specific locations of cover facilities;
c.
the cover status of certain high-profile individuals will be released when
disclosure has previously been permitted by affirmative official acts of the
Executive Branch of the US govemment;
d.

way similar to other key issues on a case-by-case basis; and

Θ.
information disclosing that a cover arrangement was not employed shall
be released unless the information reveals or would reasonably imply the
existence of otherwise postponable information.
The Review Board shall continue to retain the final authority to make "formal
determinations" within the meaning of the JFK Act. Although these Guidelines
describe the approach the Board intends to follow, whenever a document
presents an issue that is not resolvable under these guidelines or to the extent
that a document presents a difficult issue under these guidelines, the issue shall
be brought to the Review Board's attention for its formal determination.

Dear Mr. Gunn:
Re: Release or Postponement of "Official Cover" Information
This letter is intended to confirm our understanding of the
recent "review guidelines" promulgated by the Assassination
Records Review Board ("Board" or "ARRB") for public release of
certain information concerning the identity, scope, details, and
specific mechanisms of official cover (hereafter "official cover
details"). This understanding is based on the prefatory
negotiations between our respective staffs and reflects the
agreement of all concerned agencies and departments within the
Executive Branch. Please note that we have included a classified
addendum which presents examples of some of the following
understandings.
1. It is the intent of the staff of the Board and the
federal agencies that these guidelines should serve the public
interest by making the complete story of the JFK assassination
available while protecting from official disclosure information
which would be harmful to the national security and is properly
classified under Executive Order 12958.
2.
Information in documents originated by the Congress
(most often in the context of personal statements to committees
or committee staffs) which sets forth official cover details
shall be presumptively released unless it sets forth specific
information not generally known to the public or the Executive
Branch is able to demonstrate that it has taken affirmative
action to prevent the disclosure of similar or identical
information in another context in the past and that release here
would cause identifiable damage to the national security.
NW 65360 Docld:32404537 Page 12
T. Jeremy Gunn, Esquire
3. Information in documents originated by the Executive
Branch (including those designated by the parties as quasi-
executive branch documents which reflect extracts from the
records of the Executive Branch) which sets forth official cover
details shall be presumptively postponed to the extent that it
concerns:
4.
•
•
•
identity or identification of the official cover
provider,
specific locations used for official cover, and
scope, details and mechanisms of any particular
official cover.
Information in such documents which the Executive Branch
has taken an affirmative act to officially disclose or allow to
be disclosed shall be presumed to be releasable; however, in no
event shall extrinsic evidence by inference or deductive
reasoning be deemed to qualify for this provision.
5. Further, information in such documents which relates to
individuals who are considered important to the story of the
assassination shall, consistent with past practice, be considered
for release on an individual basis with the Executive Branch
having a higher standard of proof of damage to the national
security.
6. For any information postponed pursuant to the review
guidelines, the concerned Executive Branch agency or department
agrees to provide an unclassified summary or substitution which
preserves the general content and relevance of the postponed
information.
NW 65360 Docld:32404537 Page 13

7. It is the intent of the Executive Branch that neither
the review guidelines nor the release of documents pursuant to
these guidelines shall be deemed to constitute an official
Executive Branch acknowledgment of the identity, scope, details,
and specific mechanisms of official cover in other information
disclosure law matters.
8. It is the understanding of the Executive Branch that no
release under the authority of the JFK Act shall be
deemed to constitute official executive acknowledgment in other
information disclosure law matters unrelated to the Act.
Your acknowledgment of receipt and concurrence below would
be greatly appreciated.

Dear Mr. Talbott:
I am writing in response to your December 17, 1997 security-classified letter to
Assassination Records Review Board Chairman John R. Tunheim. Inasmuch as the
Executive Director is the statutorily designated liaison of the Review Board to Federal
agencies, I am taking the liberty of responding to you directly.
Your letter identified State Department interests in several records that are scheduled
for an upcoming Review Board meeting. Although the Review Board is well aware of
the general interest that you describe in your letter, the Board has not received evidence (or
argument) from the State Department regarding the particular records at issue. Even if the
Board were to agree with the general propositions stated in your letter, it is not clear
that the opening of the documents at issue would release any information that is not
already effectively in the public domain.
"
The Review Board strongly urges the Department of State to provide evidence that is
specific to the documents at issue. I would be pleased to make arrangements for your
designated representative to review the specific records so that he or she might provide
evidence that would assist the Review Board in its decisions.
Sincerely
T. Jeremy Sunn

the CIA presence in Warrenton, CIA's involvement in various
non-governmental organizations, and the details of CIA
funding of the Cuban Revolutionary Council--are very
welcome. I must, however, urge the Board to reconsider its
decision to release documents in a form that would reveal

have. Meanwhile, I offer the following summary of our

The first letter just offered 7 days to appeal the decisions to the President. The second says they have not received evidence or
argument from State regarding the particular documents.
I have discussed with Kennedy, who initially felt State was just getting blown off. I have forwarded copies to Lee Strickland and DDA.
My guess would be that the first JFK Board letter was written after receiving Kennedy's letter, but before they got Talbot's. Have put
State's Acting FOIA & Declassification head, Margaret Grafeld, in touch with Lee to discuss next step and response. If anyone knows
ExDir Gunn, would like a reading to pass on to Kennedy.
