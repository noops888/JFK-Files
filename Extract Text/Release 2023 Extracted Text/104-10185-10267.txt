1. The Station is puzzled by the statement of references that
operaticnal reporting on the LITAMII-9 operation has been "consistently
neglected".
2. Using 1 January 1964 as a point of departure, the files of the.
Station reflect the following dispatches transmitting detailed reports

Comnio Plan
3. It is realized that an operational progress report and a contact
report are two different items; however, in view of the detailed nature of
the LITAMIL-S CR'S the Station has felt that their submission has satisfied
the requirements of operational reporting. The criticism of reference s
all the more puzzling since such visitors to the Station as Chester D.
Lainold, Chief, WD, Horton A. Woolley, erstwhile Chief of Operations, MD;
and Thomas W. Lund, present Fexice Branch Chief, have all expressed their
approval of the detailed operational reporting on this speration during
visits they have made to the Station at which time the reports in question
have been brought to the'r attention.
4. When LITAMI-3 next exits PERUME.., the Station will begin to
prepare formal operational progress reports on the operation.
5. As for the questions raised in paragraph 2 of refcrence regarding
operational security, advance information on LITANIL-9's recall came from
LIENVOY but he was not informed of the imminence of his transfer until it
was reported routinely by LIFAMIL-7 and was generally known by his collea-
ques, As for the implication that LITAMIL-9 was informed of the Station's
capability to intercept Embassy telephone conversations, a careful re-
reading of the Memorandur: under critique will show that no such acichow-
ledgement was made, IITAMIL-9 was informed that "we have a good chance
of being told about such a conversation by one of our friends," i.e, that
werd will probably get around in Embassy circles that LITAMIL-9 is about
to travel to such-and- such a point.

As for the speculation that LITAMIL-9 suspects that Embassy phones are
tapped, he has indicated his belief that this is the case ever since he was
taken over by the present C/O. In fact, he is prone to say "I called
so-and-so en such-and-such a matter, using the phone instead of the inter-
oom so you could hear it. In cases wherein he has spoken this way, he has
been told that chances are we will never hear about the matter discussed
unless he reports on it specifically in his meetings with his C/O.

Meetings with LITAMIL-9, 12 February 1965
17 February

26 February
2 March
3 March
8 March
10 March
1. Meetings were held with LITAMIL-9 on the above dates. L-9 brought
his brother to the meeting of 2 March. He failed to show up for a scheduled
meeting on 7 Farch but made the alternate the next day. The large number of
meetings in a relatively short time was due to the imminence of L-9's transfer
from Mexico.
2. The meeting of 12 February concerned furniture of the Embassy end L-9
described a piecs being re-upholsterci as from the office of AMRIFT-1. On the
basis of this report the decision was made to go ahead with another LIRO:ANCE-type
operation.
3. At subsequent meetings L-9 reported as follows:
::
AH I to HONDA 2560
a. On 13. February an outfit named Conciertos Mexico, A.C. asked L-9
to formally invite Cuba to send contestants to the First International
Guitar Contest whcih will be held in Mexico City the first two weeks
of September 1965. An Embassy note was sent out on 15 Feb.
b. on 4 Feb Lic. Vidal LUK Peralta of the Instituto Mexicano del
Seguro Social, Subdirrecion General Administrativa, wrote a letter
to the Cuban Ambassador asking the Enbassy to obtain a copy of a
book entitled Petorna a la Alborada for him. According to LUNA
this book is published in Cuba. LINA's letter read in parts
Como funcionario mexicano, universitario y maestro universitario,
me interesa la obra de referencia, por considerar que dicha obra
constiture el aperte más interesante que ha sido editado en los
ultimos años, dentro del marco de las ideas del enorme Martí.
c. On 13 Feb CUNCA told L-9 that he, CUENCA, expected to remain in
Mexico for a month on TDY. Referring to possible replacements for
APARICIO, CUENCA told L-9, "Whoever it is who comes, it will have
to be someone who doesn't get in your way."
d. On 13 Feb someone came to the Embassy to give L-9 some anti-Castro
propaganda material distributed in Veracruz recently. L-9 took it
to the Ambassador and left it with him. (From the description, this
sounds like LIRCOK material).
e.
On 15 Feb 1-9 went to the Institute to pick up two woodcarvings of
CASTRO and MELLA, the Communist martyr, which someone had donated
to the Institute. They were very poorly done and as L-9 passed
through the Embassy yard with them under his arm, someone in a group
of staffers there, including CUENCA, called out to him apting twist

he intended to do with the carvings. L-9 replied, "The only thing
they're good for is burning." This caused quite a roar of laughter.
According to 1-9 his reply was quite "daring" since one doesn't joke
abcut Fidel in this way. He feels that by making such a remark he
is demonstrating his self confidence to the rest of the staff.
f. On Monday 15 Feb at 1145 hours Lic. MAS Araujo was with the Ambassador.
(LIFOMANCE lead).
g. On 15 Feb Sol ARGUEDAS, who is butting in more and more in affairs of
the Cultural Department; phoned the Embassy to see if she could get a
letter in the pouch to Jose FRESNEDA of the Casa de las Americas.
h. On 15 Feb an Englishman named Robert CUNDY showed up to exhibit some
films he had made in Cuba, These were unedited rushes, CODI said he
hopes to go back to Cuba again soon to make some movies in the Sierra
Maestra arca. The films he showed at the Embassy dealt with such
prosaic subjects as sponge fishing in Cuba. They were shown from
1600 to 2000 hours. Are later to appear on British TV. At one point
Fidel CASTRO appeared on the screen and no-one applauded. Julian
LOPEZ, sitting up front, turned around and accused everyone of being
gusanos.
:
1. Cn 16. Feb the wife of the code clerk, VILLAVICENCIO, was acting as
secretary to the Ambassador. L-9 felt that this was a good example
of the acute shortage of help since this woman apparently has no
ability or experience in the secretarial field.
J. On 16 Feb an American woman named Ana TOMPKTIS visited the Embassy.
Blond, pretty, about 35. She said she is a social worker, was in
Cuba before in 1960. Now lives at Ignacio Mariscal 132, Mexico City.
Wants to go to Cuba again for a visit. L-9 referred her to the
Consulate.
k. On 17 Feb L-9 got a phone call from the secretary (female) to Humberto
ROMERO (in turn, secretary to ALM) who wanted to speak to the Anb.
L-9 referred call to correct number.
1. On 19 Feb L-9 overheard the Amb ask Cuenca, "Are you going to Cuba
today?" Apparently the Amb know nothing of C's change of plan.
m.
On 19 Feb Cuenca told L-9, "I've got to hurry back to Habana but I
will be back here in about 6 wecks."
تره
The courier ENIS arrived on. 19 Feb.
o. The daughter of the CAMACHO couple (night watchman and cleaning woman)
left for Cuba on 19 Feb as a "becada."
p. Luis PRIETO of the MLN came to the Embassy at 1630 hours 19 Feb and
spoke with the Amb and L-9 about the Cultural Institute. They spoke in
the LIROMANCE-1 room. PRIETO had with him a plan Sol ARGUEDAS had
written up about beefing up the Cultural Institute. It was addressed
to the Amb. (LIROMANCE lead),
q. As of 19 Feb a visa still had not arrived for Vicente CHUMACERO (see
previous CR).

dd. At 1223 hours on 23 Feb Joso MANCISIDOR, hijo, visited the
Cultural Department to see about having his father's bock,
A History of the Mexican Revolution, published in Cuba, He said
he is not interested in making money on the new edition.
ee.
During the night of 24 Feb a cable came to the Embassy announcing
that the ship Karl Marx would not be coming to the Mexican coast
to pick up cotton for shipment to Cuba. It was addressed to Guillerm
RUIZ (long since gong). When Avilio GORJON opened it up and read
it he exclaimed "Cabonesi" and stormed off.
ff. On 25 Feb the American Social worker, Ara TOMPKINS, see item j
acove, came back to the Embassy. Her documentation was not
sufficiently complete to qualify her for a visa. She was told
to come back later.
gg. On 25 Feb L-9 accompanied Sol ARGUEDAS (in place of Federico
ALVAREZ, who begged off) to a number of points in the city
picking up artifacts, books, etc., which Sol had arranged to
be given to the Embassy -- to be sent to Cuba for the Casa de
Mexico in Habana. They spent 3 hours on this.
hh. On the night of 25 Feb L-9 got a phone call from a woman who
?
talked as though she had been drinking, said "I am a spy watching
you," and made a lot of foolish remarks. 1-9 thinks it was Sol
ANGUEDAS but rather than play games with her he hung up after
explaining he didn't have time to waste talking to people who
refuse to identify themselves.
11. On 27 Feb L-9 first learned officially that he was to be trans-
ferred when the Amb called him into the office and gave him the
word. L-9 took the news calmly (the C/O had earlier told him
that he would probably be transferred soon). He He told the Amb,
"I am nothing more than a soldier and I will go where crdered."
Curiously enough the Amb seemed to think some pity was in order
and said it was a shame L-2 had to go but that, "that's life
and, wito knows, maybe I'll be transferred out of here before
long myself." The Amb praised L-9 highly for his work and
mentioned specific instances when L-9 had accomplished difficult
tasks for the Embassy by his smooth manner of working with
Mexican officialdom. L-9 said that many of his friends wondered
why he stayed with "that Embassy" but that he felt that as a
patriotic Cuban it was his duty to stick with his fatherland
in lean days as well as better times. He was ready to go when
and where he right be ordered. He told the Ambassador he would
be rady to leave about 8 March as it would take him some time
to settle his affairs. The Amb told him there was no hurry and
he could have as much time as he might need to get things in
order.
11. On 1 Var L-9 brought the Amb over to his department and showed
him his files, library, etc.. Everything was in apple pie order
and the Amb was quite impressed. One thing that struck his fancy
was L-9's system of keping a running log on incoming phone calls
on a calendar set by the phone- the Amb liked this idea so much
he sent someone out to buy him a sirilar calendar-log.

h. At the reception of 4 Jan (Ворофоodatnodnionobonoboomba

en nasse, were extremely cordial in their dealings with him.
At this same reception he again saw LIULEO-1 and made it a poiro
talk with her, ses her to the door when she was ready to leave,
etc. She told him she would like to work in the Fabasay and tha
she had formerly worked as secretary for ANQUACK. The two agreed
that it would be a good idea to get togeiner sometine socially.
(LIOLEO's version coincided exactly with this).
1. After the 4 Jan reception, when all the guests had gone home,
SINOBAS and some of the others started joking about the names of the
Soviets who had attended they would try to pronounce these names
and rears of langhter would ensus. L-9 felt that this was interest-

and expensive to store - he wanted to know whether he could plan
on being in Mexico a while before starting this work. The Aab told
hia he should by all means begin the work as he knew of no plan

with export of blood plasma). Urbieta said he would like to
