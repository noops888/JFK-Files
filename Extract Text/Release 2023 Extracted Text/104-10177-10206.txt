David M. Curry, Esq.
First Assistant U.S. Attorney
Western District of Pennsylvania
633 U.S. Post Office and Courthouse
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219
Dear Mr. Curry:
Re: Joseph Raymond Merola
In response to your letter of March 10, 1977 I wish to advise you
that the Central Intelligence Agency had one meeting with Joseph Raymond
Merola prior to August 1961. In late 1960 Joseph Raymond Merola made
several telephone calls to a CIA office offering his assistance in a general
way in connection with Cuban matters, which was refused. However, on
6 February 1961 Merola claimed to have information on a Latin American
senator who was a "close friend and confidant" of "Che" Guevera. Since
Guevera was listed as being the subject of foreign intelligence requirements,
the CIA employee agreed to meet with Mr. Merola. The meeting took place on
6 February 1961 and is the only meeting with Merola prior to his incarceration
which you stated in your letter began in August 1961.
Mr. Merola was not employed by the Central Intelligence Agency. His
contact with the CIA could not be described as an undercover Government
informant as alleged in the Writs of Error Coram Nobis by Victor Carlucci
and Daniel Hanna. This one contact on 6 February 1961 by Merola with the
CIA was voluntary on his part.
Mathew McVane, an employee of the CIA, did testify in San Diego in
November 1975 concerning CIA contacts with Joseph Raymond Merola. The
citation we have for that case is U.S. v. Dalton C. Smith, et al. in the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, No. 74-2277-GT.
The testimony given in that trial is not inconsistent with the response given
above. It is true that after Merola was released from prison he again
volunteered information to the CIA. Merola was a voluntary source of foreign
intelligence.
I hope this provides sufficient information for you to file your response.
If not, please call me at (AC 703) 351-7531.
Sincerely,

SUBJECT

Joseph R. Merola
REFERENCE
: Assistant United States Attorney
Pennsylvania Letter, 10 March 1977,
Subject as Above
1. The question in reference is the nature of
any involvement of Merola with CIA prior to
August 1961.
2. The Directorate's first recorded contact
with Joseph Raymond Merola prior to August 1961
occurred on 6 February 1961. It followed a series
of telephone calls over a period of several months
(late 1960 early 1961) in which Merola had
expressed interest in offering his assistance in
connection with Cuban matters. Our officer had
declined contact until 6 February when Merola
claimed to have information on a Latin American
senator who was a "close friend and confidante"
of "Che" Guevera. Because Guevera was the proper
subject of foreign positive intelligence collection
requirement our officer agreed to a meeting.
3. The last recorded contact, except for the
litigation outlined below, with Merola was a tele-
phone contact with Merola in late July 1975 when
he volunteered additional foreign positive intel-
ligence.
4. At the end of August 1975, Merola
contacted a staff officer to ask for testimony in
the criminal fraud trial in San Diego, California
(U.S. v. Joseph R. Merola, et al, Southern District
of California, CR 74-2277-GT) which we subsequently..

5. Subject is characterized as a voluntary
occasional source of foreign positive intelligence
who was in sporadic contact with us.
6. We greatly appreciate the Assistant United
States Attorney's concern for the confidentiality
of our information. The information above may be
made available to the AUSA and the court as
appropriate without further restriction.

Inng Greea, attorney for Cartuca
and Hanna, said the prosecutors, His
bert I. Tete.baum and Daniel J. Sap
dor, knew Merris was a government
agent and therefore "perpetrated a
fraud upon the-tmas court."
Teitelbaura and Snyder are now fed

commented about the action fled by
Green, which is still pending. But
oficial Tamatar with their positiza
snd the two judges will, if necessary,
swear they did not now Meroia was a
government agent.
Cuban Connection
"The answer to this whole thing re
volves around Cuba," said this offi-
- cial.
Green, who represents Manrarino's
son-in-law, said he didn't thinis Me
rola's testimony la Chicago had been
particularly "heipfhu!" to the prese
cution. A "imore logical assumption"
is that Meroia was freed from prisea
because of what he could do for the
government in Cuba, he said..
"This guy works anywhere he wants
to," said Green. "The governmer: has
protected him in California, Chicago
and everywhere else. He still has to be
of value to the government."
One thing is certain: Merola is wel
known in the Miami Cuban comm
nity and among those who have been
linked to alleged Castro assassination
attempts..
"Joe was an undercover agent, he
was closely associated with the gov-
crament," Frank Sturgis, of Miami,
told The Bulletin, "He did have an as-
sociation with the CIA."
Sturgis, who gained potcriety as one
of those convicted in the Watergate
burglary, was a ton Castro lieutenant
during the revolution who served as a
double agent for the CIA. He later
worked against Castro in the Day of,
Pigs operation and has admitted plott
ing to kill Castro
"I know Joe was involved with the
revolutionaries," said Sturgis, "I
know he had an association with the
CIA, but because of compart.
mentalization, you don't know what
they're doing."
Tied to Burglar
nations Committee said Merola was
"a good friend" of Fugeria (Rolando)
Merturer, another of those conneted
of the Watergate burglary. Martinez
is suciated with the CIA a the
Bay of Pigs effort and in other sati-
Castro moves.
"Joe's place in Miami Beach was on
the water and it was used by ant-Cas-
tro groups to smegle arms to Cuba,"
this source said. "Martinez was one of
them."
"I can't recall," Martinez said,
when asked by The Bulletin about
using Merula's dock. "Really, I can't
tell you arything about it.
"He was connected with helping
people here in Miam against the dic-
tatorship of Batista. He might have
been in some other branch that I don't
know about."
:-
Altredo Borges, a Miami business
consultant and a Bay of Pigs veteran,
told a Bulletin reporter inquiring
about Merola to "please write me a
letter."
"I don't know who you are." Borges
said. "I cannot talk over the tele:
phone."
One investigator interested in Ne
rola said the matter is "very sensi
tive, records are hard to come by."
"He seems to it everything." this
investigator said. "He's a pilot, he

SUBJECT: Court Appearance on 13 November 19/5, San Diego, California
2010-118
1. On 13 Sovember 1975, Mart MacVane appeared as a witness for the
defense at the Cafted States District Court for the Southern District of
California, 325 West F Street, San Diego, California. The case was the
United States of America V. Dalton C. Saith, et al. MacVane was called
to testify by E. Mac Anos Jr., attorney for defendant Joe Kerola. In
honor of the scarcena PacVane appeared at the court. On 13 November 1975
ac approximately 15:30 hours Sàn Diego tise Macvane was called to the
witness stand...
2. Кас Агos, attorney for defendant Joe Merola began questioning
after MacVane vas sworn in as a witness. Amos asked how long MacVane
had been employed by the CIA? He asked if MacVane knew defendant Merola?
He asked if Mactane were told by Merola about a shipment of surplus
helicopter parts going to the country of El Salvador? He asked MacVane
if Merola had voloteered other information to the Agency? He then asked
if Merola vere ever paid for such information? Amos also tried to establish
the value of surples parts in Latin America compared to the US. This was
objected to by actorney Robert Thaller, prosecutor in the case. The judge
sustained the objection and Macvaze did not have to answer the question.
Amos finished his questioning and Thaller began a short cross examination.
Thaller asked if MacVane ever beard Verola mention stocks? He also asked
if MacVane knew the name of the corporation that Merola represented? He
thenspointed out that even if some stock fraud were occurring, MacVane
would not be writting because Macvane was not an investigator, but rather
a collectos of foreign information. The cross examination then ended.
All questions were answered to the best of MacVane's ability and knowledge.
3. There appeared to be little purpose in the appearance of MacVane
because it was obvious that Macvane knew nothing of any value concerning
the case. Maclane's total time on the witness stand was about 10 minutes.
After complecten of his testiacay MacVane was released.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Joseph Raymond Merola
OGC 75-1073
5 November 1975
1. On. 3 November I talked to Mr. Matt McVane, DCD officer
stationed in Miami, and he said that he had received the subpoena
from E Mac Amos, Jr. to appear as a defense witness in the trial in
San Diego onii November. Mr. McVane agreed to come to Headquarters
on 6 November to discuss the information in the files and Mr. Robert
Starling of DCD agreed to join in the meeting. Mr. McVane told me
that Lt. Colonel Douglas W. Haldane, who had previously been on
detail to the DCD Miami Office, had returned to the Army and was
currently assigned somewhere in Europe and that his address was
Headquarters.. USARSUR, APO New York, New York 09403:
2 2. Since this Office had received a letter from Mr. Amos with a
request for the current address of Colonel Haldane, I called Mr. Amos
on. 4 November and explained to him that Colonel Haldane was no longer
with the Central Intelligence Agency and it was our understanding that
Colonel Haldane was stationed in Europe. Mr. Amos did not want the
current address of Colonel Haidane. He did state, however, that Mr.
McVane would not be needed in San Diego until Wednesday morning.
12 November. As things stood now, Mr. Merola was the tifth defendant
and it would be that length of time betore Mr. McVane's testimony vould
be needed.
3. Mr. McVane told ine that he had been called by Mr. Robert
Thaler of the U.S. Attorney's Office in California. I told Mr. McVane
that I would contact Mr. Thaler. I called Mr. Thaler who is a a member
of the Organized Crime Sutka Force, Department of Justice. Room 2307,
300 North Los Angeles Street, Los Angeles, California 90012. telephone
No. (AC 213) 688-5808. Mr. Thaier was pieased to hear that Mr. McVane
was being made available to testify and explained that he thought Mr.
Amos had aircady prepared a motion to dismiss if Mr. McVane was to be
denied as a witness for the defense. I explained to Mr. Thaler that Mr.
McVane was coming to Headquarters on Thursday, 6 November, and said
that we would call him to discuss the role Mr. McVane played in receiving
information from Mr. Merola.
4. If this case runs parallel to many criminal prosecutions, the
defense may never put Mr. McVane on the stand when he actually shows
up as this may prove detrimental to their defense. However, we should
be prepared for his testimony if, in fact, it does take place.
