In mid-Jung 1965 a loup of officers was said to be looking for
a "way out" (French, "une sortie") for Castro. Although informed
of this project, Castro is taking no action, while following the
affair closely. This group of officers, made up of members of
the 26th of July Movement, is directed by Pedreiren Prieto, a
Cuban Communist Party (PCC) Central Committee member, and by
Humberto Casterrordana, Director of the National Port Service. 1

STATE
In late April 1966 unrest within the FAR was unquestionable, and
military leaders like Juan Almeida Losque, Sergio delwalle
Jimenez, and Pedro Miret, Tho have gained the respect and admira-
tion of the troops, gave the appearance of supporting the régime
more out of loyalty than of conviction. 2. These men are devoted
to their military duties, and they follow the leader or the cause
for which they fought against Batista, without becoming influenced
Communist "ideology Majors Bernabe Ordaz Ducunge and Victor
Bordorachado, who are not Communist Party members, are isolated
from une taloons: Ordaz is preoccupied with his job in the Havana
Psychiatric (formerly Mazorra) Hospital and Bordon has been re
legated to an unimportant post

Paragraph 4 of CS-311/08789-66 from an official Spanish
service identifies dentifies other Army majors who are said to be
continuing gefforts to organize a rebellion; Miret and
Castello were not mentioned in the Spanish. Service report.
Castello is reportedly an intimate friend of Faure clomon
Mediavilla/Minister of Transportation and leader of the
13th of March Revolutionary: Directorate, an organization to
which Castello belonged
cuba
Unlike Miret and del Valle, Almeida is not a PCC Central
Committee member; del Valle is a member of the Political
Bureau and also of the Revolutionary Armed Forces and State
Security Committee of the Central Committee of the PCC.
TDCS-314/02675-66 contains Bordon's comments about unrest...
in the FAR, which, in histopinion, is greater every day bścause
mutual distrust' between officers, noncommissioned officers,
and enlisted men makes any united action impossible. Bordon
is one of numerous, Army officers whose arrest has been re-
ported by refugee sources in the purge which followed the
Cubela trial. CS-311/05970-66 and reports referenced therein
contain spéculation on the reasons behind the purge, includ
ing the possibility that the purge is directed at members
of the 13th of March Revolutionary Directorate
