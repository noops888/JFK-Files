2023 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
SECRET
11 March 1974
MEMORANDUM FOR: Domestic Collection Division
ATTENTION: Hr. Shaun P. Ryan
SUBJECT: Joseph R. MEROLA
REFERENCE: HH 25826, 8 January 1974
1. On 10 January 1974 the WH/2/GS desk received the
referenced memorandum from the Domestic Collection Division
indicating the Miami field office had been in contact with one
Joseph R. MEROLA. MEROLA had just returned from a business
trip to El Salvador; and he reported that a friend of his had
identified a Mr. Gremillion in the Political Section of the
American Embassy in San Salvador as a suspect CIA representative.
Headquarters traces on Joseph R. MEROLA indicated that on several
occasions in the past MEROLA had claimed that he was a CIA
agent. The Chief of Station, the Mr. Gremillion referred to
above, was recently questioned regarding any Embassy contact
with MEROLA while the latter was in San Salvador. The COS
stated that both within the Embassy community and at social
functions MEROLA had frequently referred to his contact with
the CIA, past and present. He also volunteered this infor-
mation to a former Station contact.
2. In light of the above, it would appear that MEROLA
had taken advantage of his agency contacts in an inappropriate
manner to the potential embarrassment of the San Salvador
Station. We would, accordingly, appreciate that this be given
due consideration in your assessment of the advantage of your
continued contact with him.
