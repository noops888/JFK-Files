05.08 1. On 28 April 1960 I spent several hours with an old friend,
Dr. Robert M. Rosler, 10315 Carnegie Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio, who
had been a very good and cooperative source while I was in Cleveland.
05 Dr. Hosler is a close friend and next-door neighbor to Jim Kand] 08.06
of Rand Development Corporation (who needs no introduction). A44019
2. During the course of conversation,
05
Rosler told me that
within the last two-three months, FMJ Webster, the Rand employee
who defected in Moscow, had written several letters to his father
in the US stating that he wanted to come home. His father got in
touch with Rand, who told him to inform his son to go to the US Embassy.
The son replied that he was "not able to..."
3. Being the impetuous type, Rand then decided that he would
get to the bottom of the matter, so he reached for the telephone and,
possibly to the surprise of all hands, was able to reach Webster,
who is currently in Leningrad. Webster did not go into detail but
said that he would be interested in coming back to the US.
TA-971481
4. At the time of Rand's closing out of his secret office in Moscow,
he left his car in that city. Immediately following this telephone
conversation with Webster, Rand told his wife that he was going to
make his "last trip" to the USSR and would bring back his car.
Accompanying him on the trip will be Dan Moore, formerly of OSS, and son-
in-law of Drew Pearson. Moore is a resident of Cleveland and at
one time was affiliated with the Middle East. He was never
contacted by me because of his erratic nature, because of his
marital connections. Moore is a flamboyant type who is willing to
try anything once or twice. The Middle East defense office
in Turkey was referred to as a US intelligence center by the Soviets
several years ago, so they understandably have a record.
Also accompanying
5. It was Rand's intention to go to Moscow with a friend, Grote Bookbinder.
05
the idea
to go to Moscow was to get his favorite car out of the USSR. In the course of this

6. I have just received a letter from Dr. Mosler saying that
Rand, Moore, and Bookbinder will be leaving for the USSR on 4 May
1960. The purpose of this notification is to provide some warning
that an accident may be on its way to happen. You may use it in
any way you see fit, of course protecting our source.
