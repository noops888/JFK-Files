1. Attached for the Station's information and records
is a copy of the LIENVOY Project Amendment request which was
approved on 26 July 1963, raising the LIENVOY approval by
$23,000 for FY 1964, bringing the total approval for the pre-
sent project year to $70,068.
2. There follows a resume of the pertinent correspondence
concerning this Project Amendment, which resulted from problems
surrounding LIENVOY, LICAPER, Orville R. HORSFALL, Douglas J.
PEINGLASS and Arnold F. AREHART.
:
a. The Station was informed in DIR-35426 dated 26
April 1963 that the Station's original request in HDит-
3380 for replacement of the LIENVOY equipment was held
up for budget reasons and until the future of the pro-
posed LICAPER unit under LIMPO could be determined.
b. The LICAPER Project Outline as submitted with
HMMA-21437 was not submitted by Headquarters to the ap-
propriate authorities for approval. Instead, Head-
quarters cabled approval in principle of the proposed
project (see DIR 48559, 20 June 1963), stating that the
LIENVOY Project was being amendod for the new equip-
ment, which would release the old LIENVOY equipment for
LICAPER. (See HMMW-11678.)

c. After the LIENVOY Project was submitted for
amendment, the Station notified Headquarters in MEXI
5412 of 17 July that the wise decision had been made
to delay making an; appigaches to LiFe regarding
LICAPER until after the presidential nominations had
been made and the political future of LICAPER and
LIENVOY could be better evaluated. Headquarters asked
the Station in DIR 55521 on 19 July 1963 whether this
decision to delay LICAPER might not affect the new
LIENVOY equipment and asked the Station whether Head
quarters should withhold the requisitions for the new
LIENVOY equipment until notified by the Station.
effect, Headquarters now is holding the requisitions
forwarded with HMMT-3380 until the Station informs
Headquarters that a new basehouse has been selected,
and that LICAPER can use the old equipment. MEXI 5452
notified Headquarters on 22 July that a separate cable
would be sent answering the questions regarding the
LIENVOY equipment.
In
3. Headquarters will take no action regarding the new
LIENVOY equipment until the Station notifies Headquarters
that everything is ready for the switch in equipment.

SUBJECT
: Request for Amendment of the LIENVOY
Project
The LIENVOY Project is submitted for amendment. It
was last approved on 29 March 1963 for a total of $47,068
for the period 1 February 1963 to 31 January 1964. It is
requested that this Project be amended for an additional
$23,000 for FY 1964 to cover replacement of equipment for
the LIENVOY tap center.
241. Objectives: The LIENVOY Project_covers_a 24
joint telephone tap operation, and an unofficial liai
son relationship between the Station, OIL ELEGANT and 24
the President. This liaison relationship is often 24
utilized by the Ambassador as a non-diplomatic chan-
nel to the President.
2. Agents: This amendment does not change the
agents under this Project.
3. Changes: Since June 1962, the Station has
been considering moving the LIENVOY center for se
curity reasons. As the time for the Mexican Presi-
dential election approaches, it may become more dif-
ficult to conceal the activities and location of the
LIENVOY tap center. The present equipment is large
and difficult to conceal. The last LIENVOY Project
renewal request stated that a move was contemplated
1) because of security reasons since the present base
has been used for almost three years; and 2) to pro-
vide the new center with more mobile equipment, Dur-
ing the approval process, CI Staff commented that it
concurred with the Station's plan to move the inter-
cept center for the reasons stated, as the project
activity was bound to become of interest to various
opposition elements and the Station was well advised
to make necessary changes to provide for and improve
on the security of the operation.
This new equipment will be placed in a new, more
secure basehouse which is yet to be selected, but

and) Willard C. CURTIS and Arnold F. AREHART, (repre-24
senting KUBARK) The workers in the present center
will not know the destination of the rack-mounted
equipment which is presently being used. It will
be crated, and ostensibly flown out of Mexico being
replaced by the new, light-weight equipment.
The old equipment will actually securely be
transferred to the LICAPER tap center, which is being
established by LITEMPO-2) and which will be carried
under the LICAPER Project. Approval has already been
received from Cland FI Staffs for the establishment
of this new semi-liaison tap center under LICAPER
with the old LIZNVOY equipment.
LIENVOY is one of

the most productive telephone tap projects in KUBARK
of both FI and CE type information.
5. Effectiveness: In addition to providing
intelligence through Its tap center, LIENVOY also
provides the Station with an effective channel to 24
the President of Mexico on matters of prime inter-
est to the Ambassador and the Department of State,
as well as on subjects of KUBARK interest.

6. Problems: Presidential elections are to
be held in July 1964. Since this project is con-
ducted in cooperation with the present President 24.08
and his personal advisor) LIELEGANT \the future of
this project, and the equipment involved will de
pend on the person selected as the next President. 24
The COS has stated that the equipment will remain
in KUBARK control through the KUBARK Staff Agent
who runs the control center, thus it would eventu-
ally beldisposed of in KUBARK's interest should
LIELEGANT government relationship slip when the
next President takes over.
