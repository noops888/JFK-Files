C/S Comment: *Requested reactions
to U.S. media reperts that CIA has
made secret payments to past and
present foreign leaders.
1, NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE OF 1 MARCH HAS BLOWN THE LID OFF
THE SITUAT 10N HERE ONCE AGAIN. SPANISH TRANSLATION OF WHAT
APPEARS TO BE FULL ARTICLE HAS TWO QUOTES BY DAVID PHILLIPS TIED
TO "SO UR CES OF INTELLIGENCE" AND "AN OLD OFFICIAL OF THE CIA" IN
SUCH A MANNER THAT ON QUICK REAING IT APPEARS ALL IS ATTRIBUTABLE
TO DAVID PHILLIPS. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE GOVERNMENT OF
D
VE NE ZU EL A DID, NET BURDEN OF THIS SECTION IS THAT WHILE DAVID
PHILLIPS WOULD SWEAR CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ AND LUIS ECHEVERRIA
ALVAREZ NEVER RECEIVED ANY PERSONAL BRIBES, THE USG GAVE THE
GOV AND GOM FUNDS FOR JOINT OPS OF COMMON BENEFIT. THIS DAVID
PHILLIS KNEW BECAUSE HE WAS CIA CHIEF IN BOTH VENEZUELA AND MEXICO.
2. A GOV STA TE MENT, ISSUED BY THE PRESIDENT'S PRESS OFFICE
LAST NIGHT, CATEGORICALLY DENINES THAT THE GOV HAS EVER RECEIVED
AID IN ANY FORM FROM A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT FOR USE IN INTELLIGENC E
OPERATIONS.

CARTER'S LETTER(STATING THAT THE REPORTS HAVE NO BASE) BY USING
TESTIMONY OF AN EX-AGENT OF THE CIA WHO SAYS HE SERVED IN VENEZUELA
WHEN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ WAS MINISTER OF INTERIOR". "FINALLY,

CIA HAS NO CAPABILITY FOR THIS SORT OF THING AND FOR
SOME TIME HAS BEEN UNDER STRICT IN JUNCTION NOT TO TALK TO PRESS.

ES CO VAR SAID WHOLE SUBJECT WAS PAINFUL TO PRESIDENT
THAT IT WOULD
BE USED AGAINST THE AD PARTY BY THE OPPOSITION IN THE FORTHCOM ING
ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN, AND THE GOV WANTED TO LET IT DIE: WAS THERE
NOT SOME WAY THAT THE USG COULD RESTRAIN EX-INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS
AND THE NEW YORK TIMES FROM RE OPENING THE WOUND. THE

PEOPLE FROM THE INTERIOR OF VENEZUELA HAVE ALSO EXPRESSED THEIR
DESIRE TO JOIN IN THIS DEMONSTRATION. (NOTE THAT AREA CHOS EN
FOR DEMONSTRATION IS PROBABLY BY DESIGN, FAR REMOVED FROM EMBASSY

AS MUCH STEAM IN IT AS WHEN CRISIS FIRST DEVEL OP ED. AS IS NOW
WELL-EST ABLISHED CAP IS MOST SENSITIVE BORDERING ON PARANOIC,
HIGHLY VOLATILE, AND MORE THAN A LITTLE POLITICALLY OPPORTUNISTIC.
