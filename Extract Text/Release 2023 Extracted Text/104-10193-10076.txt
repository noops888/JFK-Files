been in charge of the agency's
efforts against Prime Minister
Fidel Castro of Cuba. He was
among 10 agents whose iden-

Senate Select Committee on In-

Notification of Designation as a Participant in
we Organization Retirement and Msau:lity System
Action: As indicated
Ray: Book Dispatch 5096 & OIRS 7586
1. You have been found to be qualified as a participant in the Cryanisa.
tion Retirement and Disability System and have been so designated effective
21 November 1965.
2. Although such designation under present statutes is viewad favorably
by most persons, the regulation governing this retirement system gives the
Individual the right to appeal such a determination if he deems the designa-
tion adverse to his best interests. In order that this technical requirement
may be satisfied, you are hereby notified of your right to appeal. An appeal
with reasons therefore must be received in Headquarters within 60 days of
the date of this dispatch or acceptance of designation will be assumed, Any
questions that you may have in connection with your designation that cannot
be answered by referring to book Dispatch 5096 should be forwarded to tHead.
quarters.
3. We believe that the benefite of the rganization kotirement System
aro superior to the benefits of the Civil service Retiramen: System, how.
ever, there are a few situations in which an employee at the time of retire-
ment may have so many years of service (almost 37) that he would receive a
higher annuity under the Civil Service system, because of this, the pulicy
decision has been made that a participant in the arganisation system who
"would receive a higher annuity under the Civil service system may, not later
than one year prior to his retirement, apply to be removed from cur system
and transferred to the Civil service system. Thus, you should not anticipate
this contingency as a factor in deciding whether you regard your designation
as a participant adverse to your best interests,
