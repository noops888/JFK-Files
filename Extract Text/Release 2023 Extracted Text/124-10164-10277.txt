On 4-15-64 Inspector Malley received a call from J. Lee Rankin
in New York City. It will be noted that on 4-17-64 the Commission
contemplates interrogating functionaries of the Communist Party (CP) in
New York concerning their knowledge of Oswald.
;
Mr. Rankin made reference to the report of Special Agent
Thomas P. Estep dated 12-18-63 at Cincinnati, Ohio. Mr. Rankin noted
that the report referred to a meeting which occurred at Wheeling,
West Virginia, on 12-8-63. Mr. Rankin noted that the report was marked
"Confidential" and he wanted to know if, in talking to CP people, it
would be satisfactory for him to ask questions concerning the details
of the meeting without interfering with any of our operations.
The report in question contains information furnished by
Confidential Informant CI 104-S who advised that Arnold Johnson of
New York City, public relations man for the CP, gave a talk dealing
with the assassination of President Kennedy. The information, while
helpful, does not add anything of particular significance to the Oswald
investigation and is generally self-serving to the CP.

On 4-15-64 SAC Mason advised that at the particular meeting
there were six other CP members present with Mr. Johnson. Three of these
were symbol number informants of the Cincinnati Office. SAC Mason advised
that these particular informants cover an area in West Virginia and
Ohio where there is CP activity and, hence, these informants are valuable
to the coverage of the CP establishment not only by the Cincinnati Office
but by our Cleveland and Pittsburgh Offices. Furthermore, according
to SAC Mason, the particular informant who reported the meeting, CI 104-S,
is the only informant who is qualified to attend the State Board
meetings of the Ohio CP. Mr. Mason noted that if Johnson is questioned
concerning this meeting they will obviously check for a source and this
could uncover one or all of the informants involved thereby seriously
jeopardizing our coverage.

Mr. John McCone, Director of CIA, called and stated he just
wanted to be sure I am satisfied CIA is giving all the help they possibly 718-94
can in connection with the investigation of the situation in Dallas. He said
he knows the importance the President places on this investigation and
stated the President had asked him personally whether CIA is giving the
FBI full support; he said yes but just wanted to be sure.
I assured Mr. McCone we had the very best support we could
possibly expect from CIA. He then stated we could call upon him for
anything and I said we would do that.
Mr. McCone further stated he was delighted the President
called on me to make the report. I indicated the purpose of our report
as well as the areas it is to cover.
Mr. McCone mentioned the fact that CIA has operational
sources in Mexico City and said, if the Bureau wanted to use them, they
should be handled very carefully because they involve high-level people (0)
He stated he and Mr. Papich had discussed this. I assured him that the
FBI understands this
I advised Mr. MoCone that Deputy Attorney General Nicholas
deB. Katzenbach was handling this matter in the Department; that when
the Bureau finishes the report, Mr. Katzenbach will go over it very care-
