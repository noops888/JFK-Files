On Sunday, October 21, 1962, Mr. Arthur J. Shanahan
the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) delivered a lead capsule to the
FBI Laboratory for the purpose of identifying a gray-appearing powder
contained in a well inside the capsule.
Jesons
This capsule was reportedly recovered from a Cuban beach
by an individual who said it was one of many which were being
unloaded from a Soviet submarine. The instant device reportedly
fell from a wheelbarrow being used for transport. (54)
It was reported to the Laboratory that the Atomic,
Biological and Chemical Division of the Office of Special
Investigations had checked the capsule for the presence of radio
active and biological warfare agents with negative results ☑☑☑
Approximately 8 1/2 grams of a mechanical mixture of
ground. glass (55%) and ground sintered iron particles (45%)
constituted the powder inside the well in the lead capsule. Also,
present in the powder were several opaque crystals of potassium
ferrocyanide which appears to be an accidental ingredient as a
result of sintering the iron metal.
(4)
The lead cylinder itself measured 3" high, was 1 9/16"
in diameter and bore a 1/2" diameter hole having 11 1/2 threads per
inch, which is standard domestic pipe thread. (4)
