ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES
REFERENCE: OSM-12616, 5 July 1961
ACTION REQUIRED: For Station and Liaison Information
Headquarters is in receipt of Reference, and wishes to inform the
Station that Subject has been released after 5 months of detention. An
article appearing in The Miami Herald issue of 12 June 1961 states that
the "former Castro rebel leader" arrived in Miami on Sunday, 11 June 1961,
with 11 fellow Cuban exiles. GUTIERREZ stated that he and others had
been freed "on parole" and probably would be permitted to live in the
U.S.A. as political exiles. It is assumed, therefore, that Subject's
activities now will be watched only and there will be no further interviewing.
