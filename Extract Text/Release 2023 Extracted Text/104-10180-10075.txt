Dear Joke,
Cuoa: Anguilla CAY
23
Please refer to our letter [CP/4625] of 12 June.
2. I believe we mentioned to you verbally at the time
of the L.C.A. CAY incident that the police had sent to
S.I.O. C.A a microfilm of most of the documents
recovered by then from RAY's party, including W.T. Coles.
These were all later returned to the party, since the
Magistrate ordered confiscation of firearms only.
3. I attach a copy of the prints from the film
relating to codes and messages, for your retention.
4. [.....] have meanwhile passed those prints relating
to codes to [.....] who will be letting [.....] know if they
contain anything of interest. Copies of these points
will also be made available by [.....] to N.S.A.
29
Yours sincerely, 06
[Jolen L.]
