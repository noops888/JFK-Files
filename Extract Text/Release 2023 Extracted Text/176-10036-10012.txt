CONTEL 113.
Situation as of noon. Tshombe convoked Jean Back and Consuls to
say UN opened fire on women advancing through road block and
alleged one women killed and 13 Wounded. UN officers present
at convocation as much as confirmed Tshombe's statement. Back
agreed put Tehombe on radio with Gardiner as soon as possible.
Should be remembered that according to CAS report, this march
by Femmes Katangaises was planned last night and obviously
coordinated with GOK.
Light firing continues in vicinity of road block.
