1962 Harvey states: "The statement that Operation Mongoose had had no information on

OCCURRENCE:
Meeting of SGA On Operation MONGOOSE, 6 September 1962. Discussion of LANSDALE'S
suggestion #32 (agricultural sabotage). GENERAL CARTER emphasized the extreme
sensitivity of any such operation and the disasterous results that would flow
from something going wrong particularly if there were obvious attribution to
the-U.S. He went on to say, however, that it would be possible to accomplish
this purpose by methods more subtle than those indicated in the paper. He men-
tioned specifically the possibility of producing crop failuresby the introduction
of biological agen's which would appear to be of natural origin. BUNDY said that
he had no worries about any such sabotage which could clearly be made to appear
as a result of local Cuban disaffection or a natural disaster, but that we must
avoid external activities such as release of chemicals, etc. unless they could

OCCURRENCE: When RFK asked Helms for his comments, helms stated that "we were prepared
to get on with the new action program and that we would execute it agressively."
Helms pointed out, however, that the objective of Operation MONGOOSE would have to be
determined at some point since the Cubans with whom we have to work were seeking a
reason for risking their lives in these operations. Helms detailed his conversation
with the young Cuban from the EDRE who pointed out that they were willing to
commit people only on operations which they regarded as sensible. Helms defines.
sensible in Cuban terminology as meaning an action which would contribute to the liberatic
of their country, another way of saying that the United States, perhaps in conjunction
with other Latin American countries, would bail them out militarily. Helms' point
was specially echoed by Huston and Ryan.
