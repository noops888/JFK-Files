THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION. SOURCE GRADINGS ARE DEFINITIVE. APPRAISAL OF CONTENT IS TENTATIVE.
AN AMERICAN OBSERVER (B); FROM NGO DINH NH특.
IT IS PROBABLY TRUE THAT NGO DINH NH특 MADE THE STATEMENTS AS QUOTED, AND THAT HE
WAS AWARE THAT THEY WOULD REACH AMERICAN OFFICIALS: THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN
THE STATEMENTS, HOWEVER, IS APPRAISED AS POSSIBLY TRUE.
1. ON 27 FEBRUARY 1963 NGO DINH NHU SAID THAT HE ANTICIPATED A MAJOR
TURNING POINT IN THE WAR IN VIETNAM FY JULY 1963. HE SAID THAT THE VIETNAMESE
COMMUNISTS (VC) WOULD MAKE A VIGOROUS EFFORT TO BE SUPERIOR TO THE GOVERNMENT
OF VIETNAM (GVN) BY MID-1963, AND THEREFORE COULD BE EXPECTED TO STRIKE IN
INCREASINGLY LARGER FORMATIONS. NHU CLAIMED THAT THE GVN HAD TO UNDERTAKE
STRONG COUNTERMEASURES TO LESSEN THE IMPACT OF THE VC ACTIONS, AND TO DEFINE
MORE CLEARLY THE TREND OF THE WAR IN FAVOR OF THE GVN.
2. NHU ALSO COMMENTED THAT THE NUMBER OF AMERICANS, AND THE SCOPE OF
AMERICAN AID, IN SOUTH VIETNAM SHOULD BE REDUCED. NEU STATED THAT THE NUMBER

OF AMERICANS CONSTITUTED A VC PROPAGANDA ADVANTAGE, BUT WAS INSUFFICIENT TO
OVERCOME THE DISADVANTAGES AND VULNERABILITIES, AND THAT ALL AMERICANS NOT
ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL SHOULD BE WITHDRAWN. NHU FURTHER STATED THAT THE GVN
SHOULD SEEK MEANS OF REDUCING THE REQUIREMENTS FOR AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE,
SINCE SOUTH VIETNAM MUST ACHIEVE AS MUCH SELF-SUFFICIENCY AS POSSIBLE.
3.
NH특 SAID THAT HE HAD NO RESPECT FOR THE CRITICS OF THE REGIME, BOTH
IN SOUTH VIETNAM AND ABROAD, WHO, WHILE PRETENDING TO BE INTERESTED IN THE
WELFARE OF THE COUNTRY, ACTUALLY ONLY WANTED TO ADVANCE THEIR OWN PERSONAL
POWER AND SELF-INTEREST. NHU STATED THAT NEITHER HE, NOR OTHER VIETNAMESE
LEADERS, CONSIDERED THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION, WHICH HE DESCRIBED AS A
TEMPORARY PRODUCT OF HISTORICAL NECESSITY, AN IDEAL SITUATION.
