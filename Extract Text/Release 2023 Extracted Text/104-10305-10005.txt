Ms. Penelope Grenoble, Editor
Los Angeles Free Press
5850 Hollywood Boulevard
Los Angeles, California 90028
Dear Ms. Grenoble:
This letter is in response to the distortions and outright falsities
printed about me in the article written by William W. Turner, titled
BANK ROBBER, MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE LINKED TO JFK ASSASSINATION PROBE,
which appeared in the July 25-31 edition of the Los Angeles Free Press
I request that the Free Press either print a retraction of such lies
and distortions or publish this letter.
Mr. Turner, who spent ten years as a Special Agent of the FBI, is not
unfamiliar to me. He has authored similar articles, both during my
imprisonment in the United States and while I was detained in the
German Democratic Republic, in which he knowingly and purposefully
cited numerous lies about me. He has proved himself adept at putting
words in my mouth and misquoting his sources of information to lend
credence to his major untruths, a skill he probably developed while
serving with the Bureau's intelligence-security division. His recent
claims cause me to wonder whether or not he ever left the FBI.
Professor Richard H. Popkin, from whom Mr. Turner obviously collected
much of his latest baloney, is a character that I feel should either
purchase a hearing aid or consult a psychiatrist. Each of my so-
called discussions with him (all but one occurred over the telephone)
were duly tape-recorded by me, and if he did in fact assert what Mr.
Turner has attributed to him about me, then he too is a liar.
I am listing the following facts in rebuttal to the Turner-Popkin
fable:
The "papers" that I "carried" when arrested did not show me to be a
"decorated hero of the Korean War," nor did they reveal anything
about "a career in Army intelligence." More to the point, the docu-
ments found in my possession and under my control (some of which were
returned to me only last year by the FBI) ensured my incarceration
for a longer period than I had anticipated. They also guaranteed my
being held practically incommunicado for many months (for eleven
months I was not even permitted to read a newspaper), not to mention
the curtailment of my most basic constitutional safeguards.
My contacts with Lee Harvey Oswald did not entail any "friendship,"
nor were they effected for the purpose of establishing rapport.
After my acquittal (in 1968, not in 1967) I did not "drop from sight,"
13-00000
as Mr. Turner, the FBI and the CIA damn weld know.
I have never stated to anybody, either verbally or in writing, that
in 1963 I was an agent for the CIA, although in 1974 I did state,
under oath, that I thought I had been functioning for the CIA during
part of 1963. Mr. Turner is also aware that less than two months
after President Kennedy's death FBI agents confronted me with their
suspicion that I had "acted as an unregistered agent for a foreign
power," inferring that I was a spy for one of the Cuban intelligence
services (several years later the CIA, through one of its "former"
case officers, accused me of having been a Soviet spy: still later,
one FBI agent suggested that I had worked for the Chinese).
The registered letter that was dispatched at my instance to FBI
Director J. Edgar Hoover in September 1963 (not necessarily on the
13th) revealed sufficient details to warrant an immediate investiga-
tion (if not the arrest) of Lee Harvey Oswald and two Cuban refugees.
I certainly "assumed" that some "action" would be taken by the FBI.
I was not the least bit "frantic" about anything in September 1963.
I did not set foot inside the Republic of Cuba during that month.
To my knowledge I have never talked to any "Castro aides." The main
distinction between some American intelligence officers that I knew
and hired killers were the procedures utilized in murdering their
victims and/or the methods used to disassociate themselves and the
U. S. government from their crimes.
I had no fear of being implicated "in the planned assassination" at
the time of my arrest or prior thereto.
The two letters that I mailed to James L. Rankin, General Counsel to
the Warren Commission, were not sent through "private channels." They
were sent through proper jail authority.
I have never claimed that I "squirreled away a snapshot of (myself)
with Lee Harvey Oswald taken in Jackson Square in New Orleans in 1963.
I have never stated that I am "willing to surface and tell (any) story
to Congress" or to anybody. And I did not reveal any details about
Mr. Oswald to Professor Popkin that are "new" or unknown to the FBI.

Bank robber, 'Manchurian Candidate'
linked to JFK assassination probe
ED. NOTE: Recent exposure of
what many consider to be im-
proper CIA activity, both at
home and abroad, has
reawakened interest in decade-
old challenges to official ver-
sions of the assassinations of
John Kennedy, Robert Kennedy
and Martin Luther King. As new
facts also begin to emerge,
Congress faces growing
pressure to reinvestigate the
•JFK assassination.
What follows are the strange
stories, disclosed here for the
first time, of two figures
Richard Case Nagell and Luis
Angel Castillo - long of interest
to assassination researchers.
WILLIAM W. TURNER •
SAN DIEGO, (PNS) On Sept.
20, 1963, a rangy man with a
vertical scar on his forehead
strade into the State National
Bank in El Paso, Tex., and re-
quested $100 in travelers'
checks. Before the teller could
comply, he whipped out a pistol
and fired two shots into the ceil-
ing. Then he waited to be
arrested.
Police quickly realized that
the suspect, Richard Case
Nagell, 32, was no ordinary
bank robber. Papers he carried
showed that he was a decorated
hero of the Korean War who had
gone on to a career in Army
Intelligence before being dis-
charged with the rank of captain
in 1959.
Why had he pulled the non-
robbery?
Last week Dr. Richard H.
Popkin, a philosophy professor
at Washington University in St.
Louis, stepped off a plane in the
nation's capital lugging a brief-
case containing documents il-
luminating the strange case of
the man who shot a bank. Also
crammed into the briefcase was
a thick sheaf of papers relating
to a bizarre "Manchurian Can-
didate" episode in the Philip-
pines in 1967.
Both the El Paso and Manila
incidents, Popkin said in an in-
terview before leaving for
Washington, were linked to the
Dallas assassination of John F.
Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963. They
would "crack the case wide
open," he predicted.
imposter. The FBI knew Oswald
at that time as a defector to
Russia, and, some conspiracy
theorists believe, as a possible
CIA agent.
Popkin said he had been in
touch with Richard Nagell, now
living near San Diego, and had
learned about Nagell's
friendship with Lee Harvey
Oswald. Nagell has fascinated
assassination researchers ever
since an FBI report filed with the
Warren Commission quoted
him as saying he had met with:
Oswald in Mexico City and Tex-
as. But the former intelligence
officer had been inacessible. He
remained in prison for the El
Paso caper until his conviction
was reversed for insufficient
evidence in 1967, after which he

cian was stopping in
Washington to present his dis-dropped from sight.
coveries to Attorney General
Edward Levi and the Senate
Select Committee on
Intelligence Activities before go-
ing on to a conference of learn-
ed philosophers..
The Second Oswald
Popkin is no stranger to the
JFK investigation. In 1966 he
published The Second Oswald,
which chronicled several in-
stances of someone imper-
sonating the man later accused
of slaying the president. At the
time the book gained scant
attention, but recently it was dis-
closed that as early as June 3,
1960, FBI Director J. Edgar
Hoover himself wrote an in-
terdepartmental memorandum
citing evidence of an- Oswald
Nagell's Version
Nevertheless, researchers.
were able to glean some picture
of Nagell's significance from his
defense pleadings and cryptic
letters from prison.
In August 1963 Nagell, work-
ing as a CIA agent, learned of a
domestic plot to assassinate the
president, involving Oswald and
anti-Castro Cubans. He in-
formed his CIA superior but
feared nothing would be done
because he lacked details. On
Sept. 13 he dispatched a letter
warning J. Edgar Hoover of the
plot but again assumed no ac-
tion would be taken.
As Nagell understood, it,

"Manchurian Candidate"
Washington about Sept. 26 (as
it turned out, JFK left Sept. 25provided protective conditions
for a whirlwind tour of the West).
Frantic, Nagell flew to Havana
on Sept. 19 to see if Castro
aides could shed light on the
assassination plot, but the only
advice they could offer was to
execute Oswald in the hope that
would stop the plan.
But Nageil left Cuba deciding
that he "was an intelligence
agent, not a killer." Flying to El
Paso via Mexico City, he walked
into the bank the next day for
"the sole purpose of having
myself arrested and detained by
federal authorities" ap-
parently fearing that his
association with Oswald would
implicate himself in the planned.
assassination.
Nagell was in the El Paso Jail
when Kennedy was shot In
• Dallas two months later. He sent
an offer to testify before the
Warren Commission through
"private channels" but received
no reply.
Dedicated Leftist
In his recent discussions with
Popkin, Nagell has revealed
new details about Oswald. He
first met Oswald, he said, in the
late fifties at the U.S. naval base
at Atsugi, Japan, where Oswald
was a Marine Corps radar
specialist. They became friends
but didn't encounter one
another again until August 1963
when Nagell learned of the plot
against Kennedy.
Disputing claims that Oswald
had ties with the CIA, Nagell
belleves that Oswald was a
dedicated leftist who was duped
by anti-Castro exiles involved in
the conspiracy. Posing as
Castro G-2 intelligence agents,
the exiles wheedled Oswald into
becoming a "fall guy" by playing
on his Castro sympathies, pain-
ting Kennedy as anti-Castro and
promising that he would be
spirited to Havana after the
assassination.
Nagell told Popkin he met
with Oswald both in Mexico City
and New Orleans, hotbeds of
the anti-Castro movement.
"Nagell claims he has squirrel-
ed away a snapshot of himself
with Lee Harvey Oswald taken
in Jackson Square in New
Orleans in 1963," Popkin as-
serted. "In the picture are two
other men, both anti-Castro
Cubans, who were pretending
Popkin is also convinced that
the Manila "Manchurian Can-
didate" case was connected to
the JFK assassination. On
March 2, 1967, a man named
Luis Angel Castillo was detain-
ed by the Philippine National
Bureau of Investigation after he
had contacted left-wing. Huk
guerrillas. Questioned under
truth serum and hypnosis,
Castillo blurted out a tale of hav-
ing been taken to a building in
Dallas, Tex., the day Kennedy
was shot, handed a rifle
assembled from components
hidden in a bowling bag and in-
structed to fire at a man in an
open car sitting next to a lady.
The signal to fire would be given
by mirror flashes.
The story caused a brief sen-
sation at the time. The Manila
Times bannered: "'JFK Plotter'
In Manila!" Wire service dis-
patches to the United States
said Castillo was a "Cuban-
trained Communist agent" who
hadn't shot because he heard
that a man named Joe "had :
already shot the man in the
open car." The story was so im-
plausible that it quickly died.
Not long ago the hypnotist
who conducted the interroga-
tion of Castillo for the Philippine
authorities arrived in this coun-
try under the name Vincente R.
Sanchez. When Popkin took a
look at his reports, his eyes
popped.
The reports termed Castillo a
"zombie"
a hyp-
noprogrammed robot.
-
Double-Agent Network
Sanchez extracted Castillo's
rambling story over a period of
weeks. Castillo, then 28, was in-
ducted around 1960 into a
"Special Operations Group"
which afforded him paramilitary
training. In 1961 he participated
in the Bay of Pigs invasion, as a
pilot for the CIA. Thereafter he
infiltrated a double-agent
network, posing as a Com--
munist in Venezuela and li-
quidating a Communist agent in
Mexico.
In talking about the JFK
assassination, Castillo -'
despite some disjointed
phrases
was nevertheless
able to describe in some detail
-
wait of agent
ordered, "They got him already.
Let's get out of here." After the
rifle was disassembled and
stuffed in the bowling bag, he
was hustled into the car which
had brought him to the building.
It stopped twice within blocks to
pick up other men.
In 1967, according to
Sanchez. Castillo was
programmed to assassinate
Philippine President Ferdinand
Marcos after openly associating
with the leftist Huks - which
would implicate them in the
assassination. Popkin points
out that this is a similar ploy to
the one Nagell attributed to the
anti-Castro Cubans' use of
Oswald."
Until recently, the Castilla
episode might have seemed a
logcial impossibility. But the
release of the Rockefeller
Report, with its revelations
about secret CIA projects to in-
duce behavior modification in
unsuspecting subjects, make
the possibility of a "Manchurian
Candidate" more than mere
fantasy. (In the Robert Kennedy
assassination, Dr. Bernard Dia-
mond, who examined Sirhan
Sirhan for the defense, testified
that he believed Sirhan was
hypnotized at the time of the
shooting.)
Although the current
whereabouts of Castillo is un-
known, the Sanchez reports
contain the names of six per-
sons who supposedly ran his
network, including the "control
officer" and a woman who hyp-
notized him. Popkin's own in-
vestigations have shown that
these people do exist.
Through Popkin their stories
have now been passed on to the
Attorney General and the
Church Committee.

The Cuba Project, the story of
the CIA's secret war against
Castro, will be published this fall
by Houghton Mifflin.

SUBJECT: NAGELL, Richard Case
SECRET
C
18 January 1968
ALLEGATION:
Richard Case NAGELL, "a
highly decorated infantry
Captain in the Korean War",
alleges that he became a
CIA agent. He said he
fired the gun in the bank at
El Paso, Texas because he
wanted to be in custody when
the assassination of
President KENNEDY took
place. NAGELL charged
that "the FBI illegally
seized from him evidence
crucial to his defense,
such as notebooks containing
the names of certain CIA
employees, photographs, two
Mexican tourist cards (one
in the name of Joseph KRAMER,
the other in the name of
Albert HIDEL) and receipts for
registered mail, including the one
for the letter sent HOOVER
warning of the assassination.
NAGELL daimed he was in-
structed to "arrow" the
patsy, that is kill him
(OSWALD) after the assassi-
nation. He contended he
got cold feet and this was
his reason for the attempted
bank robbery, he would rather
be arrested than commit
murder and treason. The
article alleges that while it
was suggested in court that
an airplane crash NAGELL
survived mentally affected him,
he was given intelligence
training after the crash.
Also, NAGELL complains he has
been salted away because of
what he knows.
CIA CONNECTION:
None; although, Subject was of
interest to OS in 1964 and early
1965 because of information
furnished to the Agency by the
FBI that he had in his possession
the names of six CIA employees
at the time of his arrest for bank
robbery at El Paso, Texas on 20
September 1963.

1968 RAMPARTS
Article by William
W. TURNER
OS INDICES RESULTS:
Subject became of interest to the Office of Security in March 1964
when the FBI informed the Agency that Subject had in his possession at
the time of his arest for bank robbery at El Paso, Texas on 20 September
1963 the name of Richard FECTEAU (an individual by this name was captured
by the Chinese Communists and is now in prison in China) and of six Agency
employees. Research failed to reveal any reason why NAGELL had these
names in his possession. It was concluded that while NAGELL is unquestionably
unbalanced, his story of being involved in espionage is not fully contradicted
by evidence. He could have been contacted by a Soviet agent while in Washington,
D. C. in December 1962 or while he was in Mexico City in September and October
1962. His file contains mostly FBI reports dated 1962 and 1964 and in these
are documented his history of mental instability and physical complaints
stemming from the plam crash. Attached is a chronology dated 3 March 1965
made from the information contained in the FBI reports. At the time this
security research was conducted, it was recommended that NAGELL be personally
interviewed by a representative of OS in the hope that NAGELL might reveal
how he came into the possession/ these names but no further action is indicated
in his file and this interview was not undertaken.
DETAILS:
Subject's file reflects no Agency interest in him prior to March 1964
when the names of CIA employees were found in his possession when arrested
for bank robbery.
The RAMPARTS claim that he received intelligence training after the plane
crash is true. The crash occurred 28 November 1954 and he graduated from
Army Intelligence School, Ft. Holabird, Maryland on 15 August 1955. Не
served in Korea and Japan as a member of the U. S. Army Counterintelligence
Corps, terminating about 1958. A Lt. Col. Ned W. GLENN who served with
NAGELL personally in Korea advised that NAGELL was not stable mentally and
that this instability was probably due to brain damage suffered in the airplane
crash.
The RAMPARTS article's claim that NAGELL said he fired the gun in the
bank at El Paso, Texas because he wanted to be in custody when the assassination
took place is not completely in conflict with a statement NAGELL made on
1 January 1964 which was, however, after the assassination. (see page 4 of
chronology)
The RAMPARTS article's allegation that the FBI took from NAGELL a note-
book containing the names of CIA employees is true.

NAGELL's complaint that he was "salted away" is open to speculation. A
ten year prison sentence does appear harsh, considering the documented brain
