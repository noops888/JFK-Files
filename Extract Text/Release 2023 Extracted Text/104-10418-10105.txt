Vladimir KUZNETSOV is Vladimir Nikolayevich KUZNETSOV
who arrived in Brussels in early October 1976 as First Secretary
in the Soviet Embassy. Served as cultural attache and first
secretary in The Hague July 1971 - early September 1974.

He re-
While Cultural Attache KUZNETSOV is not an identified KGB officer,
he is certainly suspect either as an I.O. or a co-optee.
placed a KGB co-optee and is frequently observed in the company of
known KGB officers. It goes without saying that his position affords
him numerous opportunities to make contacts of all sorts.

We do not believe the evidence cited by the (Station (The Hague))
in paragraph two of Reference is strong enough to consider Cultural
Attache KUZNETSOV a suspect intelligence officer or cooptee. KUZ -
NETSOV's replacing a Soviet who was suspected of being a KGB cooptee
does not make KUZNETSOV himself suspect, and although he has been
frequently observed in the Netherlands with known KGB officers, we
note that Reference cites two instances of association with the pre-
sumed GRU Resident, I. O. ANISIMOV. In short, we believe it prema-
ture to attempt to draw any conclusions at all about KUZNETSOV's in-
telligence status, and concur with (SYMPATHIZER'S not including him in
the preseumed KCB Residency.
