This memorandum is for your information only.C-71563
2. The Chief of Station Mexico has advised that a
group, representing the American Chamber of Commerce in C-100386
Mexico City, will be in Washington 30 April through
4 May to attend the 1966 National Conference of the U.S..
Chamber of Commerce. The Chief of Station Mexico has
requested that Headquarters representatives neet and
brief the delegation concerning recent developments
within the communist movements in Latin America and, of
more specific interest, present Soviet, ChiCom and
Satellite objectives and activities in Mexico.
3. A similar group was briefed by Mr. FitzGerald,
then Chief, WH Division, and W.J. Kaufman Chief, WII/1,
on 22 April 1965. This year, because of my scheduled
absence on a trip to Latin America, it is proposed that
Mr. Esterline, Deputy Chief of WH Division and
Mr. Kaufman, Chief Mexico Branch, WH Division will meet
and brief them on the morning of 3 May. The delegation
will be met at the main entrance and escorted to 1 D 0415
for the briefing which should not take more than one hour
and a half. It is not planned at present to take any
member of this delegation to any other office in the
Eeadquarters building and there has been no request for
meetings with the Director of Central Intelligence or
his immediate staff.
4. Mr. Paul Kittredge of the Mexico Branch, WH
Division, will be the Control Officer for this visit and
may be contacted for any additional information required
on x4523/4524 or Red 9322.
20 April 1906: Note for Reand: After discussions the this proposal with C/01/01,
