1.
Reference (c) authorized a loan of $12,000.00 to
LIMOUSINE for the construction of an apartment building. Repayment
of this loan, per agreement forwarded to Headquarters by reference
(b), was to have been partially made by renting the top-floor
apartment of his building to any person designated by the Station
rent-free at a calculated value of $184.00 per month. Subsequently,
it was orally agreed that we would credit his indebtedness with
$240.00 per month, since the latter amount is the actual rental
fee..
2. Also, as part of reference (b) agreement (paragraph 6),
LIMOUSINE was to have refunded all rents paid him by the lessee
for occupancy of the LILYRIC top-floor apartment for the first
twenty-four months. WOFIRM paid LIMOUSINE $5,760.00 for rental
of the subject apartment during this period, of which he refunded
$720.00 in May 1966, leaving a balance of $5,040.00.
3. As indicated by recent SGDIAL audit findings, LIMOUSINE
is indebted to WOFIRM as of 31 December 1968 as follows:
a.
$384.00 per paragraph 4 of reference (b) agreement.
b. $5,040.00 for rents received from WOFIRM, per
paragraph 2 above.

1. To final sale of LitoUSINE's property described in
paragraph 1 of Ref A has been delayed by the necessity for the
insurance companies to obtain approval of various plans (sewage,
streets, electricity, etc.) from the the appropriate COM agencies
prior to signing a sales contract. These requirements are
stipulated by the agency which regulates the financial activities
of insurance companies. All of these bureaucratic requirements
have been met and LIMOUSINE expects th the sale to become finalin
December 1968. Но е - 1968. Но ехpects to realise substantial cash from the
sale in February or March 1968. In the meantime LIMOUS LIMOUSINE
continues to find himself strapped for cash becauso be has the
continuing expense expense of holding the land over a much longer period
than he had planned. His personal finances are also tight quo que to
two complicated operations with longhty hospital stays which his
wife underwent in 1968. For all of the above reasons LIMOUSINE
requests an extension on his loan to FOFIRM until 31 March 1969.

3. The undersigned has been in close touch with LIMOUSINE
on his financial problems and can certify that he is temporarily
in financial straits because he unexpectedly held a piece o
land for almost two more years than he anticipated and that the
final sale 18 close to completion. This is a major tract of
land in which LIMOUSINE will realise a personal profit of almost
one million dollars. The magnitude of this profit is the reason
that LIMOUSINE has been holding the land tenaciously and going
into the hole in the process.
4. For the above reasons and the reasons given in paragraph
8 of REF A, the Station strongly recommends that LIMOUSINE's loan
in the amount of $8,706.67 (US/CY) be extended to 31 March 1969.

LIMOUSINE LIMESA LILYRIC - Request for a Loan to LIMOUSINE
ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES
1. The ownership and bookkeeping of both the LIMESA and
LILYRIC properties is carried in the name of a real estate company
which LIMOUSINE controls. This company owns several other prop-
erties including a major tract of land on the outskirts of Mexico
City which LIMOUSINE has been holding for resale at a profit.
However, his expenses on this property have been beavy over the
past year which has left his company in a very short cash position.
LIMOUSINE delayed selling this tract pending completion of a high-
way which gives access to the property and increases its value.
This highway is now complete and LIMOUSINE is working out the
details of the sale of this property to a consortium of insurance
companies which will construct a housing development. LIMOUSINE
expects to start realizing substantial cash on this sale during
the third quarter of 1968,
2. Due to the short cash position of his company LIMOUSINE
has asked the Station for a moratorium on the money due to the
Station from the LIMESA and LILYRIC properties for calendar year
1967 and the first half of 1968. LIMOUSINE's indebtedness to the
Station for calendar year 1967 is as follows:
a. LIMESA - LIMOUSINE has turned in an accounting on his
expenses for the LIMESA property which he has paid. After de-
ducting his expenses (water, taxes, etc.) he owes the Station
22,332.61 MN.

D. LILYRIC - As detailed in HMMA-25310, 3 February 1965,
LIMOUSINE is repaying his construction loan from the Station on
the LILYRIC property by repaying to the Station the rent on the
LILYRIC apartment which is 3,000 EN per month or 36,000 MN per
year. Of his original loan of 150,000 MN he had repaid 98,790 MN
by 31 December 1966 leaving a balance 51,210 MN. According to the
repayment schedule he should have paid 36,000 MN during 1967
leaving a balance of 15,210 M. Also, according to the schedule,
the loan should be fully repaid by June 1968.
3. Thus, LIMOUSINE's indebtedness to the Station for calendar
year 1967 18 58,532,61 MN (22,332,61 for LIMESA and 36,000 MN for
LILYRIC). By 30 June 1968 his indebtedness will be increased by
approximately 28,210 MN (approximately 13,000 MN for LINESA and
15,210M for LILYRIC. LIMOUSINE's estimated total debt to the
Station by 30 June 1968 is estimated at 86,542.61 MN (58,332.61
MN for calendar year 1967 and 28,210 MN for the first six months
of 1968). 86,542.61 MN equals $6,923,11 (US/CY).
4. Therefore LIMOUSINE requests a loan of 58,332 MN, the
amount already due to the Station for calendar year 1967 and a
second loan of approximately 28,210 MN which represents the money
which will be due on 30 June 1968 (LIMOUSINE accounts on a semi-
annual basis). He has promised to repay all monies due to the
Station during the third quarter of 1968.
5. The Station strongly recommends approval of this loan
for the following reasons:
a. LIMOUSINE has been a faithful Station asset for many
years. Fe has never refused a request of the Station's and has
offered his services continuously without renumeration (the Station
does give him Christmas gifts). He has always been honest in his
financial dealings with the Station and we have no reason to believe
that he will default on this debt.
b. Due to unexpected construction and repair costs on
the LILYRIC building and a poor rental performance (this latter
is partially due to the Station which has vetoed several potential
tengants on security grounds), the LILYRIC building is in the
red. LIMOUSINE doesn't expect it to be in the black for at least
two more years. Since the Station has turned down several tenants,
it is partially responsible for this problem.
6. Please advise.
