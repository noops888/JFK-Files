(Project JMARC)

1. (Rod Newlund, Security Officer with WH Division, stated
the subject had been brought to Washington by WH people for con-
sultations and the subject had informed them that he had been
instructed to report to the District Director of Immigration and
Naturalization at New York when he went there from Miami, but
that he had not had an opportunity to do so before coming to
Washington. Subject stated he had left a note on his door at
home, or in the hotel, that he had come to Washington at the
request of the State Department. Apparently, the I&NS had
called the State Department at Washington and State had contacted
the WH Division to find out just what was happening. Mr. Newlund 03
asked that I have I&NS, Washington, inform New York that the sub-.
ject was here at the request of this Organization, and he would
be back in New York to report to Immigration and Naturalization
in about ten days.
2. Mr. McCarthy, I&NS, stated he would so inform New York.
