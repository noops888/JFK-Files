SUBJECT
: James Garrison
Indep
-
1. Per our conversation in the environs of the DD/P's
office on 19 December, we have just received from [London] Sta-
tion ascrap of information on Subject's activities. [MI-5, 24
the British Security Service, has provided the following in
a report on Americans who are in correspondence with the
Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation:
"Jim Garrison, District Attorney, Orleans,
Louisiana
A secret and reliable source has reported that the
Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation has been in touch
with Jim Garrison. Our source states that the ini-
tiative in this contact appears to have come from
the Foundation and the purpose of it seems to be to
persuade Garrison to write an article about the
late President Kennedy's assassination which pre-
sumably the Foundation could use in some way."
24
2. [MI-5 has also passed this information to the Legal
24 Attache (FBI representative) in [London. I would stress that
[MI-5's source is very sensitive and request that this office
be advised in advance if any executive action is to be taken
on the basis of the above information.
