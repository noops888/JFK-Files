BOTH RODRIGUEZ AND GELABERT IN GENERAL FIT PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
PROVIDED FOR "QUESADA", BUT NEITHER HAS ANY SCARS. BASED ON
ALL HYSAGE-1 INFO ON "QUESADA", RODRIGUEZ SEEMS MORE LIKELY

TO BE IDENTIFIABLE. THIS ASSUMPTION BASED PRIMARILY ON HIS
1964 ACTIVITIES MEXICO LATEST INFO ON RODRIGUEZ IS THAT HE
TRAVELED TO CHILE 4 JUN 71 FOR UNDP MEETING AS REPRESENTATIVE
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS DIRECTORATE, MINREX. RETURNED, CUBA
ABOUT 16 JUN 71
4. IF WH/MIAMI HAS NO OBJECTION, HQS WILL QUERY AMBEDEW-

QUERY AMMUG-1, WHO SERVED MEXICO 1964.
