MFR dtd 3 Oct 77, same subject
I received a telephone call 3 November 1977 from Mr. John
Crowell, Assistant General Counsel for Rockwell International,
Dallas, Texas. Mr. Crowell confirmed that an out-of-court
settlement had been reached by Rockwell with General Thomas Wood
(Ret.), a former employee who had represented Collins Radio
International. Mr. Crowell stated that no court action would
result regarding Gen. Wood's separation from Rockwell and
requested the appropriate Agency official be so notified.
Furthermore, Mr. Crowell indicated it was his understanding
that Mr. Sabani had returned to Iran. Mr. Sabani who possesses
dual citizenship (U.S./Iran) was a former assistant to the General.
No contact has been made by Mr. Sabani with Rockwell to date.
Per Mr. Crowell's request, I am providing a copy of this memo-
randum to the Director, OSO, DDS&T.
