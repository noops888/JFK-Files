MEMORANDUM FOR
The Director of Central Intelligence
SUBJECT: Coordination of the United States

Our Government is making a substantial effort and is expending large
sums of money to obtain timely intelligence vital to our national de-
fense and security. This effort requires the most efficient possible or-
ganization of the activities of the various departments and agencies
concerned. It is essential that these activities be conducted as an
Integrated endeavor best suited to meet both current and longer-term
national intelligence needs. One of the essential objectives of this in-
tegrated effort is to give timely notice to me and to other officials of
critical developments which have an important bearing on our na-
tional security.
In view of the urgent necessity for maintaining effective coordination
of all U.S. foreign intelligence functions, I request that you serve as
the Government's chief intelligence officer, and that you pursue as a
primary responsibility the fask of coordinating and guiding the total
U.S. foreign intelligence effort in accordance with National Security

having foreign intelligence responsibilities, with a view to assuring
the proper coordination, correlation, evaluation and prompt dissem-
ination of intelligence obtained from all sources. You are authorized
and directed to establish, in consultation with member agencies of
the intelligence community, such arrangements and guide lines as are
necessary for this purpose. It is my wish that you receive from the
departments and/agencies concerned the full cooperation and assist-
ance which are essential to the success of your coordinating responsi-
bility.
I will continue to look to your efforts as a means of achieving signifi-
cant improvements in the organization, management, and effective-
ness of our over-all foreign intelligence system.
