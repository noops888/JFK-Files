that Hrs. Lilian SLOBODA, wife of Vladimir 0. SLOBODA, Specialist
5th Class, who defected to the Soviets in August 1960, has
returned to London and she intends to live with her mother
Mrs. SUTCLIFFE in Halifax, England. Mrs. SLOBODA is travelling
with her daughter, age three, and her other two children are

whether she has left Russian permanently or whether she is in
England on a temporary visit.

she settles down and has requested any questions which the
U.S. may wish to put to her. The local FBI representative in
England has been advised of the above.
