MEETING.
HE SUBSEQUENTLY REPORTED THAT HE HAD DESTROYED ALL COPIES
OF CONTACT REPORTS AND ACCOUNTINGS AND WOULD NOT KEEP ANY IN
FUTURE. HE SHOULD, THEREFORE, HAVE HAD ON PREMISES ONLY (A)
STERILE LIST OF NPS CULTIVATION TARGETS, (B) CURRENT ACCOUNTING
DUE FOR SUBMISSION 23 SEPTEMBER AND, (C) POSSIBLY ONE OR TWO
CONTACT REPORTS OF SOCIAL CULTIVATION OF NPS OFFICERS. 24 THESE
MATERIALS SHOULD BE INNOCUOUS IN APPEARANCE AND LIKELY TO BE
MISTAKEN FOR MATERIALS DEALING WITH HOSPITALITY OR BUSINESS
ACTIVITIES. OF COURSE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HE RETAINED MORE THAN
HE SAID, BUT OTHER MATERIALS HE WOULD HAVE WOULD BE MORE OF
THE SAME. FROM C/88'S REMARKS ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, HIS FAMILY
WOULD BE FAVORABLY DISPOSED TOWARD RTACTION OR NVCANOPY. BELIEVE
THEY WOULD BE AGREEABLE TO REQUEST TO EXAMINE HIS PAPERS AND
RETRIEVE ANY DEALING WITH OFFICIAL BUSINESS. CONSULTING LOCAL
RTACTION SECURITY OFFICER REGARDING BEST COURSE OF ACTION.
WILL ADVISE.
