Your ?'s re: Overall Digraph and ZR

An overall digraph is used to designate an overall cryptonym for general subjects, programs,
or activities for which responsibility is shared with other components.
An extract is used when an individual/company in a document has a 201/301 file, but the
length of the document may be too long to 'B' code (B code: to cross-file an entire copy of a
document into a 201/301).
ZR is used to indicate that the pertinent information indicated by the analyst is to be
extracted for headquarters only.
FR is used to indicate that the pertinent information indicated by the analyst is to be
extracted for headquarters and the field.
When an extract is performed, a machine printout is generated and is sent to the location of
the 201/301 file. The printout will indicate:
that it is an extract
what document it is from
the date of the document
where the Record Copy is filed
the information extracted by the analyst.
For example, say there is a 60 page document on the Communist Party of Mexico. The only
time in the whole document the following info is mentioned is: "Juan Jose Gonzalez Jimenez
resigned as Mexico City Chairman on 17 Jan 96." He has 201-0000001. The DMB analyst pulls
this info using 'ZR' or 'FR', and instead of having a 60 page document in his 201, he has a one
page extract.
Hope this helps. Any questions/problems, pls let me know.
