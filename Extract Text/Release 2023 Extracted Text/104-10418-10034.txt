Qutch Security Service reported that "OLTMANS, who previously produced
a commentary on the murder of KENNEDY is still working on this matter
in cooperation with Jim GARRISON. He claims to know who the KENNEDY
murderer was. In connection with thsi OLTMANS has been the guest of
an "oil millionaire" in Texas. According to OLTMANS he was invited there
because of 'his knowledge of the affair' and the fact that he would be
able to act as a medium to bring the facts to the world. At his request
Jim GARRISON has provided him with a body guard while working on this
matter. In Texas it appeared to him that the group who had financed
KENNEDY's murder had had a deep seated quarrel and had fallen into two
groups. Some details regarding this affair have come to light and it is
seriously being considered to bring them to the public via a TV broadcast.
OLTMANS is going to dicuss this with NTS and bring it about.

22 February 1968
OLTMANS interview of Jim GARRISON broadcast on NTS. It is not known
whether GARRISON travelled to The Hague or whether the show was taped
in the United States and sent on tape to Holland. The latter seems
probable, especially since the press did not report travel outside the
United States by GARRISON.
GARRISON calm and composed, was sufficiently credi-
ble to elicit rather favorable reviews from generally well-informed Dutch
newspapers. Several Dutch viewers also commenetd on the credibility of
his person and presnetation. It is likely that the NTS will try to sell
this program to other European countries.
GARRISON repeated well-known thesis that KENNEDY was the victim of
"President Kennedy was killed by elements of the Central
infefience Agency fof the United States Government."

1. On 10 December 1971, it was reported by a (Dutch
Security Service) that William Leonard OLTMANS (who has been the subject
of previous CIA and FBI reporting) was attempting to obtain in the near
future, State Department classified documents via an American contact,
FNU JONES. Said documents concern conversations between John Foster DULLES
former Dutch Foreign Minister Josef LUNS, and former Dutch Ambassador to
the United States, J. H. van ROIJEN, on the topic of New Guinea and Ino-
Indonesia.
2.
According to source, OLTMANS is currently attem-
pting to embarrass and discredit LUNS. OLTMANS already has inls inspired
a recent anti-LUNS article entitled "Has LUNS Mis-Led Us", written by one
Joris van der BERGIN and printed in a sensationalist Dutch newspaper
Vrij Nederland. Source speculates that fnu JONES mentioned above, may
be former US Ambassador -o Indonesia, Howard JONES, as source has estab-
lished that OTLMANS and Howard JONES met during September 1971, in Boston.
Given his bakkground of being a leftist- Anti-American journalist, should
OLTMANS obtain the above mentioned classified material, source feels
OLTMANS would use it to publicly embarrass all parties concerned.

LUNS in his current role as NATO Secertary General because LUNS opposes
Soviet desires for early convocations European Security Conference.
