Cuban Cultural Counselor in Vienna Defects to Spain
Aldo MENENDEZ Paret, Cultural Counselor of the Cuban Legation in
Vienna, who defected to Spain, visited the Embassy July 17 and was
received by Mr. E. J. WILLIAMSON and the reporting officer. Through
CAS channels, the Embassy had already received a report on a Spanish
police interrogation of Menendez, held a few days earlier.
Menendez related that he had held his job in Vienna since November
1961 and that he had left on account of ideological incompatibility with
the Castro regime. He gave as the reason for his late defection, the fact
that he was trying to convince his wife to accompany him; she refused and,
as far as he knows, is still in Vienna and will return to Cuba.
According to Menendez, there remain three officers in the Cuban
Legation in Vienna, all of them thoroughly convinced communists.
Charge d'Affaires Amado PALENQUE, a Communist theorist, was sent from
Havana to replace Fernando GAINZA, who also defected to Spain (See.....
Airgram A-520)ARP Mrs. Palenque is also accredited to the Austrian Govern
ment, and has the title of Third Secretary. The third officer is Roberto
BEHAR, First Secretary of Legation, a forceful man of little education.
Menendez considers Mrs. Palenque very clever and thinks she really runs
the office. Described as security-conscious, Mrs. Palenque has the keys
to the safe, handles all classified correspondence, and is not above
listening in on telephone conversations made through the Legation switch-
board. She is in charge of the two-key safe.
The only other Cuban Government employee residing in Vienna is Luis
:
Orlando RODRIGUEZ, Cuban Ambassador to the Atomic Energy Commission.
Menendez, interestingly enough, described Rodriguez in terms similar to

those used by GAINZA during his interview with Embassy officers. Both of them
thought that Rodriguez was a decent-fellow and an anti-communist. However, he
was in ill health and had a wife and a number of children, which made it difficult
for him to break with the Castro regime. Menendez expressed the opinion that
Rodriguez was saving some money to be prepared for the day when he receives
orders to return to Havana, at which time he would most likely disregard his
instruction and remain outside of Cuba. His wife is outspokenly anti-communistic.
Menendez described the Legation as not being exactly a hotbed of activity.
Chores are minor and involve mainly contact with other bloc diplomatic repre-
sentatives and increasingly closer contact with the Austrian Communist Party.
While under Gainza's regime locals were hired by the Legation, now they are taken
on only upon recommendation by the Austrian CP.
i
KOPLENIG, FISCHER and other Austrian Communist leaders were fréquent visitors
to the Cuban Legation, Menendez said, as was an Austrian newspaperman by the name
of Bruno FREY, who had lived some time in Mexico. Menendez believed that Frey
was on the Cuban payroll, furnishing political information on the Austrian scene.
Frey's daughter, Elizabeth, was employed by the Legation as a receptionist.
Formerly, the Legation employed a Peruvian by the name of Dr. José CALDERÓN as
translator. Calderón, however, stauchly anti-communistic and a good Catholic,
was fired. He was replaced by a lady with the first name of DORA, recommended by
the the Austrian CP. Another Austrian woman, whose name Menendez did not recall,
assists her part time. The Palenques live in the same building in which the
Legation is located, on Wiedner Hauptstrasse No. 47, but on a different floor.
Behar lives nearby.
Menendez described his own work as insignificant, and said he was mainly
concerned with the monthly mailing of 2000 copies of a cultural magazine, which
was edited in Havana but translated into German by the Legation. Additional copies
were given out by the Legation to visitors. Moreover, he attended cultural
functions and lectured in Austrian institutes of higher learning on Cuba. He also
assisted in the recent drive of the Cuban Government for the hiring of foreign
technicians and interviewed Austrian technicians interested in working in Cuba.
He set the mumber of those interviewed at six. Menendez claimed not to have had
access to classified information and said that Mrs. Palenque, who controlled the
X safe was so careful, that he was not able to take any papers out when he defected.
He claimed to have had no knowledge of the intelligence and communications work
effected by the Legation, although he said he was sure that they had no radio
equipment. Pouches were delivered weekly to the Czech Embassy in Vienna for
transmittal to Prague and onward to Havana. A Cuban diplomatic courier came once
a monthon a swing through the European capitals.
There was only one Cuban student in Austria. He was David GARCIA Santamaria,
studying in Graz. In Menendez opinion, Garcia was disillusioned with Castro.
and would probably not return to Cuba.
A visitor frequently seen in the Legation was DOMINGUEZ (fnu), a Spanish exile,
who was active in the World Peace Organization. Menendez recalled also that
during the last few months, he had seen three Americans at the Legation. One was a

student, whom he characterized as a beatnik type who came with a girl, who
probably was also an American, inquiring about the possibility of obtaining a visa
for Cuba. The second man, whose name he believed to have been Robert GOOD, came
five or six times in June. He was also interested in going to Cuba. He thought
that Mr. Good was about 30 years old. Finally, about eight months ago a
Mr. PORTER called at the Legation. Mr. Porter, who returned to the Legation in
June, claimed to be an ex-serviceman; to have been in the US Army and to have
participated in the Normandy landings. Porter described himself as a student of
history and sociology at the University of Vienna and asked for magazines and
books about present day Cuba.
Menendez was reluctant to tell anything about his training for his job,
and claimed to have been instructed briefly in the Foreign Office by RUIZ DE VELASCO
on cultural affairs. He alleged that he received his position through a passing
acquaintance with Cuba's present Ambassador to Bolivia Roberto AJA, whom he
befriended during the Batista regime.
Comment: From Menendez' story and the Spanish police report it appears that
his motivation for defection was only in part-if at all-connected with his
ideological opposition to Castro. At the Legation, working as a receptionist-
typist was a Spanish girl, Matilde HERRERA, and it seems that Menendez got
emotionally involved with her, and when he received orders to return, he abandoned
his wife and son and followed her to Spain, where she had gone a few days before
him. It would appear that Menendez had a more active part in the operation of the
Legation than he admits, and at least in the times of Gainza had access to
classified material. This he plays down, because his stay in Spain depends on his
ability to convince the Spanish authorities that he had never been a Communist ani
that he is only a small fish. Additional debriefing on some intelligence points
will be conducted through CAS channels.
