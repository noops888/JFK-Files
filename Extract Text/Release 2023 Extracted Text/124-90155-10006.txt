JOHANNA HANSEN ROSS

Source repeated that ROSS was recruited while
working at the Anglo-American School in Moscow at the end of
1962 or early 1963. The reason for recruitment was her access
to personnel of the Embassy and it was particularly planned to
use ROSS, who was of immoral character, against code clerks
of the Embassy. He repeated that the basis for recruitment
was blackmail following her involvement sexually with a Negro
agent of KGB from one of the African states. Source mentioned
KGB had color photographs of ROSS engaging in sexual relations
in 1958, however, these pictures revealed intimacy with a
Russian and KGB did not feel this constituted sufficient evidence
to blackmail this particular person
