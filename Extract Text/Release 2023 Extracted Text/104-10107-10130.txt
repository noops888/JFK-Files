1. See our IN 66370 from (Dakar) (This is our copy.
It is RYBAT, and therefore we can't make a copy.) (DRJIBE/1

2. A reliable source indicates that the District Attorney's
office in New York maintains a routine contact with the INTERPOL
Chief in Treasury. Mr. Hogan's officer is Cantrell. He has a
direct contact with Douglas, the INTERPOL representative in
Washington. In December 1967, the District Attorney's office
in New York City, through Cantrell, triggered an inquiry by
INTERPOL, Washington, to Scotland Yard, London, regarding
Herbert Itkin's travel from London at a particular time and on a
particular flight. It is assumed, therefore, that the request to
(Dakar also originated with Hogemsoffice.

3. Regarding Itkin's allegations of contact with the Agency
during the period 1954-1961, Mr. Sam Papich noted that the
individuals in Senator Joseph McCarthy's Investigative Staff in
1954 were:
Frank CARR
Jim GIULIANO
Don SURINE
CARR, he said, was Chief of the Investigative Staff and would certainly
have known of any contacts maintained by McCarthy under circumstances
alleged by Itkin. Mr. Papich did not know CARR's present whereabouts.
GIULIANO was an assistant. He was last reported to have been practicing
law in Washington. Both GIULIANO and CARR are quite approachable,
Mr. Papich thought. He recommended against querying Mr. SURINE.
