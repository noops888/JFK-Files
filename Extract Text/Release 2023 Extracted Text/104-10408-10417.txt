Dear Dick,
10510 15 October, 1968.
Your Melbourne_Station has sought my views
on the possibility of declassifying a Warren Commission
document in which reference is made to the. Australian)
security service" The document in question is CD 971
dated 22nd May, 1964, together with an attachment dated
29th November, 1963.
I would recommend strongly that CD.971 and
its attachment should not on any account be declassified or
publicly released for reasons which include the following:
(1)
It has never been officially stated that there
is a "C.1.A. Canberra Station" or that
there are C.I.A. officers in Australia
This has been avoided as a point of policy.
(ii)
Publication of these facts would invoke a
spate of questions by the Press and in the
Parliament) which would be contrary to the
national security interest, for example :
(a) Who approved the establishment of
the "C.I.A. Canberra Station"?
(b) What is its composition and location?
(c) What is its purpose in Australia?
(Allegations have already been made
that C.I.A. is interfering in Aust
(ralian domestic affairs.)
(d) With what Australian agencies does it
deal?
(A.S.I.S., which has not been
publicly disclosed, could be brought
into discussion.)
(e) With what other foreign agencies does the
A.S.I.O, deal?
(f) What Ministerial control is there over
such dealings?

(iii)
Questions could be raised as to the investigation
by the A.S.L.O of the anonymous telephone
calls, the validity of its quoted conclusion and
the result of its further enquiries.
Station.
I am giving a copy of this letter to your Melbourne
With kindest regards and best wishes.
Yours
