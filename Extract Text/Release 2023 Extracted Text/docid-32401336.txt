b. Arif has plans to announce
the make-up of his cabinet today.
It will probably contain some "mild"
Baathists.
c. He permitted Syrian strong-
man Hafiz and Michel Aflaq, the
founder of the Baath Party, who were
caught in Baghdad by the coup, to
fly back to Damascus yesterday after
the Syrian radio suddenly stopped
vilifying the newest Iraqi regime.
d. Arif and his colleagues
obviously hope to reach an under-
standing with the Syrian regime. We
doubt very much if they are interested,
however, in the meaningful political
and military unity the previous re-
gime was aiming for.

in positions of power in Baghdad also
tends to ease the threat to the party

c. Roving bands of Communist-

generally unsuccessful strike with
gunfire. There were at least nine
deaths (some reports go as high as
19). Guerrilla activity in rural
areas is also being stepped up.

INTELLIGENCE CHECKLIST
ISSUED BY THE
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
NW 65360 Docld:32401336 Page 11
21 NOVEMBER 1963
TOP SECRET-
1.
Iraq
a.
The new 21-man cabinet ap-
pears to be a coalition of Arab
nationalist elements including four
members of the moderate wing of the
Baath Party. The regime is still
dominated by the military, with eight
cabinet posts.
b. The new prime minister,
Tahir Yahya, is sympathetic to the
Baath Party, and both the Baathists
and the Egyptians feel they can
trust him.
c. The political affiliation
of eight of the new ministers is
not known, but the key interior post
is in the hands of an anti-Baathist
nationalist.
2. Indonesia
a. Defense Minister Nasution
has been ordered by Sukarno to make
conciliatory statements on Malaysia
while on his trip abroad.
b. The Dutch chargé who re-
ported this explained that Nasution
was chosen for this job because
Sukarno was irritated with the ultra-
tough line the defense minister has
taken.
NW 65360 Docld:32401336 Page 12
For The President Only - Tep Secret
(Cont'd)
c.
The chargé has no informa-
tion on the motives behind this
switch. Our embassy thinks it may
be a move to pave the way for explora-
tory talks by Foreign Minister Suband-
rio at Bangkok with his Thai and
Philippine counterparts. It may also
be meant to provide a more recep-
tive attitude for Nasution's visit
here.
d. Our embassy thinks Nasution
went in for his Malaysia sabre rat-
tling on Sukarno's orders, or at
the very least, with the president's
tacit support. Sukarno may feel
Nasution has stolen some of his
thunder.
3. Congo
a. Adoula still did not get
around to announcing the expulsion
of all Soviet and Czech embassy per-
sonnel yesterday. However, his
Dr people managed on Tuesday afternoon
to corral and hog-tie the Soviet
counselor and press attaché before
they could eat-up all the incrimin-
ating papers in their possession.
1,
b. The Russians are now being
held at Ndolo prison. The Congolese
surete says the seized papers include,
(among other things, minutes of a
"liberation committee" meeting of op-
position politicians in Brazzaville,
and a document showing Soviet pay-
ments to this group.
For The President Only-Top Secret
(Cont'd)
NW 65360 Docld:32401336 Page 13
c.
The Belgian ambassador
thinks these papers are probably
genuine. He says the Russians have
made the mistake of underrating the
Congolese and have stumbled into a
surete trap.
d. The Congolese also picked
up two Czech diplomats but have since
released them. This morning they
arrested the correspondent of the
Soviet news agency.
4.
Ethiopia-
Congo
a. Haile Selassie is planning
to withdraw all Ethiopian troops

1 % from the Congo in January, according
b. The two battalions of
Ethiopians provide the guts of the
UN operation. They had been slated
to stay until June and are likely to
be very difficult to replace.
c. The Emperor reportedly
ordered the withdrawal on grounds
that the troops are urgently needed
in Ethiopia, particularly in view
of the Soviet military accord with
Somalia,
d. Our ambassador has asked
to see the Emperor, as well as the
prime minister and foreign minister,
to press for reconsideration.

5. Yemen
a. Military activity has
slackened but the stalemate continues.
b. Egypt still has about 32,000
troops in Yemen, and Saudi Crown
Prince Faysal believes Nasir will
not withdraw any significant number
of them before 4 January when the
extension of the disengagement agree-
ment expires.
c. Faysal is preparing to re-
sume aid to the royalists at that
time; he is stockpiling quantities
of arms and ammunition along the
border.

JFK Act 5 (g)(2)(D)
6. Turkey
a. The opposition Justice
Party, heir of the old Menderes re-
gime, appears to have won a victory
in Sunday's nationwide local elec-
tions on the basis of incomplete re-
turns.
b. The collapse of Prime Min-
ister Inonu's coalition government
appears increasingly likely. Though
a new coalition may be formed, there
will be considerable resistance to
the retention of Inonu as prime min-
ister.

c. Justice Party members will
be putting on pressure for early
national parliamentary elections.
However their party leaders do not
believe the Turkish military, which
ousted Menderes in 1960, would per-
mit them to take over if they won
new elections.
d. They will probably try to
work out some rapprochement with the
armed forces.

A.
Cuba The U-2 which flew yesterday's mission over
Cuba crashed while returning, about 40 miles north
of Key West. Air and sea rescue craft were sent to
the scene. An air rescue unit sighted an unopened
parachute, a life raft, and oil slick in the crash
area. The pilot is presumed lost. There is no in-
dication that the plane was attacked.
B. Berlin n Local East German troops acting without
higher authority appear to have been responsible
for turning high powered searchlights on pilots tak-
ing off from West Berlin's Tempelhof airfield on
14-16 November. There were five such incidents. A
message of 16 November instructed border guard ele-
ments to discontinue such acts. There have been no
further incidents reported since.

and his two passengers were killed. The incident
comes at a time when Soviet President Brezhnev is
visiting Tehran. He addressed a joint session of
parliament today.

Venezuela Police seem to have restored order in
downtown Caracas, but terrorism contimes elsewhere.
The slum district of Caracas to which the terrorists
retreated is under virtual martial law. Among other
things, the Dupont paint warehouse at Maracaibo was
set afire_and totally destroyed.
F. World Peace Council L The WPC meeting in Warsaw next
Thursday may wind up in another free-for-all. The
Chinese Communist delegation, although not intent on
disrupting the conference, plans to attack the WPC
president's report given to a committee meeting in
Vienna last September. The Japanese delegates plan
to give general support to the Chinese and will try
to forestall a vote on the Moscow test ban treaty.

their new responsibilities. There
are, however, a few signs of dissen-
sion within this group and between
it and civilian politicians.
g. One of the more ambitious
and troublesome figures is the able
but opportunistic General Ton That
Dinh, the new Minister of Security.
He has been travelling about the
country spreading the idea that the
coup was largely his doing and seems
bent on developing his own independ-
ent base of power. He is a man to
watch.
h. The new regime has also
embarked on a purge of high military
officers who sided with Diem during
the Buddhist crisis and failed to
get on the right side soon enough.
(INTERCEPTS)
2. Venezuela
a. The death toll from the
terrorist outburst in Caracas last
Tuesday and Wednesday now stands at
about 30.
b. This is the high water mark
thus far in the campaign of the
Castro-supported Communist extremists
to disrupt the national elections a
week from tomorrow.

c. The Betancourt government
has struck back hard. Its new uni-
fied command over the security forces,
passed this
initial test with flying colors.
d. At least 500 extremists
were arrested and the round-up is
still going on. Their removal will
hamper the Communist drive against
elections in major cities like Caracas.
e. We now expect the elections
to be held on schedule, a consider-
able achievement under the circum-
stances. The elections will be fol-
lowed, however, by a Communist ef-
fort to prevent the March inaugura-
tion of the victor.
f. The rub here is that none
of the presidential candidates com-
mands President Betancourt's con-
siderable assets for dealing success-
fully with the harsh realities of
Venezuelan politics. The constitu-
tion prevents Betancourt from suc-
ceeding himself.
g. In the background, as
always, looms the military, which
could intervene if the president-
elect shows signs of being soft on
communism.

d. This sort of harassment
stopped in the spring of 1962 when
Soviet leaders became convinced
that the US was interested in a
serious discussion of a Berlin settle-
ment. Moscow may hope that the
threat of more of this sort of har-
assment will jog the US into talks
on Berlin.
5. Iraq-Syria-
UAR
a. It now appears that Presi-
dent Arif's role in last Monday's
coup in Baghdad may have been vir-
tually that of a bystander.
c. Whatever Arif's role may
have been, the coup was primarily
an effort by the Iraqi Army to cur-
tail the activities of the extreme
wing of the Baath Party. The Baath
is an Arab nationalist political or-
ganization, active throughout the
Arab world, which has been ruling
Iraq and Syria.

d. The coup group has not
thrown all Baathists out of the
government; there are party members
in the new cabinet.
e. Syrian Baathists have wel-
comed this retention of their Iraqi
brothers. Their attitude springs
from the recognition that the Baath
in Syria cannot stay afloat without
support from Iraq.

f. The reaction of Nasir's
Egypt, which passionately desires
to see the Baath go under, has been
exactly the opposite. Cairo has been
backing off its all-out support for
the coup ever since the new cabinet
was announced.

A.
Congo-USSR Soviet embassy personnel have not yet
left Leopoldville, but their departure is expected
momentarily. They were ordered out of the country
after the Congolese turned up good documentary evi-
dence of their complicity in anti-government plots.
One of the items taken off a Soviet diplomat the
other day was a letter from an anti-Adoula leader
now in Brazzaville asking for funds and arms to over-
throw the Leopoldville government.

B. Britain The Labor Party scored again in the Dundee
West by-election Thursday, increasing its 1959
majority of 719 to a thumping 4,955. Heartened by
this, Labor is now pushing for general elections at
once. Prime Minister Home is not likely to accede.
