ASSASSINATION RECORDS
REVIEW BOARD
Enclosed is the diplomatic note received from the Mexican
government, dated March 12, 1997, which responds to the ARRB's
request for any additional documents that the Mexican
government might have relating to the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy. The Embassy evidently submitted the
request to the Mexican government on June 13, 1996, but did not
report the action through telegraphic channels. in the telegram is to our recent query. The reference
The Mexican government note conveys copies of the
diplomatic notes exchanged between Mexico and the United States
in 1963-1964 regarding the initial U.S. request for Mexican
documents relevant to the investigation into Lee Harvey
Oswald's visit to Mexico in the fall of 1963. Most of these
notes were published in volume XVIII of the Warren Commission
Report. They also duplicate copies of the same correspondence
found in Legal Adviser's and Mexico City post files that are
included in State's collection at NARA. I have stamped
enclosed copies of pages bearing "confidential" classification
markings. I am also enclosing a copy of Mexico City telegram
✓ 3078 of March 31.
According to my records, we have now received responses
from all posts contacted through the A bureau. Minsk remains
ongoing. Final responses have been received from Bonn, Paris,
London, Moscow, and now Mexico City. Interim responses have
been received from from Tokyo and Ottawa. As it has been some
time since Tokyo reported that the Japanese government would be
searching for documents, the ARRB might wish to prepare a
followup cable.

Re: Request to CIA to contact liaison channels regarding LIENVOY intercepts of
Oswald telephone calls in Mexico City
Some time ago the Review Board requested informally that CIA contact its liaison
channels in Mexico City for information related to Lee Harvey Oswald. During your
recent visit here we discussed with you the feasibility of your making such contacts. I
am writing in response to your request that we memorialize our request and provide
some background information.
The Review Board believes that all reasonable steps should be taken to account for all
telephonic intercepts of Oswald during his visit to Mexico City in September-October
1963. There is evidence that CIA intercepted some telephone calls through an operation
named LIENVOY (conducted jointly with components of the Mexican government, We
believe that it would be appropriate for CIA to contact directly Mexico City liaison
channels to inquire as to whether the Mexican authorities retained copies of LIENVOY
telephonic take, specifically the actual recordings of Oswald's telephone calls to the
Soviet Embassy during the period of September 27 through October 3, 1963.
The Review Board previously has sought information from the Mexican Government
through appropriate diplomatic channels. For reasons that are obvious to those
familiar with Mexico City issues, the Review Board could not raise with Mexican
officials nor with the U.S. State Department the possible existence of additional tape
recordings that might be in the hands of certain officials. Thus, at the behest of the
Review Board, the Department of State requested that the Mexican federal government
and local government agencies conduct general searches of their files for records
related to the assassination of President Kennedy. The Mexican government responded

by sending copies of the same documentation and correspondence that the GOM had
made available to the Warren Commission in 1964.
The basis for our interest in your contacting appropriate Mexican officials is found in
CIA document 104-10004-10199, which was reviewed by the Board on September 19,
1995. On page 5 of this document (not including the cover sheet) information that the
Board agreed to protect, due to the sensitivity of sources and methods involved,
suggests that the Mexican security forces may have had their own copy of the October 1
intercept on Lee Harvey Oswald. It is unclear whether this statement refers to the
transcript or to an actual tape containing the phone call. Nevertheless, it provides
enough evidence to warrant additional inquiries on this matter.
For your reference we are enclosing copies of the reference documents as well as copies
of the correspondence between the DOS and the Mexican government.
We would appreciate your contacting appropriate officials to determine what
reasonably can be known about this and related matters, and ask that you provide a
response to this request by November 14, 1997. We are fully aware of the sensitivity of
this type of request and do not wish to take any action that would compromise existing
intelligence operations. If necessary, we would be pleased to discuss with you ways in
which we might further elaborate on this request, including person-to-person
discussions with appropriate officials either here or in Mexico.
Thank you for your continued assistance and cooperation.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Thomas Pallas, DO/LA
Fred Wickham, DO/IMS
FROM: John F. Pereira
Chief, CSI/HRG
SUBJECT: Priority Request from Chairman,
JFK Assassination Records Board
1. (S) The purpose of this memorandum is to advise you of a
priority request from the Chairman of the JFK Assassination Records
Review Board (ARRB). The request concerns records related to Lee
Harvey Oswald that may be held by the Mexican Government.
2. (S) At his initiative, I met recently with the ARRB
Chairman, Judge John Tunheim. He said the reason for the meeting was
to ask that CIA assist the Board by making inquiries to liaison to
determine if the Mexican Government has certain records related to
Oswald's activities in Mexico in late 1963. Of particular interest
to the Board is whether the Mexicans have copies of tapes from joint )
(tel-tap operations, including coverage of Oswald's telephone calls
to the Soviet Embassy. He said that locating such records is "the
highest priority of the Board." (The attached letter from the
ARRB's General Counsel explains the Board's interest.)
3. (S) Earlier this year, the Board sought unsuccessfully
to obtain information about Oswald from the Mexican Government
via the State Department. (See attached cable.) Mexico responded
by providing copies of the same material that had been made
available to the Warren Commission in 1964. The problem for the
Board was that, in making the request to Mexico, it did not want
to reveal information about tightly-held joint operations that
the Board knew of from CIA records. Being sensitive to the
Agency's request to protect this information, Tunheim would like
the Agency to contact (Mexican liaison directly on the Board's
behalf.

(S) At his request, I met with the Chairman of the JFK Board, Judge Jack Tunheim this morning for more than an hour. A principal
topic of discussion was the status of the Agency's response to Tunheim's request that we ask Mexican liaison to provide records and
other information related to Oswald's time in Mexico. (The station is following up on a preliminary response from liaison.)
(FOUO) Tunheim described efforts the Board is making to obtain records directly from the KGB, with State Department assistance. Not
much success so far.
(FOUO) We also discussed the general relationship between the Board and CIA, about which he was very positive. He is aware that we
have added resources to step up the pace of our review in view of the 1 September deadline. He said that he does not see much chance
that Congress would extend the Board's charter again.
Ed: Tunheim asked that we set up a meeting with you on 18 Feb, when he'll be in town for a meeting of the Board.

CIA-IR-05 Possible Foreign Source for Records on Oswald
The Review Board requested that the CIA assist in locating and acquiring records
relevant to Lee Harvey Oswald and the assassination of President John Kennedy which
might exist in the files of a foreign government agency. Due to the foreign liaison
sensitivity of this request, information on this issue was passed between the CIA,
Review Board Chairman Judge John Tunheim, and one Review Board staff member.
On September 15, 1998, Chairman Tunheim and I flew to Houston to consult with CIA
Directorate of Operations officers on the likelihood of the existence of additional
records and the possibility that the CIA would be successful in acquiring these records.
These CIA officers demonstrated that they had consulted numerous times with the
senior officials of the foreign government but had, thus far, been unsuccessful in
obtaining additional records or in confirming, visually, the existence of additional
records. The CIA agreed to continue to work to obtain these records.

Re: Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board's Requests for
Additional Information and Records
Dear John:
I am writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious
concern about the status of CIA's responses to the Review Board's requests for
additional information and records. Although CIA has completed its responses to
several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of
requests have not been answered - including some that were made more than two
years ago. On many occasions we have been assured that responses would be
forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers. It is now
extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct
a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the
highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (**)¹ and we request
that they be answered within the next month. We request that the remaining requests
be answered by April 1, 1998.
The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts: first, a listing of the formal
requests for information and records, and second, a listing of the informal requests for
information and records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the
following points differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.
