2023 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
3-E-C-R-E-T
24 AUG 1965
MEMORANDUM FOR: Acting Deputy Chief, WIID for Cuba
SUBJECT : Attempted Assassination of CASTRO June 1965.
REFERENCE : COSMA-19783, 11 August 1965
1. On returning to Madrid ca 10 August (QUANTUM-51),
Spanish diplomat who has been in Havana for years, reported
that Mario SALABARRIA Aguiar, former Commandante in the Cuban
National Police 1944-47 and chief of Police Intelligence
(SIIE) 1945-47, and 27 unidentified persons were arrested for
conspiring to kill Fidel CASTRO late in June or early July 1965.
According to (QUANTUM-51) who talked with members of his family,
SALABARRIA had sworn to avenge the death of Eufemio FERNANDEZ
Ortega, former National Police Captain. As the leader of this
conspiracy, SALABARRIA worked closely with Dr. Bernardo MILANES
Lopez who drew up the assassination plans and allegedly obtained
money and weapons from the United States. MILANES, according to
(QUANTUM-51)'s information, was arrested before the plotters were
ready to carry out their plans. SALABARRIA then advanced the
date set for the assassination. The conspiracy was discovered
and he was arrested. When his wife learned that SALABARRIA was
to be condemned to death, she went to Fidel to plead for her
husband's life. Fidel, who at one time had been their friend,
denied knowledge of SALABARRIA's case but assured her that his
life would be spared. According to (QUANTUM-51) SALABARRIA's
wife knows nothing further of her husband's fate.
2. News of SALABARRIA's role in an abortive assassination
attempt and of his arrest is significant confirmation of current
reports regarding the exposure of a plot to kill CASTRO in
Havana in June-July 1965. The Agency has known of Mario
SALABARRIA's conspiratorial activities and personal dedication
to his role as Fidel's murderer since the summer of 1963. At
that time SALABARRIA was seeking weapons and funds for his
mission. Through his confidant, AMTURVY-4, a barkeep on the
Havana waterfront and a long time friend of (QUANTUM-51), he
sought contact with AMTURVY-1, then a minor GOC official.
SALABARRIA had known AMTURVY-1's brother, AMCONCERT-1, for
twenty years and he assumed that AMTURVY-1 was in touch with the
Agency through AMCONCERT-1 in Miami. Accordingly at their first
meeting in the summer of 1963 in AMTURVY-4's bar, SALABARRIA
told AMTURVY-1 that he was a member of a group which was plotting
CASTRO's death. He asked AMTURVY-1 to help him obtain money and
weapons for this conspiracy. He emphasized, in particular, that
he needed money to purchase vehicles which were essential if the
group were to succeed in their mission. In return for whatever
17--138660
13-00000
AMTURVY-1 could furnish, SALABARRIA offered to carry out minor
sabotage actions for AMTURVY-1's American "contacts". A few
months later in October 1963, when we were satisfied with
SALABARRIA's bonafides, we managed to get a few pistols,
revolvers and some sabotage materials into SALABARRIA's hands
through AMTURVY-4. SALABARRIA responded with a plea for more,
but denied that he could retrieve an arms cache from a site on
the north coast. AMTURVY-1 became cynical about SALABARRIA's
plans and then in response to our instructions he abandoned
direct contact with SALABARRIA early in 1964. SALABARRIA,
however, continued to see AMTURVY-4 who kept in touch with both
AMTURVY-1 and (QUANTUM-51).
3. Meanwhile, SALABARRIA's accomplice, Dr. Bernardo MILANES
Lopez, prominent Havana doctor who was the personal physician of
CASTRO's mother for 15 years until her death in July 1963, was
recruited in November-December 1963 while on a visit to Madrid.
During the course of his recruitment, MILANES stated that he
was active in a group of conspirators who were plotting to kill
CASTRO. He alluded to disgruntled Rebel Army officers and medical
colleagues, but he did not name SALABARRIA among those few he
identified as persons of trust. He did, however, spell out the
groups needs for weapons, money and vehicles in order to carry
out their assassination mission. And, he finally agreed to
serve as a collection agent in return for limited financial
compensation and in the apparent hope that we would in time
furnish him with sufficient funds for the needed vehicles.
Following his return to Havana in January 1964, MILANES proved
to be a fairly regular S/W correspondent, a source of some Order
of Battle. While he repeatedly urged us to help him obtain the
vehicles for his group, he never disclosed to us how deeply
involved he, himself, was in the plot to kill CASTRO. We
subsequently learned that he had informed SALABARRIA of his
recruitment by CIA in Madrid and that he had tried to persuade
SALABARRIA to work directly with him rather than with AMTURVY-4.
4. MILANES was arrested in the company of his chauffeur
and nephew, both fully witting of his clandestine activities
for the Agency and presumably equally involved in the conspiracy
to kill CASTRO. From the limited evidence acquired to date,
it appears that MILANES' arrest may have been prompted by the
blackmarketeering of his nephew, censorship of his mail or
physical surveillance. In any case, it is known that he had
in his possession compromising Agency commo equipment and S/W
materials.
