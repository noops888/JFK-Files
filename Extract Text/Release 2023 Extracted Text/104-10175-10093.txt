MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD.
1. Mr. Kanes of WE/6 informed me this morning that the Agency had
not yet had their discussion with British Liaison concerning LICOOKY.
2. I was unable to reach Mr. Kanes of Mr. Ginsburg, but I talked
by phone with Mrs. Owen of the British Embassy. Although we had
previously approved passing to the British the statement that LICOOKY
was an indirect contact of our on Guatemalan exile activities, we would
like to have that changed. I told Mr. Yimes to pass the following.
"LICOOKY has been used as a sub-source by our Station,
however, she has been considered unreliable and is not a good
security risk. Therefore we do not recommend her for
operational use." If possible, if the British do not raise
the subject, it would better to drop the whole thing.
C. Z. Bustos-Videla.
