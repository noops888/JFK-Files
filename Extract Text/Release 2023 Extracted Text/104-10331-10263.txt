Statement of
Steven D. Tilley, Chief of the Access and Freedom of Information Staff
National Archives and Records Administration
Bofore the
Subcommittee on National Security, International Affairs, and Criminal Justice
Committee on Government Reform and Oversight
House of Representatives
June 1, 1997
Mr. Chairman, I am Steven D. Tilley, Chief of the Access and Freedom of Information Act Staff
of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). I wish to thank you for the
opportunity to testify today on behalf of NARA in support of H.R. 1553, which will extend the
authorization of the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Review Board for one year to
September 30, 1998. I am appearing today in my capacity as NARA's Chief of the Prosidant John
F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection. In that role I am charged with implementing
NARA's responsibilities under the Act and I serve as NARA's liaison to the Assassination
Records Review Board (ARRB). This aftermoon I would like to tell you a little bit of my
background concerning records of the assassination of President Kennedy, explain the role of
NAKA in implementing the Act, and outline why the National Archives and Records
Administration supports passage of this important piece of legislation."
Mr. Chairman, my career as an archivist has involved working with some of the most sensitive
and highly classified records of our Govemment. I oversaw the closing of the office of the
Watergate Special Prosecution Force (WSPF) and supervised the transfer of these recorde to the
National Archives in 1977. I worked with the records of the WSPF for more than 11 years,

serving for most of that thue as the senior archivist for those records. I also served as the senior
archivist for the records of the National Security Council (NSC) following the transfer of the NSC
records of the Truman and Eisenhower Administrations in 1983. In 1989 I joined the staff of the
National Security Council, where I served as Director of Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Act
Activities and later as NSC's Director of Information Disclosure with responsibility for all
disclosure activitios of the NSC. In 1993, I roturned to NARA to become the Chief of the IFK
Collection, and I have served in that capacity ever since. I became the Chief of the Access and
FOLA. Staff in January of this year.
Linder the IFK Act, NARA had several major responsibilities. Three of these requirements,
Lowever, proved to be central to the work of the Assassination Records Review Board. Our first
responsibility was to formally establish the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Rocords
Collection which we accomplished with the publication of an announcement in the Ecderal
Register on December 21, 1992. As established on that date, the Collection only consisted of
open records already in NARA's custody, primarily the records of the Warren Commission.
Secondly, within 45 days of the statute being sigued, NAR A was required to prepare and make
available standard identification forms for use by all government offices in describing assassination
records and to create a database of these forms to serve as an electronic finding aid to the JFK
Collection. Our third responsibility, which we shared with other government offices, was to
identify, review, and make available to the public all assassination records that could be disclosed
under the provisions of the law within a 300 day review period Descriptions of all records
reviewed were required to be entered into the database whore they would be mado widely
available to the public.

Af the end of the review period in August 1993, newly released records were made available for
research, including most of Loc Harvey Oswald's 201 Personality file, part of the Coutral
Intelligence Agency's "segregated collection" of assassination related documents, and the records
of the House Select Committee on Assassinations. The database was also available for use by
researchers on that day.
When the ARRB members were confirmed by the Senate in April, 1994, ury staff and I bogan to
work with the Board and later with the Board's staff, to provide information on the records in
the Collection at that time, the development and use of the database, our contacts and discussions
with other agencies involved in searches for assassination related documents, and the existence of
assassination records in the custody of private repositories or individuals. The ARRB and NARA
have maintained an excellent working relationship luvugh the 3 years of the Board's existence,
and I would like to think that this close relationship has in some way contributed to the success of
the ARRB.
NARA enthusiastically supports passage of H.R. 1553 to extend the ARRB's authorization. Our
mission is not unlike that of the ARRB. 10 cosure roady access to assential dooumontary
evidence. In the Board's case the essential evidence is any records relating to the assassination of
President Kennedy. In our case essential evidence consists of all foderal and presidential records
that document the rights of American citizens, the actions of federal officials, and the national
oxperience. The Review Board needs the time designated in this bill to complete its important
work in making available as complete zu historical record as possible concerning the

assassination of President Kennody. We would like to offer for your consideration some statistics
and facts to demonstrate the success of the Board and support its onc-year extension.
The John F. Keanody Assassination Records Collection today bears little resemblance to the
Collection that was established in December 1992. At that time, the Collection consisted of
approximately 450 cubia fact of records from a few agencies. Today, the Collection has grown to
more than 1,600 cubic feet of records or 3.75 million pages from more than 30 different
government offices. Those numbers are a testament to the work of the Review Board in
obtaining the cooperation of the entire Federal government in this important task.
The ARRB bos not only succeeded in obtaining the cooperation of the Federal agencies but has
also negotiated the donation of very important records that were previously held in private hands.
Donations have included the related papers of James Garrison and Edward Wegmann, the
prosecutor and defense attorney in the conspiracy trial of Clay Shaw, and the papers of J. Lee
Rankin, the General Counsel and Chief of Staff of the Warren Commission. Copies of the papers
of Sonator Richard Russell, a member of the Warren Commission, that were donated to the
University of Georgia are being reviewed and we hope will be made part of the Collection in the
near future with the agreement of the University. For the information of the Committee, Mr.
Chairman, I have attached to my testimony a copy of the Register of the Collection, which lists
the major groups of Federal records and private papers, along with the supplemental listing of FBI
files.

Not only hus the Collection increased dramatically in size, the significance of the records in the
Collection cannot be overestimated. In addition to the records of numerous Executive branch
agencies and offices, the records of relevant Congressional committees, related court cases, and
records donated by private entities are available in the Colloction. This rich documentation is
searchable electronically, giving researchers the ability to sock out documents concerning a topic,
person, of eyeut, or even individual documents, not only at NARA's College Park facility, but
from their own personal computer through the Intermot. Equally important, the Collection
provides researchers with a view of how our government worked during this period in history, as
the documents reflect not only the operations of government as the offices and agencies reacted to
the death of the President but also how these offices and agencies were operating in regard to
other events that are related to tho assassination, such as the campaign to destabilize the
government of Cuba or the FBI's investigation of various organized crime figures. Perliaus Uus
unique window on the operations of these agencies may be the most important rosult of the
development of the Collection.
Furthermore, the Collection continues to grow. Additional FBI records will he added in the
weeks and months ahead. Records of the Departments of the Army and Navy and the Joint
Chief of Staff are currently under review. The addition of these records will only add to the
richness of the Collection and increase its value to the genoral research community.
Public demand for those records is the ultimate evidence of the the value of the Collection.
Reference requests have risen in mumber every year since the Collection opcued with new records
in August 1993. This year we have already roccived close to 600 written inquiries, an increase of

30% over this time last year. The number of inquiries on our computer website is also steadily
increasing. Since March, 1996 when the Collection was made available through tho NARA
website, the assassination records have been accessed over 100,000 times by the public. Many of
the written inquiries we receive include copies of record identification forms taken from the
database, showing that the researcher has accessed our website and downloaded information. The
availability of the database via the Internet remains one of the most important developments that
have come from this process.
Due to the exceptional work of the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Review Board, great
progress has been made on making available as complete a record as possible on the history of the
assassination of John Kennedy. Without the focus, integrity, and exportise of the ARRB, the
Collection would not have the size, quality, or public demand witnessed today. However, there is
still much to do. NARA supports passage of H.R. 1553 so that this important work can be
completed.
