was concerned with administrative problems associated with the phase-
out of the Station. Despite the consequent operational lull, Subject
continued to maintain a satisfactory degree of morale in agents assigned
him, worked up and implemented realistic training programs, and con-
tinued. to develop excellent targets studies against the possibility of
a policy change. In addition, important information collected locally
by Subject on illegal activities of Cuban refugees was of great interest
to other agencies offices in the area. Subject was the only Station
source of such information which was acquired only because of Subject's
ability to maintain rapport with agents, terminated during the period
because of the cutback in infiltration operations.
It could also be noted as Subject finishes his long tour at this
Station and prepares for his next assignment, that he is a thoroughly
professional intelligence officer and is, in many ways, an outstanding
one. Technically, he is an expert on infiltration tactics and, though
his Special Forces experience, an expert on anti-guerrilla warfare as
well. Just as important, is his ability to gain respect and rapport
with foreign agents. He has an imaginative approach to operations,
is resourceful in devising tactics, and determined in carrying out his
assignments. He is a definite asset to WOFIRM.

one. Technically, he is an expert on infiltration tactics and, though
his Special Forces experience, an expert on anti-guerrilla warfare as
well. Just as important, is his ability to gain respect and rapport
with foreign agents. He has an imaginative approach to operations,
is resourceful in devising tactics, and determined in carrying out his
assignments. He is a definite asset to WOFIRM.
