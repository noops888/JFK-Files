PROJECT 1.IEMPTY
I. CURRENT OBJECTIVES AND RELATED PROJECT ACCOMPLISHMENTS.
A. The overall objective of the LIEMPTY project activity is to collect
operational information on the LIMERICK installation and personnel, as well
as related targets of opportunity, through stationary and mobile photo-
graphic and physical surveillance coverage. Corollary objectives which are
to be fulfilled through the use of the LIEMPTY installations and personnel
are as follows:
1) To provide operational information pertaining to the daily activities
and movements of LIMERICK personnel, particularly those individuals of
intelligence interest, as well as information on the LIMERICK physical
facilities, and visitors to the premises.
2) To collect operational information pertaining to other targets of
opportunity, other official Installations, and persons of intelligence
interest operating in Mexico.
3) To provide operational support and other protective services to Station
personnel and operations as may be deemed necessary.
B. The above objectives are to be fulfilled through the use of the LINTTED,
LILYRIC, and LICALLA fixed installations, the LIENTRAP mobile unit, and the
services of contract agents Raymond H. GERENDE and Oliver G. SCANTLING. These
objectives are in consonance with and represent partial fulfillment of the
following sections of the current Related Mission Directive as approved for
Mexico City Stations
Priority A, Section 1, Subsection e
Priority A, Section 2, Subsection c
C. Throughout the period under review, Project LIEMPTY continued to contribute
directly and significantly to the fulfillment of Station and Headquarters'
requests and requirements for coverage of various targets falling within the
framework of the above cited objectives and the Related Mission Directive.
Specific examples of LIEMPTY progress, accomplishments and contributions by
each project component are as follows:
1) LIMITED
Throughout the reporting period, until operational activity was terainated
and the photographic equipment evacuated from the LIMITED basehouse on
26 September 1964 (because of security implications stemming from the
release of the Warren Commission report, see Section II, CHANGES), the
LIMITED installation provided daily photographic coverage and physical
surveillance of the main gate of LIMERICK installation during the afternoon
and early evening hours. The Station considers the LIMITED photographic

t
coverage an essential and reliable tool for following the daily activities
of the target personnel and the arrival and departure of visitors, some of
whom have been PEFRINS. In addition, the LIMITED installation provided
a fixed radio dispatch base for the LIEMERACS team. Because of the
extremely tight security measures instituted by the local security forces
in the immediate vicinity of the LINERICK installation, stakeouts by the
244 [unilateral surveillance team are precluded. However, with LIMITED
Personnel dispatching the team from positions removed from the protective
security ring, onto targets departing the installation, surveillance
coverage is made possible.
2) LILYRIC
The LILYRIC installation also provided photographic and fixed visual sur-
veillance of the front of the LIMERICK installation throughout the period
under review, during the morning and early afternoon hours. This photo-
graphic coverage and the written logs of the movement of LIMERICK
personnel prepared by LILYRIC personnel, complements the LIMITED coverage
used by the Station in its KUDESK operations against the LIMERICK target
and has been judged to be of equal quality and value to the LIMITED
coverage.
3) LICALLA
The LICALLA installation continued to provide coverage of the back of
the LIMERICK installation, the garden, and patio area where many of the
personnel and their families congregate. This coverage gives the Station
its real insight into the LIMERICK target ani provides a large part of the
information on which the Station bases its identification of LIMERICK
staffers, their rank and positions, the staffing estimates, and the
intelligence connections of the various officers. In addition some
information of LAURICIS interest is provided by LICALLA (see paragraph 2,
section f of HNMA-24235 dated 2 September 1964 for further details).
4) LIENTRAP
A greatly increased use of the LIENTRAP unit was evidenced throughout
the period under review. This asset was employed extensively for photo-
graphic coverage of PCN Headquarters, the PCM Women's Congress, the homes
of PCM members and the residences of foreign Communist exiles in Mexico.
Much of this coverage vas in support of past or planned recruitment
attempts and was needed to provide identifications of other local or
visiting Communists. Specifically LIENTRAP coverage assisted in the
identification and the verification of the address and contacts of
02 LIOXIDE-1, prior to the Station's successful recruitment of this high-
level PCM member. The section primarily responsible for the Station's
anti-PCM activity has classified the LIENTRAP coverage as a most
"valuable" part of their effort.
고래/2

5) PHOTO COVERAGE - GENERAL
During the 9 month period from 1 November to 1 August 1964, the LIEMPTY
project produced approximately 770 rolls of operational still photographs,
of which 595 rolls vere directly concerned with the LIMERICK target. This
coverage, linked with the daily logs kept by the basehouse keepers of the
activities of the LIMERICK personnel, while continually contributing to
the Station's regular CE effort, has been particularly effective during
crisis times such as the OPFLOOR investigations. While the photographic
coverage is used almost exclusively for Station operations in the LIMERICK
area, LIENPTY has also provided direct support to other operations such as
providing verification of a double-agent's visits to the LDERICK
installation.
6). Oliver O. SCANTLING
During the period 1 December 1963 through 30 August 1964, long-term Station
asset, Oliver 0. SCANTLING (ps) continued as the cutout to the LINTTED
basehouse, and made his regular contribution as the alternate contact of
LICASA-1 in this sensitive LAURICLE operation. SCANILING also performed
mumerous pretext investigations, serviced accommodation addresses, and
prepared formal casing reports. Of particular significance were
SCANTLING's regular checks of the accommodation address used in the
02 sensitive AED PULSE Joperation, the thorough investigation of a former
01SOTH Jagent of interest to KUBARK, and detailed casings of the Chinese
Communist Fair. (See also Section VI, PLANS, for SCANTLING's future
operational assignment)..
7) Raymond H. GERENDE
During the period under review, GERENDE continued in his assignment as
the Station cutout to the LILYRIC and LICALLA basehouses, the LIENTRAP
unit and as the processor of the raw photographic take, and with the
assistance of LIEMPTY-10, continued to provide and service the majority
of the accommodation addresses used by the Station. The contributions
made principally by GERENDE (and to a limited extent by SCANTLING) to the
sensitive AMROD operation can accurately be described as unique and
essential to the success of that operation. Although this activity is
necessarily a Headquarters directed effort, the local contributions of
OERENDE and SCANTLING are integral ingredients of that operation.
D. It will be noted from the above samples of LIEMPTY contributions to the
Station's progress towards fulfillment of the pertinent sections of the
Related Mission Directive, that notwithstanding their demonstrable value
and importance, these contributions actually represent only a portion of
the activity directed towards the fulfillment of each objective. Therefore,
any precise measurement of project progress is precluded. However, based
on the performance and overall contributions of the LIEMPTY project during
the past project year, the Station, concludes that this project is essential
to the fulfillment of the Related Mission Directive and must be continued
during the forthcoming project year.

II. CHANGES
A) On 24 September 1964, the Station was informed by Headquarters that a
LIENFTY project photograph which was one of several supplied to the Warren
Commission in November 1963, would be published in that Commission's formal
overt report. Since LIMERICK officials would undoubtedly be able to
recognize the individual in the photographs as a visitor to their
installation and with a view towards the attendant possible security problems,
the LIMITED, LILYRIC, and LICALLA operations were suspended on 26 and 27
September and all photographic and other compromising equipment was evacuated
from these basehouses. All basshouse personnel were briefed in general on the
situation and specifically on how to cope with any possible inquiries from
Government officials or LINERICK inspired or prompted newsmen. Craplete
emergency communications systems yere arranged for all basehouse personnel,
Raymond H. GERENDE and Oliver 6. SCANTLING. Upon receipt by the Station of a
copy of the photograph, it was determined that the LIMITED basehouse had
provided the photograph in question. This consideration, linked with further
analysis of the limitations upon any counteractions available to LIDERICK
officials, allowed the Station to re-activate the LILYRIC and LICALLA bases
on a phased basis in early October 1964. However, because LIMITED was the
originator of the to-be-published photograph and due to the age and deterio-
rated condition of the LIMITED property (owned by KUBARK), Station Mexico
City did not reactivate LIMITED and presented to Headquarters a plan for the
demolition of the present LIMITED structure with recommendations for the
construction of a new building complex. (See MEXI 1307 dated 20 October 1964
for additional details).
B) In accordance with paragraph 2 of HMHW-12297 dated 28 January 1964, the
value and productivity of all assets under Project LIEMPTY was closely
reviewed against the necessary security and efficiency requirements. It was
determined that LIEMPTY-12 and LIEMPTY-8 could be terminated without causing
intolerable gaps in operational coverage or an unacceptable decrease in
efficiency. Both LIENPTY-12 and LIEMPTY-8 were terminated on 30 June 1964;
at the same time, in keeping with the ODYOKE economy program, a further effort
was made to reduce the costs of this project by placing LIENPTY-19 on an
hourly rate for work performed for the Station.
,
C) On 30 September 1964, the field Case Officer responsibility for Project
LIEMPTY was transferred from Jeremy L. NIARCOS to Cornelius L. PEUVION;
however, the analysis of the finished take from the photographic basehouses
continues to be performed by Robert B. RIGGS.
III. EFFECTIVENESS
The effectiveness of the LIEMPTY project must be judged on the basis of the
reliable daily coverage provided rapidly and securely for the Station and
interested Headquarters' components on the LIMERICK installation; the rapid
mobile coverage provided regularly by LIENTRAP; and the support to these and
other operations provided by Raymond H. GERENDE and Oliver G. SCANTLING,
(See Section I, Subsection C for specific examples of this effectiveness).

In the opinion of Station officers who use the LIEMPTY photographic product or
receive LIEMPTY operational support, this project has responded most satisfactorily
to the needs and requirements.
IV. PROBLEMS
A) The only major operational/security problems which confronted project LIEMPTY
during the period under review were the security implications stemming from the
release of the overt Warren Commission report. (See paragraph II, Section A).
The precise damage occasioned locally by the report, cannot be measured until
the mid-November release of the report annex containing the actual LIMITED
photograph. During the interim period, the emergency contact systems aro
being maintained in readiness, the cover stories of all personnel involved
have been reviewed and strengthened, and no undue concern has been displayed
by any of the project personnel. Potential Station countermeasures to the
possible LIMERICK reaction to the publication of the subject photograph were
outlined in NEXI-1018 dated 25 September 1964.
B) No urusual personnel problems have arisen and the overall performance of all
agents connected with this project has been satisfactory.
V. LIAISON AND INTERAGENCY COORDINATION
Not applicable.
VI. PLAN8
A) The future of the LIMITED basehouse, property and personnel will be determined
within the near future. (See Section 2, subsection a). Station has acquired
another apartment on a temporary basis in the LILYRIC complex to replace the
loss of LIMITED coverage and it will be activated after the acquisition and
clearence of basehouse keepers.
B) No basic changes are contemplated in either the administration or operation
of the LICALLA or LILYRIC bases. Station will again initiate motion picture
coverage of selected LIMERICK personnel engaged in conversation in the
garden area in an attempt to obtain film which will lend itself to lipreading
by Headquarters' specialists.
C) The Station plans to maintain the increased level of LIENTRAP operational
activity, with this asset being targetted in the near future against the
Partido Popular Socialista (PPS) in support of the Station's new PPS
penetration program.
D) Effective on 1 September 1964, Raymond H. GERENDE assumed the cutout role
and responsibility for the LIMITED basehouse in addition to his other
operational duties outlined in Section I.. No other basic operational or
administrative changes are planned for GERENDE for the ensuing period.
E) The removal of Oliver 0. SCANTLING as the cutout to the LIMITED basehouse
vas, a result of the recent death of his wife, his pending trip to Japan as
a member of the Mexican Olympic team, and the Station's desire to give
more operational responsibility to Raymond H. GERENDE. After SCANILING'S

VII. EMERGENCY CONDITIONS
Emergency communication plans for Oliver G. SCANTLING and Raymond H. GERENDE
are on file in the Station and at Headquarters (See HMMA-15982 and HMMA-15981 of
23 November 1960). In early 1964, a review was hold for the active agents in
this project of their recontact instructions and verbal recognition signals. In
addition the emergency contact plans for the LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA base-
house keepers were expanded and refined during the "crisis" cutlined in para-
graph II, Section A.

return from Japan, he will assume operational duties and responsibilities in
an activity not connected with Project LIEMPTY. Therefore, salary and
operational expenses for SCANTLING are programmed for six months only.
F) Other than presented above, Mexico City Station plans no other significant
project changes since it is felt that this project is now operating at its
optimun size. Justification for the retention of three basehouses vas
presented in detail in HMA-23343 (which is available at Headquarters).
Efforts will be continued, however, to refine and better utilize the existing
project organization and assets.
VII. COSTS (All figures are dollars, V. 8.)
A) Past Project Year Station records indicate that Project LIEMPTY expended
$35,952.78 during the period 1 December 1963 through 30 September 1964.
Approximately $9,000 will be expended during the remainder of the present
project year. It is estimated that approximately 20 hours of case officer
time per week is necessary to satisfectorily fulfill the operational,
administrative and analytical requirements of this project. Bi-weekly
accoutings with receipts and/or certifications are submitted by Raymond H.
GERENDE and Oliver 0. SCANTLING to the Station Finance Officer, via the
case officer for all Project LIEMPTY expenditures.
B) Ensuing Project Year - Project LIEMPTY was programmed for $60,000 for the
forthcoming project year. Due to the Station's economy measures, however,
only $45,300 is requested for the ensuing year. Of this amount, $27,675 111
be expended in FY 1965 and $17,625 in FY 1966. A detailed breakdown of
project expenditures follows:
