MEMORANDUM FOR ASSISTANT DIRECTOR FOR POLICY COORDINATION:
SUBJECT: Relations Existing Between the Bulgarian National
Committee and the International Rescue Committees
1. Generally reliable source, she is not Bulgarian, has
characterised the International Rescue Committee as a private
organisation created to render assistance to the victims of the
recent war and of Communism. Since IRO is to cease its activities
on 30 June 1950, the International Rescue Committee hoped to carry
on at least a portion of the relief work undertaken by the organisation
among refugees who had been declared ineligible for consideration overseas.
The activities of the International Rescue Committee have suffered,
however, because of failure to raise the necessary funds in the United
States.
2. According to source, the International Rescue Committee,
unlike the IRO, pursues a well-defined political objective, namely to
unite in a single organisation under United States patronage all
democratic and anti-Communist refugees fleeing from the Soviet satellites.
Source declares that the leaders of the International Refugee Committee
consider as truly democratic only those refugees belonging to the
peasant parties of Eastern Europe. Full support is given to these
parties, or rather to their leaders such as Mikolajcsyk for the Poles
and (Dr. George M. Dimitrov) for the Bulgarians. Assistance is denied
to Fascists, former Fascists and individuals who have profited under
Communism in their home countries. In the opinion of source, apart
from the fact that it is not necessary to hold membership in a peasant
party in order to be a true democrat, officials of the International
Refugee Committee apparently wish to forget that Dr. Dimitrov is either
unpopular or actually hated by large segments of the Bulgarian emigration.
The supporters of Dimitrov are merely guests at the Jesi camp. Of the
163 Bulgarian refugees at this camp, 150 belong to the Bulgarian Agrarian
Party. Bulgarian refugees in other Italian camps and in unspecified
camps in Germany, Austria and Switzerland are described as distinctly
hostile to Dimitrov. The Bulgarian committee in France, headed by
Nikola Balabanov, enlists support for Dr. Dimitrov among Bulgarian
refugees in that country.
3. On 13 March 1950, CARE packages were distributed to the 163
Bulgarian refugees at the Jesi camp under the auspices of the Inter-
national Rescue Committee, Mrs. Einsicher, the wife of a vice

on 30 June 1950, the International Rescue Committee hoped to carry
on at least a portion of the relief work undertaken by the organisation
among refugees who had been declared ineligible for consideration overseas.
The activities of the International Rescue Committee have suffered,
however, because of failure to raise the necessary funds in the United
States.
2. According to source, the International Rescue Committee,
unlike the IRO, pursues a well-defined political objective, namely to
unite in a single organisation under United States patronage all
democratic and anti-Communist refugees fleeing from the Soviet satellites.
Source declares that the leaders of the International Refugee Committee
consider as truly democratic only those refugees belonging to the
peasant parties of Eastern Europe. Full support is given to these
parties, or rather to their leaders such as Mikolajcsyk for the Poles
and (Dr. George M. Dimitrov) for the Bulgarians. Assistance is denied
to Fascists, former Fascists and individuals who have profited under
Communism in their home countries. In the opinion of source, apart
from the fact that it is not necessary to hold membership in a peasant
party in order to be a true democrat, officials of the International
Refugee Committee apparently wish to forget that Dr. Dimitrov is either
unpopular or actually hated by large segments of the Bulgarian emigration.
The supporters of Dimitrov are merely guests at the Jesi camp. Of the
163 Bulgarian refugees at this camp, 150 belong to the Bulgarian Agrarian
Party. Bulgarian refugees in other Italian camps and in unspecified
camps in Germany, Austria and Switzerland are described as distinctly
hostile to Dimitrov. The Bulgarian committee in France, headed by
Nikola Balabanov, enlists support for Dr. Dimitrov among Bulgarian
refugees in that country.

SUBJECT: Relations Existing Between the Bulgarian National
Committee and the International Rescue Committees
1. Generally reliable source, she is not Bulgarian, has
characterised the International Rescue Committee as a private
organisation created to render assistance to the victims of the
recent war and of Communism. Since IRO is to cease its activities
on 30 June 1950, the International Rescue Committee hoped to carry
on at least a portion of the relief work undertaken by the organisation
among refugees who had been declared ineligible for consideration overseas.
The activities of the International Rescue Committee have suffered,
however, because of failure to raise the necessary funds in the United
