The following SW message was received from (AT-34) on 18 May
1961. The message also contained intelligence information
which is being reported separately.
(AMOT-106) and (Norberto M. RINEZ) are under surveillance and
have not been able to retrieve equipment (W/T set) due to
constant militia guard of A-106's farm. On 8 May I talked
to (Art) and brought him up to date regarding my equipment
(W/T set) and also about still having my signal plan and
pade intact.
