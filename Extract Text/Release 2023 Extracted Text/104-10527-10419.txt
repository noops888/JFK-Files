AFRICA BRIEF (FOR LIAISON) (ROFORE IN STANTS
1. LERA NON-SYRIA: THE INCURSION INTO LEBANON BY A SYRIAN
PATROL ON 19 OCTOBER AND THE RESULTING CLASH WITH LEBANESE SECURITY
FORCES ARE INDICATIVE OF SYRIAN EXASPERATION WITH LEBANON'S POLICY
TOWARD SYRIA. THE LEBANESE FOR SOME TIME HAVE ALLOWED EGYPTIAN IN-
TELLIGENCE TO USE LEBANON AS A BASE FOR SUBVERSIVE OPERATIONS AGAINST
SYRIA. LEBANESE INTERNAL POLITICS HAVE LED THE SYRIAN REGIME TO
CLOSE ITS EYES TO THESE ACTIVITIES (CONF)
2. MOROCCO-ALGERIA: THE MOROCCAN-ALGERIAN BORDER CONFLICT
SEEMS ON THE VERGE OF ESCALATING AS BOTH COUNTRIES REINFORCE THEIR
TROOPS ALONG THE ENTIRE AREA.
THE ALGERIAN CAPTURE ON 16 OCT OF A SMALL MOROCCAN FRONTIER
POST (NOB
CORON-KACABAR) GAVE ALGERIAN FORCES
FURTHER CLAIM TO A 60-KM STRIP OF TERRITORY AND ARE POISED TO
14-00000
CREATE A FIGHTING AREA OF MOROCCO IN RETALIATION AND TO TRY TO
EXPEL THE ALGERIANS.
SHOULD THE ALGERIANS MOVE TO SEIZE MORE TERRITORY, MOROCCO IS
EXPECTED TO DRESS ITS CASE IN VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL FORA AS WELL
AS TO INTENSIFY ITS REQUESTS FOR WESTERN SUPPORT. AS LONG
AS THE KING IS CONCERNED OVER THE LEGALITY OF ITS CASE BEFORE IN-
TERNATIONAL BODIES, A MOROCCAN STRIKE ON TINDUF BASE IS UNLIKELY.
THE REPORTED CAPTURE ON 20 OCT OF SEVERAL EGYPTIANS AMONG ALGERIANS
ABOARD A HELICOPTER FORCED DOWN IN EASTERN MOROCCO WILL REINFORCE
MOROCCAN CHARGES OF EGYPTIAN INVOLVEMENT. EARLIER, MOROCCO HAD
CAPTURED ONE EGYPTIAN OFFICER AND FOUND AN EGYPTIAN BODY AMONG
ALGERIAN CASUALTIES. NASIR SEEMS TOO ENGROSSED WITH HIS
AND HIS INTERNAL PROBLEMS TO GIVE ALGERIA MUCH EFFECTIVE SUPPORT,
AND HAS HITHERTO SHOWN A PREFERENCE FOR LIMITED AND NON-ATTRIBUTABLE
AID.
MOROCCO HAS SENT EMISSARIES TO MADRID AND PARIS TO RE-
QUEST MORAL, DIPLOMATIC AND MATERIAL SUPPORT. THE SPANISH GOVERN-
MENT WOULD PREFER TO ACT IN CONCERT WITH FRANCE AND OTHER WESTERN
COUNTRIES. PRESIDENT ELUNOZ GRANDES, HOWEVER, SEEMS WILLING TO
DIRECTOR

A US OFFICER NEXT SPAIN WOULD BE FORCED TO INTERVENE IN THE DISPUTE
AND EGYPT WOULD ENTER THE CONFLICT ON THE ALGERIAN SIDE BY SUPPLYING
ARMS OR OTHER MEANS. SPAIN'S POSITION IS COMPLICATED BY THE
FACT THAT NEGOTIATIONS HAD BEEN DIRECTED TO SPAIN FAIRLY SOON.
MOROCCO'S CLAIMS TO VARIOUS SPANISH-HELD TERRITORIES. THE SPANISH
RESPONSE IS NOT YET KNOWN.
BEN BELLA, HAVING AGAIN POSTPONED HIS VISIT TO THE
US, HAS SENT MOHAMED TAZID, HIS REPRESENTATIVE IN RECENT FRUITLESS
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE MOROCCANS, TO LINE UP SUPPORT AMONG AFRICAN
COUNTRIES' OFFICIALS IN NEW YORK. BOTH MOROCCO AND ALGERIA HAVE
INDICATED, HOWEVER, THAT THEY DO NOT WANT INTERVENTION AT THIS
TIME.
BOTH ALGERIA AND MOROCCO ARE ENCOURAGING THE CONTINUATION
OF MEDIATION EFFORTS (ALTHOUGH REPRESENTATIVES OF BOTH HAVE TOLD THE
UN SECRETARY GENERAL THAT THERE IS NO CHANCE OF A CEASE-FIRE AS
LONG AS THE OTHER DISPUTED AFRICAN UNITY BECAUSE OF ITS OPPOSITION
TO LEADER CHANGE. MOROCCO STILL PREFERENCES BILATERAL DISCUSSIONS
WITH ALGERIA.
14-00000
MOROCCO HAS GIVEN INDIRECT OR CLAR PROPAGANDA SUPPORT
TO ALGERIA. AN AUTHORITATIVE PRAVDA COMMENTATION
SAID IT WAS THE MOROCCANS WHO HAD INITIATED THE FIGHT AND THAT WHILE
IT IS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE FOR A FAIR AND PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF
THE CONFLICT, "IT IS NECESSARY TO FIND THE ALGERIAN PEOPLE TO
THEIR NATIONAL GAIN."
KING HASSAN'S INTERNAL POSITION HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT STRENGTHENED
BY THE CRISIS, HIS POSITION REMAINS, HOWEVER, SOMEWHAT VULNERABLE, HOWEVER,
SHOULD THE CURRENT VIEW ALGERIA ESCALATE INTO A PROLONGED CONFLICT
IN WHICH THE KING RELIED HEAVILY ON THE WEST WHILE ALGERIA WAS
SUPPORTED BY CERTAIN ARAB STATES.
THE ALGERIAN GOVERNMENT IS SPARING NO EFFORT TO WHIP UP NATIONAL
FEELING AGAINST MOROCCO AND HASSAN'S "OUTDATED REGIME." AT THE SAME
TIME, THE DISSIDENTS IN THE KABYLIE ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF AL-
GERS' DISCOMFORT WITH MOROCCO TO ENGAGE IN GUERRILLA OPERATIONS.
ON 16 OCT THREE GENERALS WERE KILLED AND ANOTHER SERIOUSLY INJURED IN A PLANE
CRASH 30 MILES EAST OF ALGIERS. (CONT.)
