PLEASE SEE PARA 6.
IN SUPPORT OF<JFK ASSASSINATION>REVIEW BOARD EFFORTS,
STATION IS WILLING TO ATTEMPT RECONTACT OF LITAMI-L/9 (T/9) ΤΟ ΟΒΤΑΙΝ
INFORMATION REQUESTED REF A. HOWEVER, PLEASE NOTE THAT, ASSUMING REF
B PARA 3 IS IDENTICAL TO T/9, HE IS AGING AND POSSIBLY EVEN
BEDRIDDEN. THE ONLY FEASIBLE LOCATION FOR RECONTACT WILL BE HIS
HOME, WHERE HE APPARENTLY LIVES WITH THE FEMALE WHO ANSWERED THE
PHONE DURING 26 MAR 98 PRETEXT CALL, AND WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT WE
WILL BE ABLE TO MEET ALONE WITH HIM.
3.
IN ADDITION, STATION BELIEVES THAT TO THOROUGHLY ANSWER ALL
OF REF A QUESTIONS, THE OFFICER CONDUCTING THE RECONTACT SHOULD
IDENTIFY HIMSELF AS A USG EMPLOYEE AND EXPLAIN THE VERY REAL
POSSIBILITY THAT (T/9'S NAME WILL BE EXPOSED IN AN UPCOMING
*DECLASSIFICATION OF DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE<JFK ASSASSINATION.>
ASSUMING THAT TOROCKAWAY COMMITTED ITSELF TO KEEPING (T/9'S NAME AND
TOROCKAWAY RELATIONSHIP SECRET, WE BELIEVE THAT THE LEAST WE CAN DO
IS ALLOW (1/9 TO PREPARE FOR POSSIBLE RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC BY
ENGAGING IN A FRANK EXCHANGE ON CURRENT REVIEW BOARD PROCEEDINGS.
WHILE POSSIBLY UPSETTING TO (T/97 SUCH A DISCUSSION WOULD BEST ALLOW
US TO DETERMINE ANY NEGATIVE RÉPERCUSSIONS ON 1/9 HIS FAMILY, HIS
(PENSION AND COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES, POSSIBLY RESULTING FROM
EXPOSURE.
4.
ALTHOUGH STATION DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION
TO RESPOND TO REF A QUESTIONS, WE SUSPECT THAT THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT/
DOES NOT PROVIDE (PENSIONS TO EXPATRIATES. EVEN IF THIS WERE THE
SECRET

CASE, STATION OFFICERS WHO HAVE SERVED IN HAVANA SEEM TO RECALL THAT
THE STANDARD CUBAN PENSION IS CURRENTLY WORTH LITTLE MORE THAN
SEVERAL DOLLARS PER MONTH. THEREFORE, ANY SEVERING OF (T/9'S CUBAN
PENSION WOULD NOT LIKELY HARM HIS FINANCIAL POSITION.
5. PER REF A QUERY REGARDING EFFECT OF THE EXPOSURE ON OTHER
STATION OPERATIONS, WE DO NOT LOOK FORWARD TO EXPLAINING TO ASSETS
CURRENTLY ON THE BOOKS WHY THE NAME OF A FORMER AND STILL
LIVING-TOROCKAWAY ASSET WAS OFFICIALLY DECLASSIFIED BY THE USG, WHEN
MERE DECLASSIFICATION OF INFORMATION ON ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN BY THAT
ASSET ON TOROCKAWAY'S BEHALF WOULD PERHAPS HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT.
WE
UNDERSTAND THAT HOS IS SEARCHING FOR ADDITIONAL T/9-SPECIFIC
INFORMATION ON WHICH TO BASE AN ARGUMENT AGAINST DECLASSIFICATION OF
TOS IDENTITY AND WE HOPE TO ASSIST IN THAT ENDEAVORSHOWEVER, ON A
BROADER SCALE, IF (T/9S IDENTITY AND ROLE WERE TO PROMINENTLY APPEAR
IN THE MEXICAN PRESS SUBSEQUENTLY TO DECLASSIFICATION, AT THE LEAST
WE WOULD EXPECT A MODERATE EROSION IN OUR ASSETS' CONFIDENCE THAT
TOROCKAWAY IS ABLE TO PROTECT THEIR IDENTITIES. AS WE EXPECT OUR
ASSETS TO ΜΑΙΝΤΑΙΝ THE-CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE RELATIONSHIP FROM THEIR
SIDE OF THE EQUATION AND HAVE OFTEN MADE THIS A MATTER OF CONTENTION
WITH ASSETS SOME AGENT HANDLING PROBLEMS COULD ENSUE WERE WE TO
APPEAR LESS THAN COMMITTED TO FULL PROTECTION OF THEIR IDENTITIES.
FUTURE AGENT ACQUISITIONS COULD ALSO BE COMPLICATED BY THE
DECLASSIFICATION OF T/9'S NAME, AS C/O'S WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO WORK
THAT MUCH HARDER TO CONVINCE MEXICANS THAT WE CAN PROTECT THEIR
IDENTITY FROM THE TYPICALLY ANTI-AMERICAN-LOCAL-PRESS.
6.
REQUEST HOS COMMENT REGARDING NEED FOR RECONTACT OFT/9 AND
REQUEST FILE REVIEW SO THAT WE WILL BE IN A FIRM POSITION FROM WHICH
TO ENGAGELT/9) ALTHOUGH (T/9 MAY NOT RECALL DETAILS OF ANY RECONTACT
PLAN) AFTER THE CONSIDERABLE TIME ELAPSED SINCE WORKING AS AN AGENT,
PLEASE PROVIDE ANY DETAILS (I.E. CALIAS OF LAST HANDLING C/O WHICH
COULD SERVE AS BONA FIDES. FINALLY, REQUEST HOS PROVIDE EXPLANATION
*OF EXACTLY HOW 1/9 IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE<JFK ASSASSINATION>AST/9 IS
SURE TO PUT THIS QUESTION TO OUR OFFICER.
