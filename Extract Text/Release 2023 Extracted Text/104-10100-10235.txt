OF SIEGE, GOULART TURNED TO HIS LEFTIST BROTHER-IN-LAW LEONEL BRIZOLA
POR ADVICE, ACCORDING TO A USUALLY RELIABLE CLANDESTINE SOURCE. THEY
ZEPORTKILY AGREED THAT GOULART SHOULD TREAT TΗΕΥΣΗΙΚΚΗ APPRALS FOR
VITHDRAWAL FROM VARIOUS GOVERNORS, MAYORS, AND STUDENT AND TEACHERS'
UNIONS AS A "VOTE OF CONFIDENCE" AND THAT GOULART SHOULD CONCENTRATE
ON REGAINING THE SUPPORT OF THE "POPULAR FORCES"

ALERADY BULICLY PROCLAIMED GOULART'S ACTION AS A "VICTORY FOR THE
PROGERBSIVE FORCES."

CABINET, SAID THAT WHILE PLEASED WITH THE & WITHDRAWAL OF THE STATE OF

SIDENCE IN THE VIABILITY OF THE LEXXEXX INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE
COUNTRY. HE BELIEVES IT HAS LAID THE BASIS FOR FURTHER POLARIZATION OF
POLITICAL OPINION
DANTAS THINKS THAT THE PRINCIPAL REASON GOULART WITHDREW THE
REQUEST WAS THE MASSIVE OPPOSITION FROM THE "SO-CALLED POPULAR FORCES,"
BY WHICH HER KANT LEFTIST EXTERNISTS, WHO PROBABLY FELT THAT THE STATE
OF SIEGE MIGHT BE USED TO TAKK ACTION AGAINST THEN.
