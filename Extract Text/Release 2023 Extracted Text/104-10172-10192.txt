Anatoliy Mikhaylovich GOLITSYN
Born 25.8.1926.
Defected in Finland 15.12.1961.
GOLITSYN defected during source's period of service with
the K.G.B. Source heard about him from various K.G.B. officers
but never met him.
2.
With regard to GOLITSYN's defection, source said he had
been told in Londen by both Konstantin Ivanovich 20TOV head of 4.
K.G.B. Branch 2.Counter-intelligence) there, and Sergey Mik-/
haylovich CLUSE the K.G.B. officer responsible for the S.K.,
that GOLITSYN, whose job in Finland source described as "Branch
2 of something", had clashed violently with his Resident in
Helsinki. He wrote a number of official and private letters to
Moscow asking that either he or the Resident be transferred.
Headquarters refused to agree this, and when he visited Moscow
threatened that if he failed to get on with the Resident he
would be in danger of losing his job. This was too much for
GOLITSYN, so he defected. Source added that this reason for
GOLITSYN's defection was convincing, and that he had never
heard any rumour that it was not genuine.
3. Source gave the following information about the measures
taken by the K.G.8. as the result of GOLITSYN's defection:
(a) He had been sentenced to death; this was stated in
an article in "The Chekist" which appeared some time after
1964. The K.G.B. would try to kill him as soon as they
could find hia.
(b) Within six weeks of GOLUBEV's arrival in London on
12.6.71. he told source that he had received a telegram.
from Headquarters ordering him to concentrate on obtaining
information about GOLITSYN, (to whom the K.G.B. had given
the abusive nickname UROD), because according to their
information GOLITSYN had visited England several times,
and while they had now established "the place of residence"
they had no approach to him. Moscow required detailed
information about where he was living, his habits and
activities. From the wording of this telegram source
deduced that GOLITSY was not resident in England, and
that the object of this order was to remind GOLUBEV of a
standing instruction that the highest priority was to be
given to obtaining information about him.
