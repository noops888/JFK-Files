Pertinent to SSC letter of January 9, 1976, CI Staff
has the following comments to make:
Item 1 The persons involved in the preparation of
DIR 86054 appear on the outgoing message.
Item 2 As close as we can determine the diplomat
referred to was an Italian. How he transmitted the information
to CIA is not reflected in the Oswald files. Therefore we
cannot provide or furnish copies of all messages, memoranda,
or other documents which evidence transmittal of the information
to CIA.
Item 3 We cannot find in the Oswald 201 any response
or followup to DIR 86054.
Item 4 Defer to LA Division for response.
Item 5 CI Staff cannot competently reply to the question
raised. We can only limit our response to what is contained in
the Oswald 201.
Item 6
Defer to LA Division.
