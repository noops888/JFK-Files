SUBJECT: Howard Hunt Examination
Attached is an index to the subjects covered in the
examination of Howard Hunt that Howard Liebengood and I con-
ducted last weekend.
On the basis of this examination, it appeared to both
Howard and me that there was no need to bring Hunt to Washington
for any further questioning. Please let me have any thoughts
you may have on another examination of Hunt. The present plan
is simply to arrange for him to swear to the transcript in
affidavit form.
