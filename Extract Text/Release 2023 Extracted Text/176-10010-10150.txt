MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. McGeorge Bundy
SUBJECT
: Intention of Cuban Exile Student Organization
(DRE) to Send Letter to President Kennedy
1. Confirming the advice given you on 8 December, it
has been reported to us by a reliable penetration source
within the organization that the Cuban exile student organi-
zation, DRE (Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil), with
headquarters in Miami, has drafted a letter for President
Kennedy. The gist of this letter is that the DRE, while
recognizing the U. S. Government's problems and difficulties
with respect to the Cuban situation, still expects President
Kennedy to "fullfil his promises to liberate Cuba."
2. The DRE leaders plan to give the letter to their
regular CIA contact officer on 12 December for transmittal
to the President. Subsequently, if steps are not taken by
the United States Government to carry out this pledge, the
DRE "will act." The report does not state specifically what
action is contemplated by the DRE, but we assume that it
would involve a resumption of commando raids and harrassment
tactics against Cuba.
3. On 13 December the DRE plans to release this letter
to the press and on the same date will attempt to stimulate
maximum propaganda support in Latin America for the DRE position.
Preparatory to this attempt, the DRE will send special
emissaries to Costa Rica, Mexico, and other Latin American
countries. If the campaign results in substantial support
for the DRE position, the organization would prepare to
initiate "action against Cuba" subsequent to 17 December.
In addition to the foregoing, the DRE is considering broading
its base and developing into a political movement, provided
it can obtain appropriate support in Latin America.
4. We have instructed the source of this report, who
is a confidant of the DRE leaders and, in fact, has been asked
by them to head the projected political movement, to attempt
to dissuade the DRE from taking this precipitous action which
could harm the cause of Cuban liberation. We have not as yet

been advised of the results of our source's efforts in this
regard.
::
5. If the DRE leadership goes through with its plan to
present this letter to its CIA contact officer on 12 December,
the officer will make every effort to dissuade the DRE
leadership from thus attempting to pressure the United States
Government.
6. We will keep you apprised of any important developments
in this matter.
