1. AT A MEETING ON 27 SEPTEMBER 1963 ALIAS FLEMING NOTED
SUBJECT'S ARREST AND STATED THAT HE AND HIS CATIDE COLLEAGUES HAD
WONDERED WHETHER AELADLE HAD PROVIDED THE LEAD. I HE WENT ON TO
STATE THAT AELADLE'S BONA FIDES WAS STILL A MATTER OF CONJECTURE
WITH CATIDE AND THAT CONFIRMATION OF HIS ROLE. IN SUBJECT'S
ARREST WOULD DISPERSE THESE DOUBTS AND LEAD TO A RE-EVALUATION OF
THE AELADLE INFORMATION IN CATIDE'S POSSESSION.
01
2. REFERENCE GAVE PERMISSION TO INDICATE KNOWLEDGE OF
SUBJECT'S CASE BUT DID NOT SPECIFICALLY STATE THAT WE COULD
REVEAL AELADLE'S ROLE. PLEASE ADVISE IF WE MAY CONFIRM TO ALIAS
FLEMING THAT AELADLE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR SUBJECT'S ARREST.
