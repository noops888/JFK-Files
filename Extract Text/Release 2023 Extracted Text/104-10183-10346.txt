8. It is requested that Ground Brauch of SOD moke
the services of Colonel
available for a one-day
orientation in the latest techniques used in the field of
counterinsurgency. The trainees are well avare of the
general problems and history of fighting guerrillas and
are actively engaged in oporations at the present. It is
suggested that the instructions stress use of intelligence
in combatting guerrilla groups and ceana of procuring it
to include the creation of intelligence nets acang peasants
in the afflicted areas. It is also belioved that any
current information on modifications in the tactics of
Mao Tse-tung would also: be of value as would be examples
of the use of psychological warfare programs against tho
guerrillas and the intellectual leaders of the commualet
party, considered as the novlug force behind the guerrilla
movonent in Venezuelajilit is proposed that Mr. Cavan
who would use the alias of "ill Cabal", fake the
to the office of
And that

as a member of the
counterinsurgency probl
International lolice Services Academy, has talked to other
Latin American officials on this problem as part of his
overt duties. It is believed his talks will make/SILA
more aware of the threats of insurgency movements and ated
Lo the ground work for possible future association with
SIFA or the Venez
field. Through Mr. Ellio. Chief of the Ground Branch of
SOO, and Mr. Wall, of the same branch, one-half day
orientation course was given to the first trainees who
suggested that a full day vould be sufficient due to the
lovel of the above trainees and the experience they have
in this fiold.
9. Arrangemente have been made with Mr. Luria and
Mr. Fritz Поkoof TSD/Training to provido
with a Flans and Souls course for the
period of 19-30 April at a TSD Safe House. It is believed
the Flure and Seals course will benefit CIA because it
will offor HERSCHOOL the opportunity to maintain closer
contact with 1ο111 το κοsponsible for this type
activity in SIAL SIFA proposes to make a concertod
offort in the letter intercept fiold to koop botter
informed of the extrece loftist offorts to overthrow the
| Venezuelan government, and it is felt that HUILSCHWOOD
can keep abreast of the operation. Because of SIFA'8
responsibilities it is believed that the wore effiofent
effort that SIFcan gule in this field will result to
the benefit of CIA.injor
would take the first six
_se then devote the last
woohs of the covert traini
two weeks to the Flops and Souls course.
10. It is also requested that TSO/Training provide
a one-day course in Audic Surveillance and flaps and
Seals for the other three trainees at the R & S Building.
This should be a very geuoral briefing with the least
possible omphasis on ocupiicated, expensive equipaout
that might be later requested by the trainces. It 10
believed this general introduction will give the IFA
trainees some idea as to approaches and problema luvolved
in these fields as well as the pitfalls that should be
avoided. This one-day course was given to the first three
tratuses who appeared improused with the concepte expoand
to thea. This subject has also been discussed with Mr.
Luria ami a fira date has been selected for the training.
The OTit fustructor will accompany the trainees and act
as translator.
It is roquested that C1/CA obtalo permission
for the visitors to enter the it & S building for this
training which is scheduled for the 19th of April.
