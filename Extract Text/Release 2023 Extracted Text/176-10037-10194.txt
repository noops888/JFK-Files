March 11, 1964
Mrs. Kennedy had originally expected to put out newe quietly
here that she had politely declined King's offer of house in Marrakech.
While still anxious that this be put on public record, she now
prefers that it be done from Moroccan end. So hope you can suggest
it come from Moroccans themselves. If this can't be arranged, we'd
appreciate it if you could background press in low key yourself.
Mrs. Kennedy asks that we express her apologies about putting you to
all this bother.
Theme of any release might be simply that Mrs. Kennedy most
grateful for King's gift. She has written King personally expressing this
but regretfully declining for personal reasons, particularly that educating
and raising her children in US will leave her all too little time make
proper use of such a house in Marrakech.
