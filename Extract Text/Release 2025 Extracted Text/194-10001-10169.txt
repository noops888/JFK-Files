Investigation requested by Comdr, Eglin AFB, FL on 7 Jul 69, to determine circum-
stances surrounding importation of 3 boxes of captured enemy weapons by SUBJECT.
Two boxes containing a total of 21 weapons, 5 noise suppressors, and related equip-
ment seized. Both boxes marked for SUBJECT. Munitions officials advised boxes
were stored at request of SUBJECT. Deputy Comdr, AFATL, advised his agency was
queried by ARPA, a DOD agency, about a box of weapons being sent through ARPA
channels. Investigation disclosed SUBJECT sent 12 weapons to Eglin AFB from SEA
while TDY in RVN in Nov 68. Eleven of these weapons were subsequently shipped from
Eglin AFB to Sionics, Atlanta, at SUBJECT's request and at government expense. The
twelfth weapon recovered at Eglin AFB. Deputy Comdr, AFATL, advised SUBJECT had no
known authority to send weapons from SEA nor to ship weapons to Sionics; Sionics
does not have AF contract. Records reflect SUBJECT, since Nov 68, has placed 7
long distance telephone calls to Sionics, at government expense. In verbal state-
ment, SUBJECT advised he shipped one box containing 12 captured enemy weapons from
SEA in approximately Nov 68 as part of his assigned duties to assist Vice-President
of Sionics; that ll of the weapons were subsequently forwarded to Sionics in Mar
69, because he considered Sionics an AF contractor. He advised that official
telephone calls were placed for same reason. SUBJECT stated he acted as an agent
for the USAF in all instances. He declined to execute a written statement at this
time. SUBJECT's former supervisor in SEA advised that he did not authorize or di-
rect the shipment of any captured enemy weapons to Sionics. Matter coordinated
with U. S. Treasury agents who opined that SUBJECT was in violation of Public Law
90-618.

DETAILS
1. This investigation was requested by the Commander, Eglin
AFB, Florida on 7 July 1969, based on a request from the
Commander, Air Force Armament Laboratory (AFATL), Eglin AFB,
to determine the circumstances surrounding the importation of
three boxes of captured enemy weapons by PAUL ARNOLD MARRIOTT
(SUBJECT), Lt Col, 513-10-4236FR, AFATL, during the approxi-
mate period of November 1968 - July 1969
2.
On 7 July 1969, at Eglin AFB, Florida, a letter dated 3
July 1969, from the Commander, AFATL, was reviewed and the body
of the letter is set forth as follows:
"1. It is requested that an investigation be conducted to de-
termine if the laws/regulations regarding the importation of
firearms have been complied with in the following instance.
"a. Approximately the first week in June Mr Beard of ARPA
called Colonel Berkow of ADTC and inquired about a box of enemy
weapons that had been shipped through the transportation capa-
bilities of ARPA to Eglin AFB, Attention of Lt Colonel P. A.
Marriott. Colonel Berkow called the Armament Laboratory (AFATL)
since Lt Colonel Marriott is assigned to AFATL.
"b
A search was made to locate the shipment. Two boxes
were found each containing North Vietnamese weapons. Both
boxes were addressed as follows: FB2823 USAF (DOL-AFSC) Attn
L/CP. A. Marriott.
"c. Subsequently, it was discovered that a shipment of
North Vietnamese weapons and ammunition had been received at
Eglin in early March and had been reshipped to Sionics
Corporation, 1655 Peachtree Street, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia.
attached documents pertain to this shipment.
"2
The
Colonel J. H. Hobaugh, telephone 882-2763, will be available
to discuss in more detail the above information.".
The above letter is being retained in the files of OSI District
7 and will be available to proper authority upon request.
3. On 9 July 1969, J. T. KING, Lt Col, 472-12-2614FR, Staff
Judge Advocate, 3201st Air Base Group, Eglin AFB, Florida, was
apprised of the information contained in the above letter, by
SA WILLIAM D. DIXΟΝ. KING advised that in his opinion, there
existed probable cause to warrant the issuance by the Base Com-
mander of an authorization for search and seizure of any captured
enemy weapons contained in the storage facilities of the 3207th
Armament and Munitions Test Support Squadron (AMTS), Eglin AFB.

KING also opined that there was probably a violation of Public
Law 90-618 (Gun Control Act of 1968), possibly a violation of
customs regulations, and possibly a fraud in that government
transportation facilities had been misused.
4.
On 9 July 1969, DONALD V. THOMPSON, Colonel, 472-12-2614FR,
Deputy Commander, 3201st Air Base Group, Eglin AFB, Florida, was
briefed concerning this matter, by SA DIXON. Colonel THOMPSON
subsequently executed an Authority to Search and Seize, thereby
authorizing the seizure of any captured enemy weapons contained
in the storage facilities of the 3207th AMTS.
5. On 9 July 1969, a search of the storage facilities of the
3207th AMTS, Building 1270, Eglin AFB, Florida, was conducted by
SA DIXON, in presence of JOSIAH C. MUSICK, CMSgt, FR361-07-1904,
and CLARENCE M. GREEN, SMSgt, FR250-44-2188, NCOIC and Assistant
NCOIC, respectively. The search revealed the presence of two
packing crates marked for SUBJECT containing a total of 21 various
automatic weapons, five noise suppressors, two range finders, 32
ammunition magazines and a brass plaque mounted on a piece of wood.
The crates and contents were seized and taken as evidence against
proper receipt and are being held by the evidence custodian of OSI
Detachment 710, Eglin AFB, Florida, and are available to proper
authority upon request
6.
On 11 July 1969, this investigation was coordinated with
WILLIAM C. GOODMAN, SSAN: 579-20-9774, and ROBERT E. SANDERS,
SSAN: 150-26-6417, Special Investigators, Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms Control Division, Internal Revenue Service (Treasury
Department), Pensacola, Florida, at Eglin AFB, Florida. GOODMAN
advised that based on the available information, it appears that
SUBJECT is in violation of Public Law 90-618; however, he would
query his headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia and Washington, D. C.
in an attempt to ascertain if SUBJECT had applied for permission
to import the weapons or had submitted application to register
the weapons. GOODMAN added that his inquiry would be accomplished
by the most expeditious means available. GOODMAN and SANDERS re-
quested that they be present during the photographing and identi-
fication of the weapons and during all interviews of witnesses and
SUBJECT during this investigation.
7. On 11 July 1969, at Eglin AFB, Florida, the weapons were
photographed in the presence of the writer, SA DIXON, GOODMAN and
SANDERS, by CARL (NMI) CASSULO, SSgt, FR122-14-3910, Photographic
Laboratory, Eglin AFB. The weapons are further identified as

8. On 14 July 1969, JOHN H. HOBAUGH, Colonel, 165-05-2634FR,
Deputy Commander, AFATL, Eglin AFB, Florida, was interviewed at
his duty station by GOODMAN and the writer. Colonel HOBAUGH
advised substantially as follows: The first part of June 1969,
he received a telephone call from Colonel BERKOW of the
Armament Development and Test Center (ADTC), Eglin AFB.
Colonel
BERKOW stated that he had received a call from a Mr. BEARD (NFI)
of the Advance Research Project Agency (ARPA), a DOD agency, who
inquired about a box of enemy weapons that had been shipped
through the transportation capabilities of ARPA to Eglin AFB, to
the attention of Lt Col P. A. MARRIOTT. At this time Colonel
HOBAUGH attempted to contact SUBJECT, but was unable to do so as
SUBJECT was on leave; however, he left a message for SUBJECT to
call him the next day. The next day SUBJECT called Colonel
HOBAUGH and was instructed to telephonically contact Mr. BEARD
and explain to BEARD the circumstances surrounding the shipping
of the enemy weapons. At this time Colonel HOBAUGH went on
leave, returning about 1 July 1969. Upon his return to duty,
Colonel HOBAUGH was asked by Colonel MARTIN, Commander, AFATL, to
look into the circumstances surrounding the shipment of enemy
weapons and ammunition to Sionics from Eglin AFB, Florida and at
the same time showing Colonel HOBAUGH a shipping document, dated
13 March 1969, requesting the shipment of two boxes of miscel-
laneous equipment to Sionics, 1655 Peachtree Street, NE, Atlanta,
Georgia 30309, Attn: Mr. FRED BROWN, signed by SUBJECT. Colonel
HOBAUGH fürther stated that the boxes of so called miscellaneous
equipment were found to contain weapons and ammunition and were
therefore repacked and shipped by the organizational logistics
personnel according to their instructions from SUBJECT.

Colonel HOBAUGH advised that SUBJECT made several conflicting
statements concerning his knowledge of how the enemy weapons
got into the U.S. from the Republic of Vietnam (RVN). SUBJECT
stated that he thought the weapons were registered by Sionics;
SUBJECT stated that he thought the weapons were for the
museum at Eglin AFB; and SUBJECT denied any knowledge of how
any of the boxes of enemy weapons were sent to Eglin AFB.
SUBJECT stated to Colonel HOBAUGH that while assigned to 7th
Air Force in RVN, he acted as escort officer for MITCHELL
WER BELL III, Vice-President of Sionics, and during such duties
introduced WER BELL to several agencies. Colonel HOBAUGH also
recalled that SUBJECT had stated that WER BELL was in RVN under
Air Force sponsorship and was a close friend of the Thai Chief
of Staff. Colonel HOBAUGH recalled that Colonel BILL FAGAN was
SUBJECT'S supervisor in RVN. Colonel HOBAUGH stated that to the
best of his knowledge the Air Force museum at Eglin AFB has only
a few old Viet Cong weapons as the museum was appointed to dis-
play weapons of U.S. origin and the Air Force Laboratory has no
test program for enemy weapons. Furthermore, no need exists for
enemy weapons at Eglin AFB. Colonel HOBAUGH stated that it is
not likely that SUBJECT had any authority to ship any enemy
weapons from RVN, and SUBJECT unequivocally had no authority to
ship any weapons to Sionics as the Air Force Laboratory at Eglin
AFB presently has no contract with Sionics, nor has it ever had
a contract with Sionics for any purpose.

a copy of a GBL, Nr F-0,648,922, dated 28 March 1969, with an
attached DD Form 1149 (REQUISITION AND INVOICE/SHIPPING DOCUMENT)
dated 13 March 1969, Requisition Nr FB2823 9073X100XXX, both of
which he furnished to the writer. A review of these documents

Eglin AFB, Florida, and advised as follows: On 13 March 1969,
Sgt ARNOLD of his office advised him that there were two boxes
of small arms and ammunition in the logistics storage facility
for SUBJECT. COOLEY stated that he advised SUBJECT that the
arms and ammunition could not be shipped without authorization.
SUBJECT therefore requested by letter dated 13 March 1969 that
the arms and ammunition be shipped as miscellaneous equipment
to Sionics, 1655 Peachtree Street, Atlanta, Georgia 30309, Attn:
Mr. FRED BROWN. COOLEY therefore made the arrangements for the
shipment and the DD Form 1149, Nr FB2823 9073 X100XXX was exe-
cuted. A file containing the following documents was furnished
to the writer by COOLEY:
a.
Original letter dated 13 March 1969, signed by SUBJECT,
requesting Mr. COOLEY to ship two boxes of miscellaneous equip-
ment to Sionics.
b. Form letter dated 8 April 1969, to Sionics advising

writer the AF Forms 1072 (AUTHORIZED LONG DISTANCE TELEPHONE
CALLS) for the period from 1 December 1968 to date. A review
of these forms disclosed that SUBJECT placed seven long
distance telephone calls to either Mr. FRED BROWN or Sionics
at telephone numbers 404-873-3672, 404-873-3673, and 404-366-

SUBJECT personally placed a long distance telephone call to
Sionics in approximately December 1968.
15. On 16 July 1969, PAUL (NMN) ARNOLD, SSgt, FR489-38-5452,
Logistics Office, AFATL, Eglin AFB, Florida, was interviewed at
his duty station and advised substantially as follows: On 13
March 1969, SUBJECT informed him that there were two boxes in
the AFATL storage facility that had to be shipped out. ARNOLD
subsequently went to the storage facility with SUBJECT and Capt
JERRY MCEWEN where the two boxes were opened and were found to
contain weapons and ammunition. Among the weapons there was
one that had apparently been damaged in combat and both SUBJECT
and McEWEN expressed a great deal of interest in the weapon.
ARNOLD stated that he left the storage facility to proceed to
packing and crating to make arrangements for the shipment, and
SUBJECT and McEWEN were left alone in the facility with the
weapons. ARNOLD stated that he did not see either SUBJECT or
McEWEN remove a weapon from that area, but he felt that one or
the other took the weapon, therefore explaining why only 11
weapons were shipped to Sionics.
16. On 16 July 1969, JERALD B. MASSEY, Lt Col, 711-14-9602FR,
Commander, 3207th AMTS, advised at Eglin AFB, Florida that in
approximately February 1969, someone from SUBJECT's office
called him to ask if a box of arms could be stored for a few
days. He assented and the box was therefore stored in Building
1270 until seized by OSI on 9 July 1969.
17. On 16 July 1969, WARREN G. COOK, CMSgt, FR015-16-6519,
3207th AMTS, advised at Eglin AFB, Florida that on 6 July 1969,

instructed by COOK to proceed to transportation and pick up
the box of weapons, at which time the weapons were stored
in Building 1270 and remained there until seized by OSI on 9
July 1969.
18. On 17 July 1969, SUBJECT was interviewed by GOODMAN, supra,
and the writer at OSI Detachment 710, Eglin AFB, Florida. Prior
to the interview SUBJECT was advised of the nature of the in-
vestigation; of his rights under the provisions of Article 31,
UCMJ; of his right to remain silent; his right to have a lawyer
present during the interview; and that he could obtain a civilian
lawyer of his own choosing, at his own expense, or if he wished,
the Air Force would appoint a military lawyer for him free of
charge. SUBJECT advised that he wished to waive his rights and
made the following verbal statement:
In approximately November 1968, while assigned to 7th Air Force
Headquarters, RVN, as a munitions expert, he was ordered by his
OIC, Colonel FAGAN, to assist and support WER BELL, the Vice-
President of Sionics, to the fullest extent possible. Therefore,
when WER BELL asked SUBJECT to send a box of 12 captured weapons
to the U.S., SUBJECT complied by sending the weapons through
official channels to Eglin AFB, Florida, as he (SUBJECT) con-
sidered Sionics, and therefore WER BELL, an official Air Force
contractor. On approximately 13 March 1969, at SUBJECT's request,
11 of the 12 weapons sent to Eglin AFB by him were further sent
to Sionics, after FRED BROWN, President of Sionics, assured
SUBJECT that the weapons had been licensed and registered with the
proper authorities. The shipment was sent to Sionics through
official government transportation channels, at government expense.
SUBJECT also admitted placing approximately 7 long distance tele-
phone calls since November 1968 from his office at Eglin AFB,
Florida to Sionics or FRED BROWN in Atlanta, Georgia, at govern-
ment expense as he (SUBJECT) stated that Sionics is an Air Force
contractor. SUBJECT further stated that he had the twelfth
weapon that was sent to Eglin AFB from SEA in approximately
November 1968 stored in the lock-up room at Range 22, Eglin AFB.
SUBJECT also advised that during the approximate period of
February to June 1969, two additional boxes of captured enemy
weapons were sent to Eglin AFB, Florida (Attn: Lt Col P. A. MARRIOTT)
from Bangkok, Thailand, by (to the best of SUBJECT's knowledge)
WER BELL. SUBJECT then asked the appropriate personnel at Eglin
AFB to store the weapons for safekeeping and SUBJECT stated that if
the weapons were not sent to Sionics, he assumed the weapons would
be sent to the Air Force museum at Eglin AFB. SUBJECT further
stated that as the officer responsible for the Air Force museum,
