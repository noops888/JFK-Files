Book V. p. 79 In mid-1965 the CIA interrogated Tepedino,
New York jeweler who had been involved
with the AMLASH operation from the
beginning. The report concluded that
the subject was deceptive during the
interrogation and withheld pertinent
information in one or more relevant
areas. Tepedino lied in response to
questions dealing with AMLASH's and his
ties to Cuban intelligence. Tepedino
stated chat AMLASH had no plan to over-
throw Castro. Tepedino stated AMLASH
had strong connections with Cuban
intelligence and was probably cooperating
with it in various ways. Although
AMLASH never mentioned these connections
to his CIA case officers: Teledino
stated chat AMLASH had mentioned them
to him and almost everyone else he had
met.

Book V, p. 25 Helms cirected Karamessinis and Angleton
to fully cooperate with the desk officer,
John Whitten, charged with investigating
the assassination. On November 24,
Mexico City cabled the names of known
contacts of Soviet personnel in Mexico
City and AMLASH's name (Rolando Cubela)
was included on that list. Nonetheless
neither Fitzgerald, Helms, Tom K or
Angleton advised the desk officer of
significance of this name.
