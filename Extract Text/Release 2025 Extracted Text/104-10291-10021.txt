1. On 6 June 1952

to have the above-named subject's active
ing and experience, it was felt that the subject would be of more service
to the United States as an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency
than he would be as a member of the Armed Forces.
2. Should the subject resign or otherwise be separated from CIA,
please notify this office immediately in order that this cancellation
action may be revoked and the subject will be made a free agent,

strict security measures. I agree to honor the requests of CIA
relative to my epplication whether it be accepted or rejected. I

tion in CIA. If questioned directly, I will say that I have applied

answor will acknowledge that CIA is one of them but will attech no
particular significance to such application. I agree not to dis-
closo porsonnel procedures I have observed in CIA, I agree not to
discuss by name or otherwise, any individuals with whom I have
talked in the course of my application to CIA.
