Nikita Khrushchov and Fidel Castro
at the Likhachov Automobile Works,
which they visited the day before
May-1.
The workers of the plant were hold-
ing a social evening at their Palace of
Culture, and the distinguished guest
was greeted by thousands of people.
Both Nikita Khrushchov and Fidel
Castro were presented with models of
the ZIL car made at the Works. Before
the concert, Nikita Khrushchov, Fidel
Castro and his party saw a documen-
tary film about the Works, which was
the first Soviet automobile plant.
Famous performers and amateurs took
part in the concert, which wound up
thr the "July 26th March". The last
as were drowned in enthusiastic ap-
planse, and cries of "Viva Fidel!" and
"Viva Cuba!" resounded in the hall
long afterwards.

:
(S) (Gp-1) A Soviet Embassy official in Mexico City,
Nikolai S. LEONOV, is allegedly actively planning an insur-
gent movement in Latin America. LEONOV left Mexico for the
USSR on 21 April to confer with: KHRUSHCHEV and CASTRO.
Credence is given this report by the publication of a photo-
graph of the three on 8 May in a Cuban newspaper. The pho-
tograph was purportedly taken during a recent Leeting.
(S) (Gp-1) Cuba and Mexico, according to LEONOV's
schemes, would serve as bases for the insurgency. Cuba
would be the "invisible beachhead" and Mexico the point for
covert distribution of arms.
(S) (Gp-3) The individual selected as the contact man
for arms acquisition is said to have been engaged in simi-
lar activity in Guatemala about a year ago.
(S) (Gp-3) Another report from sources in Colombia
stated that pro-CASTRO ex-President CARDENAS planned to
call a meeting in Mexico City of "leftist bent", disgrun-
tled retired military officers from Latin American coun-
tries on the subject of insurgency. (DIA, 3 June 1963)
