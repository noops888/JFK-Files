As you are aware, James Angleton of CIA frequently turns
over to the Bureau on a highly confidential basis information which
has been developed through operations headed by Angleton. In many
instances the information is given to the Bureau without clearing
through regular CIA channels. In almost all instances it is given
to us with the clear understanding that if included in a report or
other communication prepared for dissemination outside the Bureau
the information will be so set forth that it cannot be traced back
to either Angleton or CIA. In such instances where the information
relates to Israeli Chatters, it has been the practice of Israeli (S)
supervisors to clear with Angleton before disseminating information
from him outside the Bureau.J1

In taking up such a matter with Angleton last week it
was determined that he objected to attributing information which
he had furnished to "Confidential Informant T-2, an Agency of the
Government which conducts personnel and intelligence investigations."
He pointed out that by describing T-2 as an agency of the Government
which conducts personnel and intelligence investigations the Bureau
was revealing to outside, agencies that the material did in fact
come from another Government agency. Since the material related
to an individual who now resides in Israel, Angleton stated that, (S)

in his opinion, recipient agencies could logically conclude that
the information had originated with CIA since such an individual
would be under CIA jurisdiction insofar as investigations abroad
are concerned. Angleton requested that the information merely
be attributed to Confidential Informant T-2, who, in this instance,
could be described as being of known reliability.
:
It is suggested that it would materially assist in the
handling of information received from Angleton in the future, if
the Liaison Section could work out a procedure whereby Angleton
might be referred to as a Bureau informant. This would permit the
Supervisors receiving the Angleton material firsthand to transmit
it to the field and advise the field that the information in any
report should be attributed to an informant with a temporary symbol
number, which informant could be evaluated as having furnished in-
formation of a reliable nature in the past. On the informant page
the temporary symbol number could be identified by the regular
Bureau symbol assigned to Angleton. (4)
