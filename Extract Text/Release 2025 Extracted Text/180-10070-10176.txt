Assassination Records Review Board
Final Determination Notification
AGENCY: HSCA
RECORD NUMBER : 180-10070-10176
RECORD SERIES : STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS
AGENCY FILE NUMBER :
December 8, 1995
Status of Document: Postponed in Part
Number of releases of previously postponed information: 12
Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors
including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the
absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.
Number of Postponements: 6
Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.
Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could
reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of
privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.
Substitute Language: SSN
Date of Next Review: 2017
Board Review Completed: 10/24/95

Richard Sprague
Select Committee on Assasinations
House Annex II
Washington, D.C.
Dear Mr. Sprague:
Gail Beagle suggested that I contact you concerning
employment possibilities with the Select Committee. I am
seeking a legal position on the Committee staff, and would
like very much to speak with you concerning those possibilities.
I am a Harvard Law School graduate and a member of the bar.
Before going to law school, I was an intern with Congressman
Gonzalez. In addition, I have graduate degrees and considerable
experience (including teaching at Harvard) in modern American
history, a facet which might be of interest to the Committee.
In Washington, a reference can be provided by former
Speaker Carl Albert, who knows me well. He would be happy
to respond to a request for information concerning my
abilities.
I shall be in Washington through Friday, and hope to
see you during that time if it is in any way possible.
Sincerely,
Paulkeunik
Paul Zevnik
