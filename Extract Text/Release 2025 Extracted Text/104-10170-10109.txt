2.
Background:
a On 8 January 1976, Mr. Richard D. Mahoney
requested a mandatory review of two classified CỦA
documents under provisions of Executive Order 11652
Section 5(C). The documents were in custody of
the National Archives and Records Service (NARS)
in the John F. Kennedy Library.
b. On 19 April 1976, the NARS referred Mr.
Mahoney's request with copies of the documents to
CIA. The Agency was asked to review the documents.
If declassified, they were to be marked appropriately.

If they remained classified, the Agency was
requested to cite the applicable exemption
category from Section 5(R) of the E.C. and
a date when automatic declassification may be
accomplished. They requested that the copies
of the documents be returned with the Agency's
response.
c. On 26 July 1976, IPS wrote to the
NARS and returned copies of the documents.
Both documents were found to require continued classt-
fication under 6.0. 11652 Section 5(B).

and was enclosed. NARS could advise requester
of his right to appeal directly to CIA.
However, a
d. On 15 August 1976, Mr. Mahoney wrote
to the CIA and appealed the decision to with-
hold from declassification Item #2 of his
request.
3.
Recommendations:
3. Tah B-2 contains TDCSDB 3/657,851 dated
12 November 1963. During the initial review, the
document was denied in toto to requester under
provision 5(R) (2) of E.O. 11652, as amended. The
document is based on ACL-1832 dated 10 November
1963. I recommend that the initial determination
to deny the document to the requester in toto
under provision 5(B)(2) of E.O. 11652, as amended,
be sustained and that provision S(B) (3) of E.Ο.
11652 now be applied. The information is from
a sensitive source with unique access to a poli-
tical leader. If released, the information could
cause embarrassment to the United States Govern-
ment and exacerbate relations with a friendly
foreign government.
b. During the DDO appeals review, a classifi-
cation review was conducted. The document is
properly classified and properly marked in accordance
with the provisions of E.O. 11652,
as amended.
Due to the sensitivity of the subject matter, a
meaningful sanitization cannot be made.

Backgromal:

a. Richard Doyle Mahon oney, a membe member of the the public
who is identified as a researcher, initiated on
8 January 1975 through the John F. Kennedy Library
a mandatory review of TDCSDB-5/656,740 98 accordance
with the provisions of E.O. 11652, Section 5(C).
The request for review was forwarded to IPS via the
National Archives and Records Service (NARS) on
10 May 1976.
b. IPS responded to HARS on 24 June 1976.
Among other things, CIA denied in toto TOCSDE-
3/656,740, which was Itea ga on the NARS request, ou
the ground of Section 5(B) (2) of E.O. 11652. The

reply stated that the document had to remain
Classified indefinitely in order to protect
intelligence sources and methods, and stated
that release of segregable portions was not
feasible. This was based upon a classification
review by a knowledgeable officer with experience
in French-African affairs, dated 24 May 1976.
c. Mr. Richard Doyle Mahoney appealed this
determination directly to IPS in a letter dated
22 September 1976. He specifically asked if
it would not be possible to release a sanitized
version of the document without jeopardizing
national security.
3. Recommendations:
a. See the Appeals Review Forms for specific
detailed recommendations.
b. A second classification review was requested
by DDO/ISS/PICG. The second review was conducted
on TDCSDB-3/656,740 on 22 December 1976 by Europe
Division, which decided to retain the classification
at Secret in accordance with E.O. 11652. Europe
Division determined after review that there were
foreign policy and liaison sensitivities which
precluded downgrading TDCSDB-3/656,740, or
sterilizing the document and releasing portions
thereof, at this time. Specifically the report
describes in a critical and subjective way various
French governmental entities and French personalities
living and dead. The knowledge by the current
French government that this particular information,
or general information of this same type, had been
circulated at high levels of the U.S. government
would be detrimental to current U.S./French foreign
relations. Further, one of the individuals
mentioned is a former French intelligence operative
and cabinet officer. Relations with the French
liaison services are presently reasonably good,
and disclosure of information of this sort would
undoubtedly have a detrimental effect on future U.S.
relations with French liaison services, as well as a
probable spill-over effect on U.S./French foreign
relations.

reply stated that the document had to remain
Classified indefinitely in order to protect
intelligence sources and methods, and stated
that release of segregable portions was not
feasible. This was based upon a classification
review by a knowledgeable officer with experience
in French-African affairs, dated 24 May 1976.
c. Mr. Richard Doyle Mahoney appealed this
determination directly to IPS in a letter dated
22 September 1976. He specifically asked if
it would not be possible to release a sanitized
version of the document without jeopardizing
national security.
3. Recommendations:
a. See the Appeals Review Forms for specific
detailed recommendations.
b. A second classification review was requested
by DDO/ISS/PICG. The second review was conducted
on TDCSDB-3/656,740 on 22 December 1976 by Europe
Division, which decided to retain the classification
at Secret in accordance with E.O. 11652. Europe
Division determined after review that there were
foreign policy and liaison sensitivities which
precluded downgrading TDCSDB-3/656,740, or
sterilizing the document and releasing portions
thereof, at this time. Specifically the report
describes in a critical and subjective way various
French governmental entities and French personalities
living and dead. The knowledge by the current
French government that this particular information,
or general information of this same type, had been
circulated at high levels of the U.S. government
would be detrimental to current U.S./French foreign
relations. Further, one of the individuals
mentioned is a former French intelligence operative
and cabinet officer. Relations with the French
liaison services are presently reasonably good,
and disclosure of information of this sort would
undoubtedly have a detrimental effect on future U.S.
relations with French liaison services, as well as a
probable spill-over effect on U.S./French foreign
relations.
