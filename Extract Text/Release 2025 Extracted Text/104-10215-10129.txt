and Support)
1. Reference is made to a memorandum dated 17 April 1958 from
WE Division through CI/OA requesting that the Covert Security Approval
granted on 3 July 1957 be amended to permit Subject's utilization as
a career agent in Mexico City under Project LIEDGE.
This will confirm the verbal Covert Security Approval granted
to Mr. Larry Sulc, WH Division on 3 June 1958 for the use described
above.
2. In accordance with the provisions set forth in Clandestine
Services Instruction No. 10-5 and Clandestine Services Instruction -
Field No. 10-5, a covert security approval is granted for the use of
the Subject, as described in your request as set forth in paragraph 1,
above.
3. Subjects of covert security approvals are not to represent
themselves as, nor are they to be represented as, employees of CIA.
4. Your attention is called to the fact that a covert security
approval does not constitute complete compliance with the provisions
of CIA Regulation 10-210. Therefore, if you should desire at a later
date to change the status or use of this individual, a request for
approval to cover any proposed change should be submitted to this
office.
:
5. This approval becomes invalid in the event the Subject
services are not utilized within six months of the date of this
memorandum.

Recommendations:
1. CT/CA recommis approval on condition the agent Harold R. FOENAYR receives, from
the Office of Security, a Covert Security Approval for his now osadgment in Mexico City and
the results of his LCFLUTTER are satisfactorily resolved. Also, on condition that should the
Office of Security requsse a clearance and LCPUFTER on this agent's wife, a clearance is
Leaved end LCFLUTTER results are catisfactorily resolved.
2. A new request for CBA for Subject's use in Mood.co City vas subaitted to the Office
of Security on 24 April 1958. When the Office of Becurity issued Subject's leat CSA on 3 July
1957, thay recomended that Subject be afforded a polygraph as soon as possible. Subjort s
given on LCFLUTTER a few days ago and although Subject ran clean the polygraph operator begra
getting some reaction, or hits, regarding the Subject's vifo. There is some derogatory infor
mation in the Office of Security on that is believed to be the Subject's wife and sister-in-
lev.
3. The Office of Security has not renched a final decision regarding CSA and LCFLUFEER
for Bubject's vifo. They have stated, however, that unless the wife can be clearod and
LCFLUFFER results are clean, it is doubtful whether a nov clearance vould be issued for the
career agent.

granted for the use of the Subject, as described in your request

4. Subjects of covert security clearances are not to represent
themselves as, nor are they to be represented as, employees of
CIA.

clearance does not constitute complete compliance with the
provisions of CIA Regulation 10-210. Therefore, if you should
desire at a later date to change the status or use of this
individual, a request for clearance to cover any proposed change
should be submitted to this office.

1. Concurrent with this memorandum a covert security
clearance is being issued to enable the Subject's conversion from
contract agent to career agent for use as principal agent for
Project AMPHARCH in Cuba under non-official cover.
2. This is to advise that information has been received
from a confidential source of the Office of Security concerning
Argentina CORDERO Calderon and her sister, Counsuelo, who are
believed to be the Subject's wife and sister-in-law respectively.
According to a December 1944 report, the above individuals were
described as Costa Rican citizens then in Panama under
suspicion and members of the Russian Ballet team of Pedro and
Lidia CHUPRINE. Argentina is known to speak and understand
German. She was formerly married to Pedro MARZAL, reportedly
a German national and formerly on both British and U. S.
Proclaimed List. She is reliably reported to have made pro-
German remarks and is pro-Gervan in her sympathies. It was
further reported that both of the above indivimals have at
times attempted. to secure information from members of the
American Armed Forces...
3. In view of the above information, it is requested that
current overseas traces and investigation be conducted on the
Subject as well as on his wife and sister-in-law, Counsuelo,
and other members of his wife's immediate family and that the
results thereof be furnished this office.
4. The covert security clearance which is being issued
in this case is made contingent upon the faovrable results of
the requested overseas traces and investigation.
