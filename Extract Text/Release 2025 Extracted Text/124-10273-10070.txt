On the basis of this information, we immediately instructed the
Washington Field and New York Offices to institute confidential inquiries with
appropriate Post Office officials to determine the feasibility of covering outgoing
correspondence from the U.S. to the (U.S.S.R.), looking toward picking up a
communication dispatched to the aforementioned address.
:
On January 21, 1958, SAC Powers of the New York Office called
advising that his preliminary inquiries at first disclosed that such coverage
could possibly be effected at LaGuardia Airfielă. Powers stated that he subsequently
received a call from the Chief Post Office Inspector who told him that he would not
be able to make such arrangements and explained that something had happened in
Washington on a similar matter and that Bureau Headquarters should take up the
matter with Post Office Headquarters here in Washington. The Post Office
Inspector said that it did not involve our agency and because of what was going
on in Washington at the present time, he just couldn't do it on his own.
Almost simultaneous with this advice, Mr. James Angleton of CIA
approached our Liaison Agent, (Sam Papich) on a personal basis. He indicated
that if it were known within CIA that he was volunteering this information to the
Bureau, he would lose his job. Mr. Angleton stated it had come to the attention
of CIA, through the Post Office, that we were making inquiries concerning the
coverage of mail to the U.S.S.R), and as a result CIA was expecting to receive
an inquiry in Washington from the FBI. Mr. Angleton then admitted that this
coverage was one of the biggest and most secret operations being conducted by
CIA. He stated the coverage is actual

MEMO TO: MR. BOARDMAN
RE: COVERAGE OF MAIL TO THE (U.S. (U.S.S.R.)
and in view of the volume of material being sent from the U.S., their coverage
is an extensive and expensive operation. He indicated that they had to set up an
elaborate array of IBM machines to tally and tabulate the results. In addition
a complicated indexing procedure was involved, as well as complex scientific
examinations of the material. He said two or three hundred CIA employees are
exclusively engaged on various facets of the coverage. Angleton also indicated
that the cost of the operation was well over a million dollars a year, He further
indicated that the coverage has been in existence in excess of a year and he
stated that the sole purpose for the coverage was to identify persons behind the
Iron Curtain who might have some ties in the U.S. and who could be approached
Jin their countries as contacts and sources for CIA. Angleton indicated that CIA
had successfully developed several sources through this means. He stressed
the confidential nature of his information and stated that while other officials of
CIA more directly concerned with the coverage were expecting a visit from the
FBI he was passing this along for our guidance.
It would appear that our inquiries of the Post Office officials in
New York have flushed out a most secret operation of CIA. The question
immediately arises as to whether CIA in effecting this coverage in New York
has invaded our jurisdiction. In this regard, it is believed that they have a
legitimate right in the objectives for which the coverage was set up, namely,
the development of contacts and sources of information behind the Iron Curtain,
and according to Angleton they have had some success: in this regard. At the
same time, there is an internal security objective here in which, because of
our responsibilities, we have a definite interest, namely, the identification of
illegal espionage agents who may be in the United States. While recognizing
this interest, it is not believed that the Bureau should assume this coverage
because of the inherent dangers in the sensitive nature of it, its complexity,
size and expense. It is believed that we can capitalize on this coverage by
pointing out to CIA our internal security objectives and holding them responsible
to share their coverage with us. Of course, we are not interested in the
identities of the numerous persons in this country legitimately corresponding
abroad. The Post Office has indicated there are approximately four thousand
items of correspondence to the U.S.S.R. each day. Angleton said they have not
come up with a microdot or secret message communication as yet.

CIA coverage of mail going to and coming from(Russia) Our Liaison Agent
determined that CIA began this coverage approximatelý a year and a half ago through
confidential arrangements made with postal authorities. Initially, this coverage
involved photographing of envelopes; these envelopes were not to be opened. The
envelopes were microfilmed and the names and addresses appearing thereon were
indexed with IBM equipment. Several months ago CIA began opening some of this mail,
microfilming the contents and indexing pertinent data therein. Approximately 250,000
names have been indexed by CIA. Examination of certain of this mail for microdots and
secret writing has been made to a limited extent because the volume of mail has been too
humerous for the establishment of a practical system without delaying movement of the
mail. CIA has advised that to date it has not discovered any microdots or secret writing
or information revealing evidence of Soviet intelligence operations in the United States.
CIA has also advised that this program has not reached its full potential, but that its
system of opening mail is rapidly increasing. CIA has expressed a willingness to
furnish us any information obtained from this coverage which we feel would be of
interest to us.
B
An analysis has been made of CIA capabilities as revealed to the Liaison Agent
and it is believed we should request that CIA furnish us information of the following
types, both that which has been received in the past and that which they will obtain in
the future
Prod
1) All correspondence of a suspicious nature, such as that containing double
talk, et cetera.
2) All correspondence indicating that the Soviets may be utilizing a hostage
situation, i.e., correspondence indicating pressure being exerted on (Soviet citizens who
have close relatives in the U.S. or pressure being exerted on individuals in U.S.
3) Any information appearing in correspondence indicating weaknesses or
dissatisfaction on the part of any Soviet presently in the United States so that the Bureau
might give consideration to feasibility of approaching such individuals for defection or
double agent purposes

re: COVERAGE OF MAIL TO THE (U.S.S.R.)
With regard to the above coverage, it is believed desirable that Liaison make
arrangements for us to review at CIA any material of this nature and we will then
select that which appears to warrant investigation and then make appropriate checks.
This procedure will eliminate. having CIA sending us a bunch of worthless material with
the possible expectation that we will be running out leads for them. It is believed this
arrangement can be worked out with CIA in a proper fashion.
In addition to the above it is believed the following arrangements can be
effected with CIA:
1) Place stops against names and addresses of individuals possibly presently,
engaged in (Soviet espionage to determine if they are in correspondence with U.S.S.R
This would include a check of the back traffic on these individuals also. We would, of
course, make these stops on a highly selective basis.
2) Request CIA to place stops against addresses in Soviet Russia believed by the
Bureau to be mail drops or suspected mail drops. (It should be noted that we already
have placed a stop with CIA against the name and address of K. S. Smirnov, Central
Post Office, Vladimir, U.S.S.R.), which, according to information received from 1-5,
is a drop utilized by (Soviet illegál (Soviet illegal agents all over the world arranging emergency meet
We will, of course, continue to analyze this coverage by CIA to see that we
obtain maximum benefits.

3)
That our Liaison Agent orally advise CIA of the type of data set forth above
that would be of interest to us and make arrangements with CIA so that we can review
this type of information in order to select that which we feel will warrant further
investigation. Liaison should also perfect the arrangement with CIA so that on a

9. In order to insure most efficient servicing of your request,
it is suggested that you submit trace requests as follows: List the
last name first with any known first and given names or initials, and
address including state, city and street, if known. If an exact address
is not known, a probable state or section will be helpful but is not
required. The same would apply to the (USSR) The above should be
listed on duplicate 3 x 5 cards. If only a phonetic name is known,
various combinations of spellings would be appreciated, together
with any other data such as probable address or area. Where an
address is known and there are individuals, other than the subject,
at this address to whom the questioned communication might be
addressed, their names should also be given. For record purposes
and in order to facilitate our answers to your request, would you in
turn number each card as HUNTER Request No.
10. On each request will you also indicate whether the request
is for a one-time check or whether the name should be put on the
Watch List. If the latter, please indicate the duration of the Watch
List, i. e. 30, 60, 90 days, or "until cancelled". If a Watch List is
requested, you should also indicate the treatment desired when a
possible hit is made, i. e. photograph outside only; photograph
outside and contents; photograph outside, contents, and examine for
S/W or microdots. Specifically indicate any Watch List item which
should not be opened. In this connection you may also desire to give:
us a white list of correspondents of interest to you whoare not Watch
List subjects but whose mail should not be opened in the course of
our normal openings for spot-checking for operational or intelligence
information. In some instances you may desire to indicate that you
are to be informed immediately when a hit is made and prior to the
receipt of the letter by the addressee.
II. It is possible to make a special machine run of the names
of all correspondents either addressor, addressee, or both, from
any specific area in the (USSR) to the United States or to any specific
state or city in the U.S., or vice versa. There are various other
combinations that could be run, such as all letters mailed in Florida
either on a specific date or for any given period. If the above-listed

or any other type of exploratory processing is desired, a presentation
of the problem will enable us to tell you immediately what we can do,
-how long it will take, and the amount of work that is involved. While
this type of service is possible, it does involve a great deal of work
and should be requested in connection with very important cases only.

(Bureau Informant 200) is the symbol number designated
for information furnished by CIA to the Bureau from its coverage
of mail going to and from the (USSR). This designation was approved
in your memorandum to Mr. Boardman dated 2-6-58. That memo pointed out
the willingness of CIA to furnish us any information obtained from this
coverage which we felt would be of interest to us. That memo recommended
that Liaison effect arrangements with CIA so that we could review
information obtained from that coverage.
CIA is furnishing us with certain of the results of the
coverage of Soviet mail under the caption "Project Hunter." Each report
received is labeled with a report number, for example, Hunter Report
# 19
The reports received are reviewed in the Soume (Soume) Unit. When
the information fails to indicate which Section or Unit 'would have a
logical interest in the report, the names involved will be searched
for identifiable information. Then we can locate no such information,
a case will be opened if deemed warranted. The objectives of those
investigations will be the ide identification of persons of pro-Soviet
sympathies whose dealings with the Russians are of a security or
intelligence interest, the identification of those individuals who
might present logical "hostage" possibilities which could be exploited
by the Soviets and the identification of any (Soviet) individual in the
U.S. who has indicated weakness or dissatisfaction, a situation which
the Bureau might exploit for defection or double agent purposes.
Investigations in the field would include a check of office
indices and logical sources and informants in order to establish the
subject's background, activities, sympathies and the strategic
character of his employment. This could culminate in recommendations
for interview to clarify certain points not established by investigation
and to determine whether the present activities of the subject are
inimical to the best interests of the U.S., provided available infor-
mation does not dictate against such interview and provided the
interview can be conducted without compromising (Bureau Informant 200
Information from Bureau Informant 200 would be forwarded to

then be summarized as necessary and paraphrased. Following the
reporting of information found in Bufiles on the subject, and
instructions regarding the investigation to be conducted a paragraph
as follows should also be added: "You are being cautioned that infor-
mation obtained from Bureau Informant 200 is not to be disseminated

reports. Information from this informant should be utilized for lead
purposes. only. You must avoid any statement concerning the scope of

is the subject or any unauthorized person to become aware that we have-
knowledge of his contact with a person in Russia)"
In those instances where an opened or closed case file an aj FR
person mentioned in a Hunter Report is located at the Bureau, the
Hunter Report will be forwarded to the appropirate Section Chief or
Supervisor for his information and any action he deems necessary. Said
Supervisor might desire to advise the field in the manner-described
above or place a brief, paraphrased version of the Hunter Report into
the subject's main file for information purposes.

In view of the extreme sensitivity of this source, the
knowledge of the same is to be confined to a need-to-know basis.
Therefore, within the Domestic Intelligence Division the Section
Chiefs of the Nationalities and Intelligence Section, the Internal

pionage activities between Special Agents (Papich, Litrento,
Duckett and it and Messrs. Angleton, Horton and Hunt) of CIA, we
I were advised that C IA has now established a laboratory in
New York in connection with this project which can examine cor-

He said the laboratory is fully equipped and they would be glad
to make its facilities available to us if at any time we desire
an examination of this nature to be made in NYC and time was of
the essence and would not permit the material to be brought to
our Laboratory in Washington, D.C. We expressed our appreciation
for the offer and said that in the event we desired to utilize
their laboratory, we would contact them.
