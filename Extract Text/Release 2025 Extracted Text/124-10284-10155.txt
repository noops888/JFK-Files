Re Paris letter 7/21/60.
During a visit to Bern, Switzerland, the captioned
matter was discussed with BURTON LIFSCHULTZ, Chief of the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Switzerland. He advised(s)
that the Cuban Ambassador, SALAZAR-SANCHEZ, had been dismissed
by the Cuban Government and his replacement has not yet
arrived. LIFSCHULTZ advised that it has been rumored that s
he will be replaced by one BAYO. He stated that this
individual has not as yet been definitely identified and
no background information is available regarding him. He
stated, however, that, he may be identical with the son
of "General" ALBERTO BAYO who has previously been reported
as a Spaniard who assisted in the CASTRO revolution and
who has reportedly been active in revolutionary activities
in Spain.
This is furnished for the information of the Bureau.
In the event further specific information is received, the
Bureau will be advised..
