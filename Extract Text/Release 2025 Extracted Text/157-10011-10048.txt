am not too far off in what I am about to tell you. The contract
was structured in such a way that as the bottoms of other
3
companies became obsolete, they could only be replaced with
4
Onassis' tankers.
Even ARAMCO had to, by attrition, within a
5
period of four-and-a-half to five-and-a-half years, would have,
6
7
if their tankers became obsolete, they could only be replaced
by Onassis tankers.
8
Our statistics, after having studied the contract and
9
10
11
WARD & PAUL

14
making what we considered to be proper projections, indicated
that at the completion of approximately five-and-a-half years,
Mr. Onassis would control more dead weight tonnage than the
United States controlled in its entirety, that he would control
on the high seas annually more oil by tens of thousands of
gallons more than were used by all of the Allied nations during
15
16
17
18
the most severe year of the Korean War, that in the first year
his profit would be approximately $17 million dollars, that
after five-and-a-half years his annual profit would be in the
area of $200 million.

While this analysis is going on, we also found that a

20 million dollar pay-off had been made to one of the top ministers
in Saudi Arabia and we had the evidence out of the Swiss bank
accounts, in other words, contrary to what a lot of peoplew
believe that they can't be broken, even in those days, they werd
broken and we had the evidence waltth all off the documentation.

We then prepared our inputs and presented them to the

be no way of stopping, I mean, he might go to Venezuela and
do the same thing, and there were also other inputs about the
background of Mr. Onassis that I would just as soon not make

old King Saud. Mr. Twitchell had spent time in the country
as a mining engineer to help them in the exploitation of
mines. It was in fact to Carl Twitchell that the old king gave
the power of attorney to come to the United States government
or come back to the United States and try to form a consortium
for the exploitation of oil from which emanated ARAMCO.
Carl was the type of man who was only reimbursed for his
expenses. I think his total expenses were slightly in excess
of $8,000. He didn't even keep the banking and percentage
for himself, or a piece of the action, so to speak, and he was
highly, highly loved by the Saudis and although the old king
was then gone and King Saud, the son, was in power, Mry
Twitchell had the same respect and reverence from the present
14
15

leaders as he did from the father and I convinced Mr. Twitchell
that he already had a clearance, a satisfactory clearance,
and I convinced him to precede me to Saudi Arabia to try to
lay the groundwork.

Senator Schweiker.
What year was this, roughly?
i
19
20
Mr. Maheu. This, I believe, was in '54 or '55, yes.
Anyway, I finally ended up going to Saudi Arabia, having
21
a meeting with the King's confidential assistant, presenting all
22
23
of this evidence, frankly at the time not knowing if the King
himself had a piece of the action

Had some of this evidence come from

Mr. Maheu. That tap was entirely unproductive, entirely
unproductive.
Senator Schweiker. What happened then at your meeting?
Mr. Maheu. Well, it's very interesting, if we could take
a little time, I mean, I was scheduled to have the meeting
"with the King," but he doesn't show, he stays somewhere else.
and the confidential assistant shows up and one trusted
minister that he had with Carl Twitchell present.

And my meeting was scheduled for 8:00p.m. one night, and
this happaned to be the last day that the King was supposed to
be in Jidda, he was then leaving for the capital further
inland, Jidda being the only major port in Saudi where he
spends his summers, and they were having a big parade for him,
:
14
and from the balcony of the hotel, I'm watching the parade go
15
16
17
18
by, and finally the King's car comes and he is arm and arm with
the nan on whom I'm going to give the evidence that night, and
I frankly was not too comfortable, particularly in view of the
fact that in those days and I don't know whether it has
changed, but in Saudi, the same document did not give you
19
20
21
22
23
permission to enter and leave; you had to make application for
an exit visa after you arrived, and I was in constant contact
with the then-United States Ambassador. He made it very clear
that the government approved of everything I was doing, but if
something went wrong they could not come to my rescue, I would
24
have to be the fall guy, and I was prepared to do it. That was

Saudi Arabian government would have its flag flying the high
2 seas, and at the time that all of this is going on they are

building what then, upon completion of production, had been
the biggest tanker in the world at that time, a ship named
after the old King, a tanker which was scheduled to go and take
5

a maiden flight and take off, and it turned out the biggest

problem that we had was to find a save-face gimmick.
But
8
finally the whole thing was accomplished, and it took two and
9
a half years to do it.
10
Senator Schweiker.
I didn't mean to get you off the
11
track.
12
Mr. Maheu. Well, I'm sorry I am so verbose.
13
Senator Huddleston.
14
15
You said you bought a paper in
Athens? You mean by that you actually bought the paper or just
paid them to run the story?
16
Mr. Maheu. We bought a newspaper.
17
You'll have to understand, Senator, that in Rome, in those
18
days, there were fifty newspapers.
I mean, the big circulation
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
19
20
in those days, big circulation in Rome was 20,000. It's hard
for us to visualize that.
21
22
Senator Huddleston. The CIA supplied the money to buy
the newspaper?
23
Mr. Maheu. Yes.
24
Can we go off the record?
25
Senator Schweiker.
Yes.

Do you recall whether he had any relation-

I got sidetracked off of my question of

whether you recall a prosecution or an investigation of the

Onassis wiretap.
You may have already have answered that.
Mr. Maheu.
18
I think I did, yes.

Mr. Madigan.
What did you say?
Mr. Maheu. My recollection is that I appeared before a

Grand Jury that was investigating Mr. Frank on another

matter.
Mr. Madigan. On another matter, but you had no recollection
of any investigation of that particular tap?

Mr. Madigan. Did there come a time when you were asked
by the Central Intelligence Agency to be involved in a
project which would involve sending a woman by the name of
Florence Horn over to a foreign country?
Mr. Maheu. Yes, sir.

a foreign country and under some pretext try to meet the

leader of the country and hopefully change his basic philosophies
which at the time were thought to be detrimental to the United
States, and that they were very, as a result, very seriously
jeopardizing the national security of the government of the
23
United States.
24
Mr. Madigan. Did you find such a woman? I

Mr. Maheu. Yes, I did.

Mr. Maheu. I placed her in touch with a representative

of the CIA. He made certain commitments, Financial commitments

to her. At the completion of the assignment, she claimed that
she had additional funds coming to her which I paid out of my

that the Agency and I sponsored her trip.

earlier by the name of Florence Horn, is that right??

That is correct.

Now can you date that assignment as sometime

any recollection of what year it was?

that the government was very much concerned that the type of
women that would be secured for him might eventually be very
destructive to the national security of the United Statep
government unless said women had been cleared by local police
departments in several of the cities in which he was scheduled
to travel?

apprised, however that the coordination was with the State
Department, in connection with the security that was being

Did you meet with the State Department or

Mr. Madigan.
And after you contacted the security

representatives, what were you supposed to do in these other
cities?

Mr. Maheu.
16
My recollection is that I, through local
17
Police Department officials or law enforcement officials made

certain that the women who would gain access to the leader's
suite were such that they would not be a security risk insofar
as the national security of our government was concerned.

of the project that you were involved in with the State
Department in providing the women to this foreign leader in the
Įvarious cities starting from New York and going through the
other cities he stayed at, do you believe the women that were
14 sent over to his hotel were prostitutes?
15
Mr. Maheu.
16
That they may have been, yes.

city were sort of local, so that they could be controlled
more or less, by the local police?
