that Lindsey LING, aka LING Lind sey, was the manager of a Chinese
restaurant located at rua Valaverde 9, Madrid, Spain, and that the
restaurant was owned by a second (unidentified) Chinese, who was
also supplying clothing to the United States personnel at the
Lajoe Base in the Agores. Theodor Reing/WIENER, who had represented
the clothing firm in the Azores, was reportedly arrested there in
December 1958 on a suspicion of espionage, and was, as of September
1960, reportedly in Bermuda, where LING was planning to go to
investigate setting up another restaurant.
The files contain no further information concerning Sub-
jects than that which is already believed to be contained in your
files.
