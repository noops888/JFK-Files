Michael Weimer Stratton has recently advised that Court 3
Foster Wood was a relatively close high school friend of Stratton).
during mutual attendance at George Mason High School, Falls Church,
Virginia, during 1957 to 1959. Stratton described Wood as an
average high school student who had no particular problems with
the exception that there were domestic difficulties between the
father and mother of Wood.
3
[Stratton became acquainted with the parents of Wood and made
occasional visits to their home during the above period of time.
The father of Wood, Foster Wood, is an attorney who was then living
in Falls Church. Some time ago the father and mother of Court Wood
split up and Court Wood and father moved into an apartment on
Columbia Road, Washington, D.C.
3
Stratton advised that after graduation from high school in
June 1959 he lost any close contact with Wood who then started to
attend George Mason College, where he seemed to have an interest
in philosophy. 3 Stratton started to attend a_military school and
Wood expressed extreme opposition to military schools.
3
3
Stratton married in 1960, which also helped to move (Stratton]
somewhat out of the social circle of Wood. 3 Stratton believed that
for approximately a year, during 1959 to 1960, he did not actually
see Wood but advised that after this period in which he did not
see Wood he has had a number of contacts with Wood, many of which
occurred during mutual attendance at the University of Virginia
Extension School (night school) in early 1961. On one occasion
3 Stratton attended a party at the apartment occupied by Wood and
father at the invitation of Wood, and on this occasion came into
contact with the "new set of friends" of Court Wood, whom Stratton3
described as being "beatnik types." Girls in attendance at the
party, according to Stratton, appeared to be of the "street pickup"
type.
3
After the above party Wood occasionally telephoned Stratton
and about Christmas 1960 Wood called and stated that he was going
to Cuba_under the auspices of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.
3 Stratton called on Wood after the return of Wood from Cuba and at
that time Wood lauded Castro very highly. The father of Wood was
also present and Stratton obtained the impression that the father
was also in sympathy with Castro. 3 Stratton recalled that he again,
at a later date, had visited the Wood apartment, this being an
occasion when Wood had been visiting somewhere in Falls Church
and contacted Stratton to ask Stratton to take Wood home. On this
