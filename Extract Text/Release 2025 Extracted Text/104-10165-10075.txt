Political Prisoner
in Hospital
Clémart Joseph Charles was taken
from the National Penitentiary in Port
au-Prince to Haiti's General Hospital.
The former Duvalier banker has been
jailed since isil "for political reasons"
No proper trial was held.
Mr. Charles is suffering from an
acute liver infection and the physi-
cians attending him have warned that
he will die unless he's allowed to tra-
vel abroad for special treatment.
This isn't the first time Mr. Char-
les was taken from his cell to a hos-
pital. Last year he was rushed to
Haiti's military hospital for treatment
of the same disease.
Mrs. Charles has been allowed to
visit her husband.
This is the first time the Duvalier
regime has acted half humanely with a
political prisoner. It's been pointed
out that Marie-Denise Duvalier Domi-
nique, a friend of Mr. Charles, has
often interceded for him.
Army chief-of-staff Jean-Baptis-
te Hilaire will soon be replaced, say
military sources in Port-au-Prince.
His likely replacement? Col. Roger
St. Albain.
On a lighter note, the General ran
for cover on September 22 while there
was a review on the Palace grounds
to commemorate Duvalier's "election"
in 1957. Accidentally the loaded auto-
matic wezpen of a railitiaman went off
Many officials, General Hilaire among
them, scrambled for protection, Jean-
Claude, his mother and their body-
guard General Gracia Jacques were
trembling, but they kept standing, says
a-source that was standing close to
them.

SOURCE A reliable source fron a Haitian exile leader who is well

would reach the U.S. Government.
former president of
1. Clemard Joseph Charles,
the Commercial Bank of Haiti who has been held political
prisoner since April 1970 on charges of plotting against the
government, was recently transferred from jail to the general
hospital in Port-au-Prince. Charles is said to be dying of
cirrhosis of the liver and was transferred to the hospital on
orders of Madame Simone Ovide Duvalier, mother of
Haitian President Jean Claude Duvalier.
2. Doctors recommended that Charles be sent abroad for
proper medical treatment but me. Duvalier authorized his
transfer only to the local hospital. According to close
relatives, this occurred only after Minister of Interior and
Defense Paul Blanchettold the President and his
mother that he would refuse to become involved in this case
and would not sign any papers required of him as Minister
of Interior certifying that Charles had died in prison.
Relatives of Charles still intend to press for his removal fron
the country.

2. (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: THE SAME SOURCE REPORTED IN
TDCS-314/01942-72 THAT DURING A MEETING ON 16 MARCH 1972
BETWEEN THE TWO,
CAMBRONNE TOLD JOSEPH THE GOH CONSIDERED
THE "HAITI OBSERVATEUR" AND ITS SUPPORTERS TO BE THE ONLY OBSTACLE
TO THE GOH'S PLANS TO REUNITE ALL KHAITIANS IN AN EFFORT TO BUILD
A NEW, PROGRESSIVE NATION. AS A FIRST STEP TO RAPPROCHEMENT,
CAMBRONNE ASKED JOSEPH TO REALIGN HIMSELF WITH THE GOH AND RETURN
TO HAITI. IF JOSEPH ACCEPTED, CAMERONNE SAID, THE GOH WOULD BE
WILLING TO NAME HIM TO WHATEVER OFFICIAL POSITION HE DESIRED EITHER
INSIDE HAITI OR ABROAD.)
3. JOSEPH REPLIED THAT BEFORE HE OR THE "HAITI OBSERVATEUR"
COULD GIVE ANY THOUGHT TO SOFTENING THEIR POSITIONS ON THE GOH,
THE GOH WOULD HAVE TO SHOW ITS GOOD INTENTIONS THROUGH DEEDS PATHER
THAN MERE PROMISES. CAMBRONNE THEN INVITED THE "HAITI OBSERVATEUR"
TO SEND A TEAN OF REPORTERS TO HAITI TO SEE FOR THEMSELVES THE
CHANGES WHICH WERE BEING BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE REGIME OF PRESIDENT
JEAN-CLAUDE DUVALIER. BEFORE SUCH A TRIP COULD BE MADE,
JOSEPH SAID, POLITICAL PRISONERS WOULD HAVE TO BE RELEASED. ALSO,

RELEASE SUCH POLITICAL PRISONERS AS.HUBERT LEGROS, CLEMARD
JOSEPH CHARLES, AND COL. KESNER BLAIN AS CAMBRONNE

CAMBRONNE REPLIED THAT HE CONSIDERED LEGROS TO BE A VERY DANGEROUS
MAN AND THAT HE HAD NO INTENTION OF EVER RELEASING HIM. (HEAD-
QUARTERS COMMENT: LEGROS, A LAWYER AND SELF-PROCLAIMED COMMUNIST,
WAS ARRESTED IN MAY 1970 AFTER HAVING BEEN SOUGHT BY HAITIAN
AUTHORITIES FOR SEVERAL YEARS. CHARLES, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE
COMMERCIAL BANK OF HAITI, AND BLAIN, FORMER COMMANDANT OF THE
