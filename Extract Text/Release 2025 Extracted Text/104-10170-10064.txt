ABSTRACT

PL
1. SUMMARY. The Reference A. AMSPELL exhibit toured six
Latin American countries during a five-month period, February-June
1964. With the exception of Guayaquil and La Paz -- where excel-
lent results were achieved the tour was only moderately success-
ful, and must be classified a failure in Quito, Santiago and
Montevideo. According to AMSPELL, the total number of persons who
viewed the exhibit was 6,720. Another 2,792 persons reportedly
attended conferences at which the AMSPELL team gave talks on the
Reference A. exhibit and the dangers and weaknesses of Castro-
Communism. Publicity was given the exhibit by 34 newspapers (47
items), 30 radio stations, and six television stations. AMSPELL
estimated the TV audience at 1,300,000. Sample clippings are
enclosed under separate cover. Reports from WH stations and the
WAVE debriefing of the AMSPELL team lead us to conclude that the
tour was a moderate success that could have been much better if
if had been better organized and if the AMSPELL team had had more
experience. (On balance) we believe the tour was well worth the
approximately $12,000.00 KUBARK paid out. We do not, however,
believe it should be repeated in the foreseeable future in view
of the relative inexperience shown by the AMSPELL team on the
recent tour and the many difficulties encountered in trying to
organize the exhibit in the various cities.

COLOMBIA.
a. Bogota, The AMSPELL team arrived in Bogota on 12 February
1964. but were unable to make contact with the local AUSPELL/AMBARB
contact until the next day. They were unable to get adequate advance
publicity and had trouble finding space for the exhibit. About 200.
persons attended the exhibit, and AMSPELL conferences were attended by
approximately 485 persons. HLBA-6911reported GISNEAKER-9's observations
on the local reaction to the tour, which he judged to be indifferent.
The AMSPELL team freely admitted to WAVE that the Bogota operation was
something less than successful, but blamed the lack of advance prepara-
tions and the existence of an unfriendly press for their failure.
should also be noted that the AMSPELL team was not on the best of terms
with some of the local Cubans, and this fact probably had a good deal
to do with the poor showing.
It
b. Medellin. The showing in Medellin was better than in
Bogota. The press was lukewarm but the director of the Caracol radio
station gave them considerable publicity, and they were able to hold
the exhibit in a central spot in the city. About 400 persons visited
the exhibit over a period of three days, and 850 persons attended con-
ferences given by the team.
c. Cali. The team received good advance press play in Cali,
which was perhaps one reason for the fact that the local Communist party
was also well prepared for their arrival. On the very first morning
of the exhibit, a large crowd of Communists tried to enter the exhibit
with the obvious intention of starting trouble. and when they were
locked out began to throw rocks and "stinkbombs" into the exhibit hall.
The incident provided considerable publicity for AMSPELL, as reported
in BOGO 4332. A total of 100 persons attended the exhibit. The AMSPELL
team claimed that the Communists were very strong in Cali and that work-
ing there was like swimming upstream.
3. ECUADOR.
a. Quito. The team arrived in Quito on 25 March, after spend-
ing several days in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain visas for Peru.
QUIT 5867 reported the AMSPELL team's personality clashes with the
local AMBARBs and the consequent poor performance by the AMSPELL team,
who complained of the absence of police protection, adequate facilities
for the exhibit, etc., and departed just two days later on the 27th.
One member remained in Bogota to hold conferences, attended by 325.
persons. While not accepting the blame for this fiasco, the AMSPELL
team generally corroborated the above story in their debriefing by WAVE.
After such incidents as reported in QUIT 5867, we are reluctant to
recommend any future tours.

exhibit received front page coverage in "El Universo" and "El Telegrafo"!
and they were given a half hour on a major TV station. An estimated
total of 1,200 persons visited the exhibit, and the team spoke before
40 members of a local group, Frente de Defensa Nacional.
4. Santiago, Chile.
The AMSPELL team arrived in Santiago on 5 March to coincide
The
with the opening of the Latin American Youth Congress (LAYC).
Santiago operation was a complete loss because Chilean customs authori-
ties would not release the exhibit during the congress and the AMSPELL
team was unable to obtain space of any kind to hold conferences due to
competition from the congress for space. (See SAGO 6577). The AMSPELL
team had been counting on a contact in the Catholic University, Fernando 04
SANHUESA, to facilitate their activities but SANHUESA told them that
the LAYC was a failure from the Communist side and that the AMSPELL tean
could contribute more by remaining quiet than by actively propagandizing

performance on 25 March at the Scala Theater hosted by the Venezuelan
ambassador. The exhibit received excellent coverage in all four of the
leading La Paz newspapers and the three largest radio stations carried
AMSPELL conferences. Despite the excellent publicity, a total of only
600 persons visited the exhibit in La Paz. According to AMSPELL, this
was due to Bolivian preoccupation with such things as a national day to
demand a passage to the sea for Bolivia which stopped all traffic and
communication.
6. Argentina.
a. Buenos Aires. The AMSPELL team arrived in Buenos Aires on
27 March during Holy Week. In addition to the delay caused by Holy Week
celebrations, the team had difficulty finding space for the oxhibit.
With the help of the Chamber of Commerce, the exhibit finally opened on
6 April in Chamber of Commerce offices on Leandro Allem street. An
estimated 1,200 persons visited the exhibit during a four-day period,
and good publicity was also obtained in the La Prensa and La Razon
newspapers. The AMSPELL group also obtained 10 minutes on Panorama
Mundial, Channel 7 TV, as part of a 30-minute program on Cuba and the
overthrow of Goulart in Brazil. According to AMSPELL, the Panorama
program is rated as having 500,000 viewers. The AMSPELL team also held.

8. Caracas, Venezuela. The AMSPELL team arrived in Caracas on
9. May, having cut ut Brazil from the tour because of visa problems. Their
early arrival caught their local contacts unprepared and it was not
until 16 May that the exhibit opened. Excellent support was provided
by station assets and widespread publicity was given to the event.
However, the exhibit was located in a relatively remote spot and only
300 persons attended the exhibit, according to AMSPELL. (The Station
estimate was 400-500). Another 140 persons attonded ANSPELL con-
forences. The station report (HVCA-11393) which has been corroborated
by the WAVE debriefing of the AMSPELL team, describes the typical
experience of the AMSPELL team throughout the tour with the exception
that local support was not always as effective as in Caracas.
9. Enclosed under separate cover is an AMSPELL statistical summary
of the tour and press clippings from the countrios visited.
