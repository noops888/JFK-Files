CONTACT AND DEVELOPMENT
1. INDICATE HOW, WHEN, WHERE, WHY AND BY WHOM SUBJECT WAS FIRST CONTACTED OR DEVELOPED.
In response to Headquarters requests, London Station officer George H. Katzenbach
contacted Subject in London in mid-January 1965 for the purpose of debriefing him on
his experiences in the pro-ChiCom milieu in Africa and Western Europe up to the time
of his departure from the staff of Revolution in Spring 1964. This was followed up by
in-depth debriefing sessions carried out by Katzenbach in a PBSWING conference room
on 17,18,19 and 23 February. On the basis of these talks it was decided to recruit
Subject for a test assignment in Algiers during the summer of 1965 during which time
he would attempt to build long-term access and cover for reporting on activities and
personalities in the Afro-Asian community. KUDESK/ICG staffer Joseph S. Tiffany
was dispatched to London TDY 1-7 June for this purpose. After recruitment and
agreement to LCFLUTTER examination, Subject was introduced to his Paris-based Case
Officer, Rufus F. PODIGAST, on 3 June.
2. INDICATE WHETHER SUBJECT COULD BE TURNED OVER QUICKLY AND IN A SECURE MANNER TO ANY RESPONSIBLE CASE OFFICER FOR
HANDLING. IF SO, INDICATE TO WHOM.
Yes. To any Case Officer introduced to him by RODIGAST, TIFFANY or
KATZENBACH.
3. LIST OTHER CASE OFFICERS WHO HAVE HANDLED SUBJECT OR WHOM HE KNOWS OR HAS KNOWN. GIVE NAMES BY WHICH THEY HAVE
BEEN KNOWN.
KATZENBACH - known to Subject as "Earl Wilson"
TIFFANY - "Robert 'Bob' Gustke"
RODIGAST - "Paul Weller"
SECTION II
SECRET
MOTIVATION AND CONTROL
1. ESTIMATE SUBJECT'S MOTIVATION. (Be detailed; preferably cite evidence. Do not use stock comment such as "an
opportunist".)
Subject's lack of funds and a job are of primary importance. His need for
cash (evidenced to some extent by his attempt to peddle articles to China Quarterly,
Encounter and Atlantic Monthly in the fall of '64) was critical. But of even
greater significance is his desire to effect his long-range rehabilitation in order
not to be stuck in the morass of the impecunious and "morally fraudulent" extreme left.
2. INDICATE WHAT CONTROL, IF ANY, EXISTS OVER THE SUBJECT. (If no control, or if there is a lack of real control,
explain.)
For the rest of his life. Also important in Subject's motivation is the sense of
adventure connected with "The Game", which is enhanced by his desire to deceive
(to put one over on) those persons, such as Verges, who exploited and deceived him.
Subj. evinces deep contempt for these professional revolutionaries and what he
refers to, with feeling, as their "moral fraud".
Control exists quite strongly in the area of Subject's material welfare and
need for rehabilitation.
SECTION III
COVER
1. COVER USED BY SUBJECT AND CASE OFFICER IN THEIR MEETINGS.
Subj. explained to his wife that "Wilson" (Katzenbach), who telephoned his home,
was an American publisher's representative. Subj. and Rodigast will use a journalist/
literary agent cover in the unlikely event their clandestine meetings are compromised.
2. COVER USED BY SUBJECT IN OBTAINING HIS INFORMATION AND IN CONTACTING HIS INFORMANTS.
Freelance journalist, author. Sympathetic list.
3. INDICATE SERVICE FOR WHICH SUBJECT THINKS HE (Will work) (Is working).
KUBARK
SECTION IV
INTELLIGENCE CONNECTIONS AND TRAINING
1. EXPLAIN SUBJECT'S KNOWN PAST OR PRESENT CONNECTION WITH ANY OTHER INTELLIGENCE SERVICE. INDICATE THE EXTENT
SUCH CONNECTION IS KNOWN OVERTLY.
Subj. applied for association with KUBARK in 1950 and again in 1960; his enemies
have tried to discredit him by calling him a KUBARK agent, but there is good evidence
that this rumor campaign has not hurt him among his friends, even his friends on the
extreme left of the political spectrum. No known I.S. connection.
2. LIST OTHER INDIVIDUALS (Agents, relatives, friends) WHO KNOW OF SUBJECT'S PRESENT INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES.
None.
3. EXPLAIN ANY TRAINING SUBJECT HAS HAD IN CLANDESTINE OPERATIONS.
Basic security tradecraft briefings in London, 1-7 June 1965;
SW training in Paris, 14 June 1965.
SECTION V
COLLABORATION POTENTIAL
1. INDICATE OTHER FOREIGN POWER SUBJECT COULD BE MOST LIKELY TO COLLABORATE WITH BECAUSE OF HIS IDEOLOGY OR PAST
ASSOCIATIONS. EXPLAIN.
British. Subj. resided in London from June '64 to June '65. His wife is
a British subject.

SECRET
SECTION VI
OPERATIONAL USE - CONTACT
1. IF SUBJECT HAS BEEN USED OR CONTACTED BEFORE, INDICATE ACTIVITY IN WHICH HE HAS ENGAGED AND THE TYPE OF INFOR-
MATION HE HAS FURNISHED.
In December 1963 Subj. was interviewed by a consulate officer in Paris for
information on Lee Harvey Oswald, who reportedly had some contact with the Fair
Play for Cuba Committee. Subj. was completely co-operative and the interviewer
suggested follow-up, but the contact was dropped.
2. INDICATE HOW AND FROM WHOM SUBJECT OBTAINS INFORMATION.
Subj. elicits information from his broad circle of friends and acquaintances
in the Afro-Asian/liberation movement areas.
3. INDICATE WHAT HAS BEEN TOLD SUBJECT AS TO THE DISPOSITION OF INFORMATION HE FURNISHES.
Nothing.
4. DETAIL SUBJECT'S PROPOSED FOR CI TYPE USE OR DUTIES.
Subject will operate under free lance journalist cover to develop contacts
in the target milieu of Afro-Asian "Anti-imperialist" activity and solicit informa-
tion from them on their activity, plans and views. It is possible that such
contacts may lead to a possibility of employment or association with some organ-
ization in this field, but whether or not he will be instructed to accept will
depend on the specific nature of the job and similar factors which cannot be
anticipated now.
5. DETAIL SUBJECT'S PROPOSED PP-PM TYPE USE OR DUTIES.
No PM duties or use is anticipated. No systematic CA exploitation is
anticipated given the risk of compromise. Selective CA exploitation within his cover
situation - i.e. as a provocateur or means to surface anti-Soviet material
from a "National Liberation" standpoint - will be continually possible.

AGENCY RELATIONSHIP WITH SUBJECT
1. EXPLAIN NATURE OF AGENCY RELATIONSHIP WITH SUBJECT: I.E. TRAINEE, OPPOSITE NUMBER; REMUNERATION, IF ANY; AGENCY
PERSONNEL KNOWN TO SUBJECT.
Subj. has a contract for 1 June - September 1965 providing for salary of
$500.00 per month, non-accountable expenses of $100.00 per month and per diem
computed at the rate of $20 for days spent travelling to and from Algiers and
$10 for period of residence in Algiers. (The $10 rate represents an oral amendment

SECTION X
COMMITMENTS
1. IF IT IS PROPOSED TO PAY SUBJECT A REGULAR SALARY, INDICATE THE WEEKLY AMOUNT. IF PAYMENT TO BE MADE IN EXCHANGE
FOR COMMODITIES, SUBSIDY OR OTHER METHOD, SPECIFY AND GIVE DETAILS.
See Section VIII. In addition it is set forth in the Letter of Agreement
with Subject, that KUBARK will compensate Subject for any relocation of his family
required by virtue of an approved change in place of employment.
2. EXPLAIN ANY PROMISES, OTHERWISE NOT COVERED HEREIN, MADE TO SUBJECT. (Example: Commitments regarding evacuation
of subject and family.)

No POA required under the terms of CSI 10-5.
4. DATE APPROVAL OBTAINED
5. EVALUATE SUBJECT'S CHARACTER, RELIABILITY AND SECURITY, CITING EVIDENCE WHERE POSSIBLE.
Subject is a rather cynical intellectual. He has a keen sense of what is in his
best interest, however, and there is every reason to believe that he considers a
reliable and secure performance for KUBARK to be in his best interest. He showed
a good sense of security in communications during his recruitment period. LCFLUTTER
examination 13 June 1965 revealed no deception by Subject.
6. EXPLAIN ANY SITUATION OR INDISCRETION IN WHICH SUBJECT MAY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WHICH MUST BE EVALUATED FROM A
CI/OPERATIONAL SECURITY VIEWPOINT.
While working for AFP in Paris (1958) Subject forged the signature of a personal
enemy, Ollie Harrington, to a letter to the editor calculated to get Harrington in
trouble with French authorities. Subject ashamed of this action.
SECTION XII
SUBJECT'S PERSONAL HABITS
1. USE OF LIQUOR, DRUGS; GAMBLING, PARAMOURS.
Liquor in moderation, no drugs. He is believed to have engaged in extra-marital

SECTION XV
EMERGENCY CONDITIONS - RECONTACT ARRANGEMENTS
1. GIVE FULL DETAILS, I.E. RECOGNITION SIGNALS, WHERE COULD CONTACT BE MADE, WHAT BONA FIDES COULD INDIVIDUAL MAKING
CONTACT USE.
Original method of contact was phone call to Subject's home (by Katzenbach) using
the name Wilson. Subsequent RODIGAST contacts have been laid on at prior meetings
and vary as to time and place. A signal is provided for (removal of glasses, which
both wear) should either wish to prevent the meeting. A simple carbon-pad type, low-
level SW was used by Subject for sending emergency messages to a Paris drop. This
has been replaced by an open code system to cover specific requirements, laid on at
each meeting.

RE: 43-3-(CHECK "X" ONE)
MARKED FOR INDEXING
NO INDEXING REQUIRED
INDEXING CAN BE JUDGED
BY QUALIFIED HQ. DESK ONLY
1. Pursuant to the suggestion contained in DIR 04341, 23 April 1965,
we asked JAGUAR to lay on such coverage as they could manage. After some
weeks had passed, and JAGUAR had not moved in this direction, we repeated
our request, pointing out that STEBONY/1 would soon be leaving. Short-
handed and hampered by certain restrictions, JAGUAR moved in to do what
they could, and their coverage was due to start almost at the same time
as TIFFANY was to begin his meetings with S/1. We contacted JAGUAR and
told them to lay off (much to our chagrin) for the time being. This they
did, but then, without our being advised, they resumed their coverage.
We don't know exactly how long they actually had him in their sights,
but they have now given us a letter (text below) suggesting that he was
watched on 5, 6 and 7 June. A JAGUAR officer advised us informally
that S/1 "seemed to be out of town" for one or two days. (TIFFANY had
mentioned that he might take S/1 to the country for a day, but we don't
know whether in fact he did so.)
2. Here is JAGUAR's note:
"As explained in conversation on the 8th June 1965, we
have received a report on S/1's movements during the period 5th -
7th June, 1965. Nothing of interest was learnt about his movements
on the 6th and 7th June, but you may be interested in the following
information relating to the 5th June: -
"S/1 left his home at 11.25 and travelled by taxi to
the Haymarket where he entered the American Express offices.
He obtained a ticket for an air passage to Brussels and
a train journey to Basle, thence to Lausanne and Paris where
he was due to arrive on the 10th June. He paid £20-2s-1d
for his ticket. He left the American Express at 12.30 and
subsequently returned home at 13.20 hours.
"He left home again at 14.05 and went to the Clarendon
Court Hotel in Kanda Vale. He came out of the building
after five minutes and wandered around for twenty minutes
before returning to the hotel. He stayed there until 18.45
when he left alone and returned home."
3. The JAGUAR officer also told me that S/1's contact at the Clarendon
Court Hotel was not identified by the surveillant, who in fact did not
know which room S/1 had visited. The contact, of course, was TIFFANY,
registered as GUSTKE.

LCPIPET felt that S/1: had absorbed sufficiently the guidance given him,
had responded satisfactorily to Case Officer control, was apparently clear of

SECRET/KAPOK
Personally, S/1 appeared to understand and to follow good security
practices by and large, but he was concerned that his wife now suspected him
of being "up to something" of which she did not approve. In short, his overall
long-term security appeared nearest to loose. Nevertheless, he appeared
highly confident that previous denunciations to which he had been subjected
would not "stick" and that he could rapidly reestablish himself among revolutionary
circles.
His relationship to KUBARK over the longer period has apparently
been of considerable interest to him, to the extent that he stated he would be
interested in some sort of career status with KUBARK (with retirement benefits)
and perhaps one day a "less covert" position. At this time in our relationship
with S/1, however, LCPIPIT is concerned primarily with what to do with his
on 1 September 1965. In fact, in view of the 19-20 June developments in Algiers
and the possible postponement of most of the activities S/1 was to cover in
efforts to reestablish himself as a legitimate propagandist for national liber-
ation movements, KUBARK may find it not only feasible, but necessary, to revise
S/1's initial KUBARK mission.
In the days and weeks to come we will be reporting S/1's progress as
he relates his accomplishments and problems through S/1 communications and in
meetings with RODIGAST. We shall be submitting recommendations on S/1's longer-
term utility to KUBARK as we have more information upon which to make some
judgments. We know that addressees will be subjecting the STEBONY operation
to constant evaluation and analysis throughout the summer, and we will appreciate
continued and coordinated guidance on how best to exploit the unique potential
represented by this asset.
1. LCPIPET SUPPORT FOR THE STEBONY OPERATION
1. On 3 June 1965 STEBONY/1 signed a letter of agreement with
ODFONE in London, in effect a contract with KUBARK. Upon signing the letter
of agreement and agreeing to undergo an LCFLUTTER examination, S/1 was introduced
to Rufus F. RODIGAST, a KUWOLF Career Agent based in Paris who had been designated
S/1's outside case officer. RODIGAST is known to S/1 under the alias "Paul
Weller". RODIGAST met at length with S/1 on 3, 5, and 6 June and made arrangements
for S/1 to meet him in Paris 12 June and undergo further training, briefing,
and security processing prior to embarking on a trial assignment of some 10 weeks.
2. On 12 June 1965 S/1 made contact with RODIGAST in Paris in
accordance with instructions and was taken immediately to a safehouse for
debriefing on his 8-11 June trip in West Europe and for training in the use
of S/W system 64. RODIGAST's Contact Report on this meeting and his report of
the debriefing are included in Attachment 3 (USC). S/1 was passed $200.00
for travel arrangements for his trip to North Africa. (See also PALP 4057).
3. On 13 June S/1 again met RODIGAST in accordance with instructions
and was taken to his LCFLUTTER examination at an LCPIPET safehouse. The results
of this examination were forwarded in PALP 4056. In short, the outcome of the
examination was considered satisfactory for the proposed operational use of S/1.
4. On 14 and 15 June RODIGAST again met with S/1 for further
debriefings on the latter's contacts in Paris. RODIGAST then briefed him on
KUBARK requirements for SW and passed on the requirements for SW training
forwarded in DIR 18107 and DIR 18675. RODIGAST's reports on these meetings
are also included in Attachment 8 (USC). On 14 June S/1 was passed $500.00
as an advance on his per diem and travel expenses for his next meeting with
RODIGAST. RODIGAST considers S/1 an apt student who learned the SW system
well in some two hours of instruction. Paris KUBARK Officer DONARY noted
some carelessness on S/1's part in the test messages, and this was subsequently
brought to S/1's attention in the overall security briefing he received from
RODIGAST.
5. The communications system established with S/1 consists of
pre-arranged meeting sites and times, a one-way SW system, and the use of the
classified advertising section of the Algiers El Moudjahid (received daily in
Paris) by S/1 to signal a postponement of meeting dates. The one-way system was
chosen for this initial stage of the agent's operational relationship with KUBARK
for reasons of security, given the operational climate in Algiers and the
specific circles in which S/1 must move, and adding to the sudden political
upheaval in Algeria, S/1 would not be in a position to receive incoming com-
munications safely. As of 23 June S/1 had initiated SW correspondence, his initial
effort being clearly legible and the content operationally worthwhile. (See
Attachment P).
6. The next RODIGAST contact with S/1 is scheduled for 15 July in
Rome. (See OPLA 2538 for LCPIPIT's request for Rome Station support.) In
view of the events that have just taken place in Algeria the meeting may well
be concerned as much with rethinking S/1's operational objectives for the
period following 16 July as with debriefings, briefings, and passage of funds.
Even though latest indications are that Bandung II will proceed as scheduled,
it is questionable whether the AAJA or the Afro-Asian Women's conference will be
held in Algiers this summer. Moreover, there is no assurance at this writing
that MEMINCE will not be either postponed, cancelled, or moved elsewhere. Add
to this the possibility that IDEN A might be on the scene profiting from the
sudden rise in the political fortunes of his friends, and Algiers suddenly
loses some of its appeal as an area in which to carry out a meaningful test
of S/1's operational capabilities. The next three weeks will tell us much
and perhaps allay many of our apprehensions.
7. Nevertheless, RODIGAST must be prepared to handle a number of
eventualities in his 15 July meeting, not the least of these being a possible
revision of S/1's mission. The following possible alternatives present them-
selves; we ask Headquarters to address its attention to these and to other
developmental targets and to cable recommendations and guidance prior to 13
July:
A. S/1 to remain on site, continue his efforts to establish
credentials and find a job in Algiers, or elsewhere, in the national liberation
movement, and report on political developments in Algeria.
B. S/1 to travel to Dar es Salaam to look into the job offer made
some time ago by Dennis PROGEAR.
C. S/1 to proceed to Brussels to continue development of IDEN B
(see OPLA 2541).
D. S/1 to return to London to write up reports and operational
proposals and polish up the translation of IDEN B's book.
E. S/1 to follow the KUBARK caravan wherever it may lead (perhaps
Sofia?) and continue to look for job leads (outside the Bloc).
8. The second RODIGAST meeting of the summer with S/1 is tentatively
scheduled for the second week in August, site to be determined. Addressees will
know that S/1's wife is expecting their third child o/a 11 August and that S/1
intends to be in London at that time if at all possible. Although he told
RODIGAST he would forego a visit to London at that time if it were operationally
necessary, he would find it difficult to justify his absence to his wife unless
he were to have a truly plausible and urgent cover assignment. We must therefore
anticipate in all likelihood that S/1 will be out of action for most of the
second week of August. In any event, RODIGAST will probably be able to meet
S/1 somewhere in Europe when S/1 returns to be with his wife and will at that
time hope to be in a position to discuss with S/1 the best employment of his
talents for the
