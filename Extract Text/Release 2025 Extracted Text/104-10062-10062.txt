F
On August 4, 1969, the source was contacted
by telephone at his place of employment in Carlstadt, New Jersey,
by Lazáre Eddy Espinosa Bonet, Third Secretary to the
Cuban Mission to the United Nations (CMUN). Espinosa
requested the source to meet him at 11:00 AM, August 5)
1969, on the corner of Bronx Park East and Allerton
Avenue, Bronx, New York. The source went to designated
meet area on August 5, 1969, arriving at approximately
10:50 AM and remaining until 11:25 AM. No attempt to)
contact source was made during that interval.
On August 11, 1969, source's wife received a
telephone call at the source's home, in Union City, New
Jersey, from an individual who did not identify himself.
A message was left for source which instructed him to
appear at the previously mentioned meet location at
11:00 AM, August 12, 1969.
The source arrived at the meet site at the
intersection of Bronx Park East and Allerton Avenue,
Bronx, New York, at approximately 10:30 A!!, whereupon he
was immediately contacted by Espinosa, who had been
waiting in a parked car on Allerton Avenue. Espinosa
and source proceeded on foot a short distance toward the
Interior of Bronx Park and sat doan on the grass in a
shady area. Espinosa took out from a small handbag which
he was carrying a Sony Miniature Tape Recorder which
measured approximately 9 inches by 4 inches by 3 inches.

During the ensuing conversation which lasted
from 10:30 AM until 7:30 PM, the source counted three
or four reels of tape utilized by Espinosa and each reel
would record for about one hour, or approximately thirty
minutes on each side. Espinosa, whose true identity had
not been revealed to the source, requested him to call
him "Esteban," Referring to a report prepared by source
and left at a drop site in Union City, New Jersey, on
May 18, 1969, Espinosa stated that the report had been
poorly prepared and lacked necessary detail. He directed
the source to be more specific and thorough in answering
any questions for future reports.
Espinosa proceeded to review with the source
the information furnished by source in the previous report.
Espinosa was quick to cite any small discrepancy between
the information contained in the report and that which was
furnished by the source during their conversation.
Espinosa queried the source in connection with
individuals in Miami with whom the source had been familiar.
The questions concerning these individuals included their
current addresses, general background and sympathies,
activity in Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operations,
etc.
Espinosa displayed a photograph of (First Name
Unknown) Mellado and asked source if he recognized him.
Mellado was described as male, of Caucasian race, who
appeared to be Cuban, 32-35 years old, husky build, dark
hair and dark eyes. The source could not recognize the
individual photographed.
Espinosa made several inquiries about "Frank",
a non-existent individual who the source intentionally
included in his prior report as a principal agent for CIA.
The source advised Espinosa that he met "Frank" on only
two or three occasions and knew nothing more specifically
about him.
While the source was answering a question
concerning an individual named "Piche", Espinosa inadvertently
referred to "Piche" as Epifanio Romero, which the source
knew as the true name of "Piche." | Romero is known by
Espinosa to have been previously connected with CIA

operations in Africa as well as the Miami area. He was
especially interested in whether the source knew any
dates of forthcoming infiltration runs into Cuba in which
Romero might be involved.
Espinosa mentioned Raul Villaverde and asked
the source if Rafael Villaverac is the brother of Raul.
He further questioned the source whether or not Raul
is still a CIA instructor in the use of explosives.
The fact that Raul was in any way connected with instruction
in the use of explosives was never mentioned previously
by source in his report and must have been obtained by
Espinosa from other sources.
The source happened to mention "La Osa", a
nickname for a past team member for infiltration runs
Into Cuba. Referring to "La Osa", Espinosa interrupted
and stated "Oh, Filiberto Leon Delgado," Source had
forgotten the true name of "La Osa" and said that this
identity must have been furnished to Espinosa through
other sources.
Also asked of the source was whether Justo,
Luis Llorett, a colleague of source, was still operating
for CIA. The source replied he did not know, inasmuch as
he had been too long removed from Miami area to be accurate
in his reply.
Espinosa made inquiries on the following
individuals with whom the source had been thought to
associate in Miami area; specifically, he wanted to know
any background information and whether or not the individuals
were being directed by CIA:
Otto (Last Name Unknown), previously of
operational interest to CIA in the Miami area.
..
Javier Souto, previously a principal agent
in the Miami area for CIA.
Edgar Sopo, active in anti-Castro radio
broadcasts to Cuba from the Miami area.

the above individuals and used as an excuse that although
he was on close terrs with nost of them, he has had little
or no contact with then since leaving the Miami area.
Of all the individuals naned by Espinosa, he
appeared most concerned in obtaining any information on
Dr. Cesar Baro and Dr. Fernando Cabezas, Both individuals
had been associates of the source in Havana and Cabezas
had worked with the source in Havana. He advised Espinosa
that although both are known to be anti-Castro, he did not

On at least three occasions, Hopinose asked
the courco about the degree of fluency of the latter's
spoken and written iglich and asked if he is able to
rolato with Loricare. He was sceaingly impressed when
the source answered affinctively and cxplained that he

Espinosa queried the cource about scho
infiltration runs into Cuba that the cource had led.
Espinosa nentioned spseific runs in which the source
participated which had not been nontioned proviously
by the cource. Ho seened to be very well prepared and
gave the impression that ho know the answers to all the
questions directed at the source. Ho was interested in

infiltration tears, whether members of the teams were

vessel, the bases from which they operate, and the crew
members. The source stated he could not answer these

vas connected with CIA operations in liiami.

wessel, intermediary vessels, landing crafts, and the
establishment of intelligence nets inside Cuba. Apparently

Asked how teams were able to build sheds
and living quarters in the cangrove cacups inside of
Cuba Vithout being noticed by natives in the same area,
the source replied that everyone in the vicinity of the
infiltration points vere syupathetic to the teams. The
somce explained that one person in charge of an observation
post approximately one mile away from one infiltration
point cooperated with the teans and was later taken out
of Cuba by the source.
Espinosa asked if there are still any collaborators
Source
or persons sympathetic to the United States Government on
the Cuban coast with whom the infiltrators worked.
replied that to his knowledge all those who were of
assistance have been either jailed or killed.
Espinosa vas also concerned about the
employment of CIA personnel in the Keys off of Florida
and asked the source as to why CIA would maintain personnel
in that area. Source stated he did not know unless it
was to guard against infiltration by Cuban fishing vessels.
Questioned again about his reasons for
cooperating with the CHUN, the source replied that he is
an individual completely independent of any political
belief. He said that he was initially motivated against
the regime of Fidel Castro because he had seen his parents
work hard and save for 40 years in order to afford a few
luxuries in their later lives, only to see the Cuban
Government intervene and claim possession of everything,
including their home. He further explained that it
appears the United States will never force Castro out of
Cuba but that the fact remains he is Cuban and Cuba is
his fatherland. He said he is willing to cooperate only
to the extent that his parents will receive fair treatment
from the Cuban Government.
Espinosa had information that the source was
suspected at one time by Cubans in Miami of possibly
being connected with the Cuban G-2, which information
caused a United States Government investigation. Source
replied that this was probably due to his number of
successful rens into Cuba without incident which prompted
others to suspect he had to have connections with G-2.

On one run, the source was out of contact with CIA for
ten days which added further to the possibility that he
had cither defected or was working with G-2. Most of the
rumors Vere quelled however when he submitted to & CIA
lie detector test which reculted negatively. He credited
his ability to avoid aubushes and misfortune to the experience
he had in infiltration exercises as well as extensive
CIA training.
Approximately one half hour of the meeting
between the sorce and Espinosa entatied ascertaining the
profciencies of the source in the training of acmolitions
radio operation, veaponry, seamanship, etc., which he
received from CIA. Nothing was mentioned concerning any
intentions by CHUN to utilise the source in connection
with any of his previously mentioned fields of training.
The source informed Espinosa that he had been
contacted since their last meeting by Jose Ramon Egues,
who is currently reorganizing the Vanguardia Revolucionaria
Cubana, an anti-Castro organization. The source has been
designated by Egues to lead the military faction of the
organization. It was explained to Espinosa that Egues has
goals of ultimately bombing the CHUN at New York City by
means as yet not disclosed to the source. The source was
instructed that in the future he is to spend as much time
as possible with Egues in determining that organization's
plans of action against the CMUN and Government of Cuba.
At different times throughout the meeting,
Espinosa was observed to lean back on the ground which
exposed a weapon tucked inside his trousers at the waist,
which was described by the source to be a black Waltham
9MN Automatic Pistol.
At a point of about two hours through the
interview, Espinosa took the source on foot to the Allerton
