Cover for Peter J. Di Gerveno
ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES
1. The cover for Peter J. Di Gerveno was discussed by Robert S.
Hunkeler, Chester B. Dagnillo and the undersigned on 7 and 9 November
1967. The purpose of the conversations was to determine the most
suitable cover to be used under the broad umbrella offered by
Hunkeler's various enterprises.
2. The following conclusions were reached:
3. That Di Gerveno will come to Caracas as the
representative for some of Hunkeler's sales lines.
Specifically he will be the representative for IDENTITY-1,
which is Hunkeler's marketing firm.
b. In addition to representing IDENTITY-1, generally,
he will specifically be IDENTITY-1's sales agent for IDENTITY-2;
IDENTITY-3; and IDENTITY-4 and possibly for IDENTITY-5.
3. IDENTITY-2 is the manufacturer of a wide variety of
industrial epoxy products used in the construction industry and
as anti-corrosive coatings required by most petroleum companies
in Venezuela. Hunkeler has conducted talks with IDENTITY-6, a
large local holding company engaged in a broad variety of business
enterprises. IDENTITY-6 is interested in marketing the IDENTITY-2
line. As sales agent for IDENTITY-1, Di Gerveno would also serve
as a technical advisor to IDENTITY-6, and would not interfere with
IDENTITY-6's marketing activities. Under these circumstances Di Gerveno
would enjoy a degree of immediate sponsorship by an important local
firm which should assist in the rapid solidification of his status
cover.

4.
IDENTITY-3 is a line of liquid fertilizer in which
IDENTITY-6 is also interested. However, since the local fertilizer
industry enjoys protection in the form of impert licensing restrictions,
it will take from one to two years of negotiation to determine whether
the GOV will permit the importation of this line. Di Gerveno would, in
conjunction with IDENTITY-6, represent IDENTITY-1 in the negotiations
to obtain such permission. Again, this rele would provide a degree of
sponsorship by IDENTITY-6 and would enable Di Gervene to at least meet
significant government officials. While his operational objectives
do not involve the GOV as a target, he could provide assessment and
other operational data useful against this target.
5. IDENTITY-4 produces a line of concrete block manufacturing
machinery and accessories. There little doubt that as capital
equipment, these can be imported into Venezuela--but the number of
prospective buyers is limited. Such a line would not of itself support
Di Gerveno's cover, but would be a satisfactory supplement there to
which would be useful in explaining the fact that he will not devote
his full time to any one activity--and to account for at least that
portion of his income which could not be justified on the basis of
his work on behalf of IDENTITY-2 and -3.
6. IDENTITY-5 produces wrought iron for the utility industry.
IDENTITY-1 is considering accepting representation for IDENTITY-5 on
a hemisphere wide basis. If this line is accented, and Di Gerveno
represents it locally, it will also help to enhance his status and to
account for what would normally be an unusual work pattern.
7.
We do not wish at this point to get into a detailed
discussion of financial arrangements. If, as we hope, Pi Gerveno
does make some sales, commissions will be payable to him. If under
existing regulations he could keep at least a proportion of these,
we would favor it as an incentive to work at his cover.
If not, we
have confidence that he is a weil enough disciplined professional,
to work at it in any event.
8. We would expect that the operational duties we have planned
for Di Gerveno will take about 20 hours a week. This would involve
meetings with the inside case officer; meetings with the agents;
preparation of contact reports, drafts of cables, intei reports and
dispatches, plus some time to think about his operations.
9. We would expect Di Gerveno to spend the balance of his work
week actually performing cover duties. Fis pattern cannot be neatly.
defined as four hours for cover and four hours daily for operations.
llis daily pattern will vary widely and he must retain flexibility in
order to be available when needed for operational duties. Nevertheless,
to reiterate, he will have time for cover work and will be expected to
do it.
10. Under these circumstances, we desire that he be thoroughly
trained in his cover duties and that he have a thorough knowledge of the
products he is to sell. If it takes 6 months to train in--we expect
the 6 months to be used. As part of the training, and to oren the deer
for his PCS arrival, when he has completed cover training with IDENTITY-1
through 4 (or 5), he and Hunkeler should visit Caracas together.
Di Gerveno can be introducted by liunkeler to his conrercial contacts,
they can seek office space, and, generally, lay the groundworl for
Di Gerveno's PCS arrival shortly after the exploratory trip.
11. Please keep us advised on action taker, and procress en this
proposal.
12. Just before the release of this dispatch we have learned of
Subject's death. This is a cause for real regret--but we would like to
ask Headquarters to retain this cover proposal and to seek a possible
substitute for Di Gervene who will have not only good knowledge of the
Spanish language, but sufficient commercial background to fit into the
proposed cover.

NONOFFICIAL COVER REQUEST
FOR INDIVIDUAL
To insure the most effective application of nonofficial cover, it is
essential that cover requirements be brought to the attention of Central
Cover Staff in the earliest stages of planning. As soon as it has been
determined that an agent is to be placed under nonofficial cover, either
in the United States or abroad, a meeting with a representative of
Central Cover Staff should be arranged. (When outside recruitment of
an agent for a nonofficial cover assignment is contemplated, Central
Cover Staff facilities are available to facilitate "clean" recruitments and
protect the agent against identification with CIA during the integration
period.) Initial discussions will be informal and exploratory and should
result in the elimination of unsuitable cover possibilities. Central Cover
Staff, Nonofficial Cover Branch telephone extensions are 5144 and 5122.
Following the initial discussion, and based upon it, a cover require-
ment memorandum signed by or for the operating division chief should
be submitted to Central Cover Staff. It is specifically requested that a
headquarters case officer other than the agent himself be designated
to deal with Central Cover Staff in the development of the desired non-
official cover, including the preparation of the cover requirement mem-
orandum, in order that this development may proceed on a completely
objective basis. This memorandum may be keyed to the paragraphs
numbered-below to obviate repetition.
No commitments will be made with any cover organization until
Central Cover Staff has been advised by memorandum that the proposed
cover and the agent's participation in the operation have been concurred
in by the field and/or the Chief of Operations, DD/P. Such memoranda
are to be signed by or for the division chief. Each agent proposed for
a nonofficial cover assignment is subject also to personal interview by a
designee of Chief, Central Cover Staff, for assessment as to his suit-
ability for the proposed cover. This interview, when required, will be
requested by Central Cover Staff.
At the conclusion of the discussions with the operating divisions and
discussions between representatives of Central Cover Staff and the cover
organization, two formal documents ordinarily will be prepared:
a. The first, a "Letter of Cover Instructions" addressed to the agent
will be prepared by the Central Cover Staff. It will outline exactly
the cover story to be employed and will specify what is expected
of the agent to maintain a proper relationship to the cover fa-
cility. Each item in the instructions will be discussed with the
agent and/or his case officer by the Central Cover Staff case officer,
after which the agent will be required to acknowledge the receipt
of these instructions. The branch chief concerned will also be
SECRET
14-00000

asked to indicate that nothing in the "Letter of Cover Instructions"
conflicts with instructions given the agent by the operating di-
vision.
:
›. When the cover facility is a legitimate organization rather than
an Agency-controlled mechanism, a "Letter of Understanding"
with the cover organization is prepared by Contract Personnel Di-
vision. It is the "contract" with the cover organization.
The "Letter of Understanding" and the "Letter of Cover Instructions"
I be submitted to the operating division for comments and concur-
ce before presentation, respectively, to the cover organization and
The agent for signature. Sanitized copies, in duplicate, of both the
tter of Cover Instructions" and the "Letter of Understanding" will

ention and one for transmittal to and retention by the field station
