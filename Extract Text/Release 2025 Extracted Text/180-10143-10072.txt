Memorandum for the Record:
Subject: Procurement of
Intelligence by Mrs.
Dorothy L. Hunt.
1. On 25 February 1963, I
delivered to Mr. W. Lloyd
George, Chief, FI, thermo-
fax copies of a memorandum
and a letter of transmittal
dated 18 and 20 February
respectively. Both were
prepared by Ambassador
Antonio Sarrigues for Prince
Stanislas Radziwill and
taken to the latter in
New York by Alfonso
de Borbon, ad secretary
of the Spanish Embassy
in Washington.
The purport of the
material was to enlist
the aid of Radziwill in
(a) persuading the President
to visit Madrid during his
next European trip, and
(b) conveying to the
SECRET President the views of
- 16 -

Hunt
Ambassador Sanuigues
regarding U.S. - Latin
American relations.
3. Mr. George regarded the
material too sensitive
to be handled by routine
means, and decided to
show it only to Mr.
Helms.
4. On 27 February 1963,
Mr. George telephoned
to say that he
had just shown the
material to Mr. Helms,
who speculated whether
he ought not take it to
the White House at once.
Mr. George demurred,
pointing out the sensitivity
of the source. Whereupon
Mr. Helms indicated
that nothing
should be done with
the material until Mr.
George returned from
a Near East trip and could
SECRET consider the matter
further.
