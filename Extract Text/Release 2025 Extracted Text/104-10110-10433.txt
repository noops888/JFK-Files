On the same date, Mrs. (SALLOOM), her daughter, (Patricia) and
son, George, were briefed to the effect that they should accept
any cables, letters, telegrams or telephone calls for Mrs. DAMBRUNT.
In the event any inquiries were received concerning Mrs. DAMBRUNT,
they were to advise that Mrs. DAMBRUNT was residing with them but
that she was not available at the moment. They were to determine
who was calling and the purpose of the call. If the call was from
the cable or telegraph office, Mrs. (SALLOOM) or Patricia was to call
back later as Mrs. DAMBRUNT and receive the message and request
delivery of the written cable or telegram. In the event the inquiry
was from any other source, they were to contact the Reporting Agent

The same individuals were further briefed, in general, as to
why Mrs. DAMBRUNT was ostensibly residing with them and why she was

DAMBRUNT was the mother of Eustace H. DAMBRUNT, who was being held
a prisoner by a foreign government. The mother has sent a cable

if there is anything she can do for him, and asking him to please

of reply from him.
On the following day, 18 May 1961, Dr. (SALLOOM) was contacted.

should be delivered to his address.
