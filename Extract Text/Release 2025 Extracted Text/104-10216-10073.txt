ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES
Please comment on Subject and his statements
1. The following paragraphs are quoted from an ODENVY report resulting
from an interview with Identity. The addressees are requested to comment on
the Subject's statements and to send to Headquarters information concerning the
Subject's activities in Ecuador bearing on his statements.
A. On August 29, 1960, Identity was interviewed by ODENVY at his
request. Identity related that he had just returned from a trip to Ecuador
where he had been offered a job to represent that country as an agent in
PBPRIME and he was seriously considering this offer. While in Ecuador, he
had conferred with four individuals who he believed would run the new
government which was to be sworn into office on August 31, 1960. These
persons were identified as follows: Jaime Nebot Velasco, Minister of
Development, Pedro J. Menendez Gilbert, Mayor of Guayaquil, Ecuador;
Luis Noboa, an Ecuadorean businessman; and Enrique Ponce Luque, a Senator
and partner of Noboa.
B. According to Identity, the now president of Ecuador, Jose Maria
Velasco Ibarra, has been elected to that office for the fourth time and
is an aged person. The above-listed individuals will control and operate
the Government of Ecuador with the approval of Ibarra. As a result of
his conferring with the above persons, Identity expressed the belief that
Nebot will be the strong man in the government. He described these individuals
as patriotic with a sincere desire to better the plight of the common
man in Ecuador. Identity stated that all of them are definitely pro-
PBPRIME and Nebot said that all Identity has to do is tell him what PBPRIME

desires and the Ecuadorean Government will do its best to cooperate
with PBPRIME.
C. Identity was also told that the Government of Ecuador has con-
menced negotiations with an electronics firm in Dallas, Texas, believed
by Identity to be the Continental Electronics Company, for the construction
of a 50,000 kilowatt radio station in Guayaquil. This station will be
used to combat antigovernment propaganda beamed into Ecuador from Cuba.
Nebot felt that PBPRIME could make use of this radio station. Identity
told Nebot that he believed this could be arranged.
D. It is the opinion of Identity that this is a golden opportunity
for PBPRIME to commence cooperation with a new government in a pro-PBPRIME
country. He stated that the Ecuadorean Government would be most willing
for KUBARK to utilize the above radio station; however, it would necessitate
KUBARK's paying half of the expenses for its construction. Identity
was advised that the information he had given ODENVY would be furnished
to KUBARK pursuant to his request. He desired to be contacted within a
period of ten days if KUBARK is interested in the information he had to
offer. No further action concerning this matter will be undertaken by
ODENVY.
2. ODENVY has previously reported at length on the Identity, a public
relations counsel. Identity registered as a purchasing agent for various
bureaus of the Republic of Nicaragua on 15 April 1955, on 22 July 1958, he
registered as an agent of the Israeli Military Industries, which was controlled
by the government of Israel.
3. The Identity appears to be an international businessman with special
interest in Latin American countries. He has previously frequently contacted
PBPRIME agencies on subjects he thought appropriate to bring to their attention.
A cursory check of his 201 file revealed no derogatory information.
Further information can be supplied if the field so requests.
