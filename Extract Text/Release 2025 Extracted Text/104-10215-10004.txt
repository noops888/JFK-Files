2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
SECRET
25 June 1963
MEMORANDUM FOR: Central Cover Staff
ATTENTION : Charlie Danish
SUBJECT : Ross CROZIER
REFERENCE : SAS Memorandum Dated 14 May 1963
1. Referenced memorandum requested the Subject be provided with
military cover while assigned in the Headquarters area for operational
and credit purposes in the performance of his duties with SAS. It is
understood that your office was reluctant to issue the Subject the
necessary military cover because he was physically located in a DODS
office which was under commercial cover.
2. As indicated verbally on 24 June 1963, SAS will move the
Subject out of the DODS area on 26 June. SAS has also requested suit-
able office or apartment space through the Office of Logistics from
which the Subject will operate in the future. Until this property is
acquired, the Subject will perform his duties from his home. Conse-
quently, it is requested that immediate attention be given to providing
the Subject with the necessary military cover. Refer any questions to
Q. A. LADKER, Jr., SAS/Security, ext. 5909.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Central Cover Staff
SUBJECT : Room 1-B-24 Headquarters Building
Request for Domestic Cover
REFERENCE : Form 1322, forwarded to your Office,
14 May 1963
1. It is requested that this Office be advised as
to the disposition of our request dated 14 May 1963 for
providing Mr. Ross Lester Crozier appropriate Domestic
Cover.
2. Since security requirements prohibit Mr. Crozier
from being located in the Headquarters Building, he has

"Cover" as soon as possible, for credit purposes,

appreciated.
