Page 10: Though Camp Perry, has received much publicity, there
appears no good reason to confirm the use of this facility by the
99 (SIC)
Agency. Unless we plan on officially opening Camp Perry, as a CIA
A
training facility, it should not be mentioned. (Check OTR)
Page 15: The "Phoenix Program" originated before William Colby
became DEPCORDS, COMUSMACV. Ambassador Komer started the program and
asked that Colby replace him as DEPCORDS so that there would be some
continuity in the effort to deal with criminal elements of the Viet
Cong infrastructure. It is unfair to subjectively state that the
"Operation Phoenix" was Colby's own albatross. Certainly Colby doesn't
believe this though he is receiving considerable flack from those who
would like others to believe that the whole program was one of assassina-
tion of which Colby, as head of the CIA, was in charge.
Page 39: We're still putting audio devices in coke bottles
these techniques and methods should not be discussed since we may very

all
well want to use them again in the future.
