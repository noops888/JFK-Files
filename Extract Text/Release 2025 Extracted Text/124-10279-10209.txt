Subject advised that Nina and Edistevens do a lot of entertaining
but he had never attended any of their parties. Subject stated that he
would not trust Nina Stevens as far as he could throw an elephant. Subject
stated that he had no proof but believed Nina to be a Soviet informant.
Subject advised that Aline Mosby was a newspaperwoman in
Schapiro's office. Mosby, during the past year, had been in the hospital
on several occasions and one didn't see too much of her. Subject also
advised that Mosby stuck mostly to the foreign circuit rather than the
Embassy circuit. Subject stated that one of the reasons Mosby was in
the hospital on one occasion was the fact that she had an abortion, accord-
ing to gossip.
Subject stated that another newspaperwoman in Moscow was
Priscilla Johnson. Subject advised that Johnson had the reputation of
being a fairly good reporter and one whom the Soviets kept on a month
to month visa basis. Subject indicated that it was highly possible the
Soviets had attempted to recruit Johnson as she spent a lot of time with
Soviet nationals.
Subject was queried as to whether he had ever made an unauthorized
disclosure of classified information in the Soviet Union, to which he replied
that he had not disclosed classified information as such. He stated that his
cover,, which he had used for the period in between State Department(s)
assignments, was that he was a consultant of the AEC, particularly to
the Joint Atomic Energy Intelligence Committee, composed of AEC, CIA,
State, NSA, Joint Chiefs, and the Armed Services. Subject stated that
he had indicated to individuals, when questioned, that he had done economic
research and analysis in the Soviet field and that he had done this ever
since he had first become a State Department employee. Subject stated
that among others he had discussed this with Ray Hutchins, his counter-
part in the British Embassy.(5)
Subject was asked for his itinerary on his return trip to the United
States. Subject stated that he had long planned to come home via the Far
East and it was a well publicized plan. He stated that when he left Moscow
he stayed over in Delhi for a week to see if there were any objections from
Headquarters as to his itinerary. He stated that when he received no in-
structions to the contrary, he returned to the United States via his previously
announced plans and the differences in fares being borne by him.
