WEEK. (SOURCE COMMENT. MAJOR LONG DID NOT KNOW THE ORIGINATOR OR THE ADDRESSEE
OF THE INTERCEPTED DOCUMENT, NOR DID HE STATE TO WHICH VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT
AGENCY GENERAL XUAN HAD REPORTED.)
MAJOR LONG ALSO REVEALED THAT AN MSS AGENT PENETRATION OF THE VC OF
UNTESTED RELIABILITY HAD REPORTED ON 1 AUGUST THAT HIS VC SUPERIOR IN CHAU HIEP
(THIRTY KILOMETERS WEST OF SAIGON) HAD INSTRUCTED HIM ON 31 JULY TO BE ALERT
FOR A COUP, AND TO MEET HIS VC SUPERIOR IN SAIGON FOUR HOURS AFTER THE COUP
BEGAN.
MAJOR LONG ALSO STATED THAT A HAND GRENADE HAD EXPLODED IN THE GO
VAP AREA OF SAIGON ON THE NIGHT OF 1 AUGUST INJURING SEVEN VIETNAMESE WOMEN
AND CHILDREN. (SOURCE COMMENT THE RELEVANCE OF THE EXPLOSION TO A COUP
ATTEMPT IS NOT CLEAR, BUT MAJOR LONG BELIEVED THAT THE EVENTS MIGHT BE
CONNECTED.)
THE PRESIDENTIAL SECURITY SERVICE (SES) HAD INTERCEPTED CODED RADIO
MESSAGES ON 1 AUGUST ON UNUSUAL FREQUENCIES. THE TEXT OF THE MESSAGES WHEN
DECODED WERE IN VIETNAMESE AND FRENCH AND STATED THAT A COUP WOULD OCCUR ON
THE NIGHT OF 1-2 AUGUST. ARVN UNITS HAVE BEEN ALERTED IN THE SAIGON AREA.
FIELD COMMENT CHAU IS CONSIDERED TO BE A FAIRLY RELIABLE SOURCE,
WHO HAS PREVIOUSLY STATED THAT OF ALL THE ARVN OFFICERS GENERAL DUONG VAN MINH
WAS THE MOST LIKELY TO LEAD A COUP ATTEMPT. GENERAL MINH HAS BEEN A VOCAL CRITIC
OF THE DIEM REGIME INSOFAR AS DIEM'S EFFICACY AGAINST THE VC IS CONCERNED.

IS KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN DISSATISFIED WITH HIS PRESENT ASSIGNMENT AND TO HAVE
HARBORED RESENTMENTS AGAINST DIEM FOR ALLEGED SLIGHTS. DESPITE THE FACT THAT
DIEM PROMOTED HIM FROM COLONEL TO BRIGADIER GENERAL SEVERAL YEARS AGO. MAJOR
LONG HAS EXHIBITED PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE IN HIS PRESENT POSITION.
FIELD COMMENT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ALL OF THE INFORMATION PROCEEDED
FROM A SINGLE SOURCE OR FROM TWO SOURCES AND THE VARIATION IN DETAIL WAS IN THE
ORAL ACCOUNTS OF DIFFERENT SOURCES. THE GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM (GVN) CENTRAL
INTELLIGENCES ORGANIZATION (CIO) WAS UNAWARE OF ANY POSSIBLE COUP SHORTLY AFTER
MIDNIGHT ON 1-2 AUGUST. HOWEVER, AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME TIME, THE NORMAL
PRESIDENTIAL GUARD HAD ALREADY BEEN REINFORCED AND POLICE CHECK POINTS ALSO
SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN REINFORCED. GIVEN THE ADVANCE ALERT BY THE GVN MILITARY
AND SECURITY ELEMENTS, IT IS PROBABLE THAT ANY INTENDED COUP WOULD BE ABORTIVE.
FIELD COMMENT
AT 10200 ON 2 AUGUST SAIGON WAS QUIET AND THERE WERE NO SIGNS APPARENT
OF ANY COUP ATTEMPT, EXCEPT FOR THE ALERT OF SOME OF THE GVN ELEMENTS STATED IN
PARA 10.
FIELD COMMENT THE INTERCEPTION OF A PLAIN TEXT VC RADIO MESSAGE REFERRED
TO IN PARA FIVE IS NOT CONVINCING AND RAISES THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE VC MIGHT
BE ENGAGED IN A CONFUSION MANEUVER. SES' CAPABILITY TO INTERCEPT AND DECODE A
MESSAGE IN THE SAME DAY, AS REPORTED IN PARA. NINE, IS QUESTIONABLE.
