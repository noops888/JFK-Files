THE PRESIDENT'S
INTELLIGENCE CHECKLIST
ISSUED BY THE
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
21 NOVEMBER 1963
TOP SECRET

1.
Iraq
2. Indonesia
a.
The new 21-man cabinet ap-
pears to be a coalition of Arab
nationalist elements including four
members of the moderate wing of the
Baath Party. The regime is still
dominated by the military, with eight
cabinet posts.
b. The new prime minister,
Tahir Yahya, is sympathetic to the
Baath Party, and both the Baathists
and the Egyptians feel they can
trust him.
c. The political affiliation
of eight of the new ministers is
not known, but the key interior post
is in the hands of an anti-Baathist
nationalist.
a. Defense Minister Nasution
has been ordered by Sukarno to make
conciliatory statements on Malaysia
while on his trip abroad.
b. The Dutch chargé who re-
ported this explained that Nasution
was chosen for this job because
Sukarno was irritated with the ultra-
tough line the defense minister has
taken.

3. Congo
c.
The chargé has no informa-
tion on the motives behind this
switch. Our embassy thinks it may
be a move to pave the way for explora-
tory talks by Foreign Minister Suband-
rio at Bangkok with his Thai and
Philippine counterparts. It may also
be meant to provide a more recep-
tive attitude for Nasution's visit
here.
d. Our embassy thinks Nasution
went in for his Malaysia sabre rat-
tling on Sukarno's orders, or at
the very least, with the president's
tacit support. Sukarno may feel
Nasution has stolen some of his
thunder.

a.
Adoula still did not get
around to announcing the expulsion
of all Soviet and Czech embassy per-
sonnel yesterday. However, his
10 people managed on Tuesday afternoon
to corral and hog-tie the Soviet
counselor and press attaché before
they could eat-up all the incrimin-
ating papers in their possession.

b. The Russians are now being
held at Ndolo prison. The Congolese
surete says the seized papers include,
(among other things, minutes of a
"liberation committee" meeting of op-
position politicians in Brazzaville,
and a document showing Soviet pay-
ments to this group.

4. Ethiopia-
Congo
c.
The Belgian ambassador
thinks these papers are probably
genuine. He says the Russians have
made the mistake of underrating the
Congolese and have stumbled into a
surete trap.
d. The Congolese also picked
up two Czech diplomats but have since
released them. This morning they
arrested the correspondent of the
Soviet news agency.
a. Haile Selassie is planning
to withdraw all Ethiopian troops
6/ to the commander of his ground forces.
1 / from the Congo in January, according
b. The two battalions of
Ethiopians provide the guts of the
UN operation. They had been slated
to stay until June and are likely to
be very difficult to replace.
c. The Emperor reportedly.
ordered the withdrawal on grounds
that the troops are urgently needed
in Ethiopia, particularly in view
of the Soviet military accord with
Somalia.
d. Our ambassador has asked
to see the Emperor, as well as the
prime minister and foreign minister,
to press for reconsideration.

5. Yemen
6. Turkey
a.
Military activity has
slackened but the stalemate continues.
b. Egypt still has about 32,000
troops in Yemen, and Saudi Crown
Prince Faysal believes Nasir will
not withdraw any significant number
of them before 4 January when the
extension of the disengagement agree-
ment expires.
c. Faysal is preparing to re-
sume aid to the royalists at that
time; he is stockpiling quantities
of arms and ammunition along the
border.
(Includes INTERCEPTS)
a. The opposition Justice
Party, heir of the old Menderes re-
gime, appears to have won a victory
in Sunday's nationwide local elec-
tions on the basis of incomplete re-
turns.
b. The collapse of Prime Min-
ister Inonu's coalition government
appears increasingly likely. Though
a new coalition may be formed, there
will be considerable resistance to
the retention of Inonu as prime min-
ister.

c. Justice Party members will
be putting on pressure for early
national parliamentary elections.
However their party leaders do not
believe the Turkish military, which
ousted Menderes in 1960, would per-
mit them to take over if they won
new elections.
d. They will probably try to
work out some rapprochement with the
armed forces.

NOTES
A. Cuba The U-2 which flew yesterday's mission over
Cuba crashed while returning, about 40 miles north
of Key West. Air and sea rescue craft were sent to
the scene. An air rescue unit sighted an unopened
parachute, a life raft, and oil slick in the crash
area. The pilot is presumed lost. There is no in-
dication that the plane was attacked.
B. Berlin Local East German troops acting without
higher authority appear to have been responsible
for turning high powered searchlights on pilots tak-
ing off from West Berlin's Tempelhof airfield on
14-16 November. There were five such incidents. A
message of 16 November instructed border guard ele-
ments to discontinue such acts. There have been no
further incidents reported since.

lapse, The Albanians are on record as preferring
to eat grass rather than to kowtow to the West, but
they are not above eating Chinese wheat acquired from
Western_sources.

D. Iran-USSR The Soviet Union's timing seems to be
off in Iran. Government sources have reported that
a twin engined plane was shot down in Iranian ter-
ritory restenday by Soviet jet fighters who violated
Iranian air space. The Iranians say that the plane
was on a photographic mission in connection with the

government's land reform drive. The pilot was injured
and his two passengers were killed. The incident
comes at a time when Soviet President Brezhnev is
visiting Tehran. He addressed a joint session of
parliament today.
E. Venezuela Police seem to have restored order in
に
downtown-Caracas, but terrorism contimes elsewhere.
The slum district of Caracas to which the terrorists
retreated is under virtual martial law. Among other
things, the Dupont paint warehouse at Maracaibo was
set afire_and_totally destroyed.
F. World Peace Council The WPC meeting in Warsaw next
Thursday may wind up in another free-for-all. The
Chinese Communist delegation, although not intent on
disrupting the conference, plans to attack the WPC
president's report given to a committee meeting in
Vienna last September. The Japanese delegates plan
to give general support to the Chinese and will try
to forestall a vote on the Moscow test ban treaty.

b. Arif has plans to announce
the make-up of his cabinet today.
It will probably contain some "mild"

c. He permitted Syrian strong-
man Hafiz and Michel Aflaq, the
founder of the Baath Party, who were
caught in Baghdad by the coup, to
fly back to Damascus yesterday after
the Syrian radio suddenly stopped
vilifying the newest Iraqi regime.
d. Arif and his colleagues
obviously hope to reach an under- -
standing with the Syrian regime. We
doubt very much if they are interested,
however, in the meaningful political
and military unity the previous re-
gime was aiming for.
e. An intercepted message in-
Nouhauser, 1906 dicates that Syrian army units, now
in Iraq, are getting ready to go home.
f. The retention of Baathists
in positions of power in Baghdad also
tends to ease the threat to the party
in Syria.

frustrate the presidential election
(1 December) continues.
b. An illegal transmitter was
heard yesterday in Caracas calling
for a 48-hour general strike and
urging listeners to arm themselves
against the Betancourt government.
c. Roving bands of Communist-
led terrorists sought to enforce the
generally unsuccessful strike with
gunfire. There were at least nine
deaths (some reports go as high as
19). Guerrilla activity in rural
areas is also being stepped up.
d. The government has jailed
an added 200 extremists in the wake
of yesterday's violence and plans
are afoot to detain 1,500 more.
e. The army is being held in
reserve in the Caracas area.

b. He has been visiting provin-
cial cities to "explain" the military
takeover and receive expressions of
loyalty. He has continued to spread
the idea that the coup was largely
his own doing.
c. Dinh has directed provincial
chiefs to submit to him daily reports
on local politics. (INTERCEPTS)

other members of the regime are
squabbling about who should be in
the "council of sages" and what it

a. We have picked up further
details on the surface-to-surface
missile system which a French firm
is developing for the Israelis.
b. The firm, Marcel Dassault,
is to produce and test fire 25 mis-
siles between July 1964 and July
1965. An actual production contract
for perhaps 250 missiles will be
drawn up late in the period if all
goes well.

c. Design requirements call
for the delivery of a 1,600-pound
warhead to a maximum range of 300
miles with a CEP slightly in excess
of half a mile. A conventional war-
head would not make military sense
under these specifications.
a. Pamphlets and posters
bitterly lampooning Nasir, espe-
cially for his involvement in Yemen
and Algeria, have appeared on the
streets of Cairo and Suez.
b. Such public expression of
anti-Nasir sentiment is highly
unusual.
c. It is still in a very low
key, however, and there is no sign
of organized opposition.
d. We do not consider Nasir
to be in any immediate danger of
overthrow, though he could be forced
to modify unpopular policies if the
discontent spreads.

a. The return last week of
Vice President Lechin, who has been
on ice as Bolivia's ambassador in
Rome, will heat things up in La Paz.
b. The city has already wit-
nessed four minor demonstrations
which Embassy La Paz attributes to
left-wingers encouraged by Lechin's
presence.
c. Lechin, who has ambitions
to replace President Paz, intends
to tour the country to rally his
political forces, now in disarray
as a result of some astute moves
by Paz.
d. If Lechin decides after
these soundings to come out openly
against the president, he will try
to arrange a series of strikes early
next year to point up his strength.
a. Sihanouk may have finally
painted himself into a corner on US
aid.
b. He has followed up yester-
day's emotional public renunciation
with an official request to our embassy
for talks on the subject.

NOTES
A. Congo A clandestine source tells us that Adoula
will finally announce this morning the expulsion of
all personnel of the Soviet and Czech embassies.
19Now This move has been hanging fire ever since security
Moscow's 1718 officials turned up evidence several weeks ago im-
2010 plicating personnel of these embassies in antigovern-
CIB
ment activities. The Congolese ambassador in Moscow
has been directed to destroy his classified files.
B. USSR A new series of extended range missile tests
seems to be upcoming. Three Soviet range instrumen-
tation ships left Petropavlovsk nine days ago and
are apparently headed for the more distant Pacific
impact area, 6,500 miles from Tyuratam. There has
so far been no announcement closing the area. (INTER-

but it is possible that as many Soviets went out as
came in.

There were, the ambassador notes, "only six wounded

F. Japan Ikeda does not appear to be in any particular
trouble in tomorrow's elections. The long-range trend
toward the left in popular vote will probably be ap-
parent, but Ikeda's Liberal Democratic Party should
retain a safe majority in the next Diet. The leftists
have tried to turn rising prices and last week's twin
disasters into election ammunition, but without
marked success.
