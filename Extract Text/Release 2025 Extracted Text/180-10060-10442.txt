Assassination Records Review Board
Final Determination Notification
AGENCY: HSCA
RECORD NUMBER : 180-10060-10442
RECORD SERIES : STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS
AGENCY FILE NUMBER :
December 8, 1995
Status of Document:
Postponed in Part
Number of releases of previously postponed information: 18
Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors
including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the
absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.
Number of Postponements: 6
Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.
Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could
reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of
privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Mr. Hitchcock is a very bright young man. He
graduated from the Georgetown University Law Center in
May, 1975. He then clerked for a Connecticut Supreme
Court judge for a year. He did part-time work for
Representative McKinney and is now working with a small
Washington, D.C. law firm making $200 a week.
I was impressed with his willingness to work hard
and his ability to fend off pointed questions.
I recommend we take him.

Dear Rick:
Con Hitchcock is very interested in working on the committee's
legal staff. I had hoped to convince him to work on my staff,
but he declined. I recommend him very highly. His work is superior
and he has a reputation as a tireless worker.
I would hope an interview could be arranged for Monday, December 6.
Thanks for your assistance.
Sincerely,
Szer

MEMORANDUM
TO:
Tom Lambeth
FROM:
Robert J. Lehner
DATE:
May 26, 1977
SUBJECT: Con Hitchcock
This is to request a salary adjustment from $15,000
to $20,000 per year for Con Hitchcock. Mr. Hitchcock was
hired in December at a salary of $15,000. The thought
of the then Staff Director and Chief Counsel was that after
members of the staff were working here for a period of time
and we were able to evaluate their work, salary adjustments
would be made. Unfortunately those salary adjustments were
never made because of the delay in reconstituting and re-
budgeting
the Committee.
Mr. Hitchcock graduated from Law School in 1975. The
only other attorney on the King Task Force that graduated
that year was Sheila Jackson Lee. Her salary is $23,000
per year.
Mr. Hitchcock has demonstrated a quick ability to
assimilate factual situations, gives insightful legal
analysis of those situations and writes cogently in these
areas. He is a definite asset to our team and one of the
brightest people we have on the staff.
I had recommended to Al Lewis this same adjustment. Mr.
Lewis agreed and was prepared to make that recommendation to
the Committee.
For the above reasons, I hereby recommend Mr. Hitchcock's
salary adjustment be made forthwith.
