The contract for Raymond H. GERENDE expires on 30 September

be extended for one year, and that GERENDE be granted a salary
increase from $6,000 to $6,500 per annum.
GERENDE received his last salary raise on 1 August 1963,
from $5,500 to $6,000. lie was first placed under contract on
1 October 1955 at $3,600.
There are sufficient funds in the LIEMPTY Project to cover
this salary increase, and GERENDE's local cover job can logically
cover this additional income.

DATES
LOCATION
AGENCY TASK
GERENDE was recruited in March 1955, just prior to his graduation from
the Mexico City College. He was trained as a member of a surveillance
team, and was also used as an investigator to collect operational data
on persons and organizations of interest to the Station. He quickly
demonstrated a capacity for leadership and at one time was leader of
the team.
He was also used as a basehouse keeper in an audio operation and
processor of tapes. He exalled in this type of work because of his bi-
lingual Spanish/English facility, and, more importantly, due to his diver-
sified experience in clandestine operations which permited him to spot
operational leads.
Since 1958 his primary use has been as main cutout/principal agent
to a group of photographic basehouses targeted against the Soviet Embassy,
and one mobile photographic truck. He processes the raw photographic take
and services the majority of the accomodation addresses used by the
Station. He has contributed significantly to the AMROD operation
He performs all his tasks in a professional manner. He is well suited
to intelligence work, and plans to make KUBARK his career. The Station
depends heavily on him because of his knowledge of Mexico, and his mobility
as a Mexican. He works full time for KUBARK; cover company requires very
little time.
In case of "New Hire" give a personality assessment in terms of
capability, attitude, and projected suitability; state names of
Division personnel who have interviewed him; give account of his
performance in current non-Agency job.

1. Station Mexico City fully agrees with Headquarters evaluation of Subject as
a "valuable long term asset with stay behind potential." In order to place the matter
of the 2,100 pesos in the apropriate frame of reference it is felt that a few back-
ground points should be noted.
In Jemiary 1956 the LIHMTY/LILYRIC basehouse was set up and placed in operation
in a site which provided visual coverage of the LDERICK installation. A deposit of
three months rent was made per tems of the rental contract at that time (2,100 pesos.)
In April 1961 the building in which LIEMPTY/LILYRIC is located was sold by the owner.
Normally the rental deposit wouli have been transferred to the new comer as part of
the sale transaction. However, approximately three months after the transfer of the
property to the new oner, the rental deposit was returned to the basehouse operator,
LIEMPTY-13. The deposit was then returned to GERENDE. GERENDE did not inform the
then LIALTY case officer nor the present case officer of the retim of the LEMPTY/
LILYRIC deposit. This 2,100 pesos continued to be carried on the station books as
en outstanding operational advance charged to GRANDE. GERODE used part of this
2,100 pesos to make loans to two sub-agents (LITY-6 ani LIMTY-9.) It is probably
that he also used some of this on ocassion for his own purposes.
On 16 October 1963 OERENDE returned the 2,100 pesos to the case officer and the
Station has adjusted its books to reflect the return of this money. CEREDE noted
at the time of the return that he had this money intact but did not know how to go
about returning it so long after having received it. This is the same as he stated at
the time of the LCFLUTTER interview. GERENDE was obviously impressed with his inability
to "beat" the LCFIUTTER. He was sincerely remorseful when talking to the case officer

about the incident and has twice stated that nothing of this nature would happen again.
With the reality of future LCFLUUTTER tests set firmly in O-RENDE's mind, it is believed
that he will not attempt any such action again.
As to what can be done of a positive nature (other than periodic re-LCPUTTER) to
prevent recurrence it must be noted that GRANDE kept apart the 2.100 pesos which were
really still charged to him and the Station had no way of knowing that the norey had
been returned to his by the basehousekeeper. Only when the close coan of the LIO/
LILYRIC baschouse would be effected would the Station expect to have the rental deposit
returned. Until such time the deposit would remain charged to GEREDE. The only way
to completely safeguard against this type of action would be for the case officer to
meet directly with the basehouse keepers, thereby eliminating GERADE from the operation
and causing unacceptable security risks. It is believed that periodic LCFLUTTER of
GERENDE is the best insurance against a similar occurence in the future.
As to GERENDE's regular operational revolving fund, irregularities have never
been discovered in his handling of these funds. Cash counts are conducted by the
case officer to control the unspent portion of the revolving fund by comparison with
accountings (receipts) GRENDE cakes every two weeks. GANDE's revolving fund is
kept at the minimun asount consistant with efficient conduct of the operation for which
GERENDE is responsible.
The "other false claims" GERENDE admitted making involved occasional use of his
vehicle for personal driving while entering all receipts for gas on his KUBARK
accountings. Station does not consider this a major problem. If GJONDE used his
car for only operational employment any hostile surveillance of him would be relatively
easy (1.e., surveilling only when he is using his QP vehicle) and it is believed that
latitude must be allowed in this area for indigenous agents.
2. In the area of OERENDE's morale and his statement that he "is not being
utilized to his full potential" the Station is as fully concerned as Headquarters. It
should be noted however, that GRENDE has never written the report setting forth what
he thinks he can do and when prolded on this has stated that he had been thinking about
what additional work he could assume and that he "just does not know". The reason he
gives is he does not know what else is being done in the operations area other than that
to which he is already exposed. Additional operational work is assigned to GERENDE
when this can be done securely and taking into account compartmentation of operations.
An example of this was his introduction to the AMROD operation. Station is reluctant
to expose O-R-IDE to additionel operations only for the purpose of Improving his morale"
since he already has considerable knowledge of many Station past and going operations.
The Station appreciates Headquarters comments on the results of OERENDE'S LCFLUTTER
and will make every effort to determine the best possible utilization of GERENDE in
the future.
