OVERFLYING RUSSIA
153
The next thing we tried was something called a Salisbury
screen, a metallic grid applied to the airplane's undercarriage
in the hope of deflecting incoming radar beams, but it worked
only at some frequencies and altitudes and not at others.
Kelly thought it was more practical to try special iron fer-
rite paints that would absorb a radar ping rather than
bounce it back to the sender. The paints were moderately ef-
fective but inhibited heat dissipation through the airframe's
outer skin and we experienced overheating engine problems.
But the paint lowered the radar cross section by one order of
magnitude, so we decided to give it a try. We called these
specially painted airplanes "dirty birds" and shipped the first
one out for flight testing in April 1957. Our test pilot, Bob
Sieker, took the U-2 up to over. seventy thousand feet and
suddenly, radioed that he was experiencing rapid airframe
heat buildup. Moments later his engine blew out and the face-
plate blew off Bob's oxygen mask as his pressure suit in-
stantly inflated. The U-2 dove straight down and crashed. It
took us three days to locate the wreckage and Bob's body. An
autopsy revealed that above seventy thousand feet he had
suffered acute hypoxia and lost consciousness in only ten
seconds. The culprit that killed him was a defective faceplate
clasp that cost fifty cents.
The CIA was so desperate to buy time for these Soviet over-
flights that Bissell got Kelly to sequester four of our test flight
engineers and have them write a bogus flight manual for a. U-2
twice as heavy as ours and with a maximum altitude of only
fifty thousand feet that carried only scientific weather gear in
its bay. The manual included phony instrument panel photos
with altered markings for speed, altitude, and load factor
limits. Four copies were produced and then artificially aged
with grease, coffee stains, and cigarette burns. How or if the
agency got them into Soviet hands only Mr. B knew, and he
never told.

Questions for Follow-up DO Records Briefing
April 1, 1997
P.4
1. At what point did the DDP begin to keep records of destroyed records? For
example, in a Cold Warrior footnote, Tom Mangold reports that as any of Angleton's
files were destroyed, "a complete record was carefully maintained about what had been
done. (George) Kalaris signed off on every file and the DCI's office was notified."
(p. 143) Where are these records?
2. Could an archival search be run on specific topics for retired records at the CIA's
Record's Center? Perhaps an ARRB staffer could be present during the search to review
the abstracts and to suggest other fields or topics to be searched?
3. Could a crypt search for records containing relevant crypts be run through
cryptographic reference? How would queries need to be framed and stated?
i
4. Why is it so difficult to develop a list for all personnel (official, contract,
administrative, or TDY) assigned to the post referenced in RIF 104-10065-10199 from
1959-1964?
5. We have been working to identify all technical and surveillance operations in and on
the Cuban and Soviet consulates and embassies in Mexico City between September 1
and December 1, 1963. How can we frame a search query to determine if we have a
comprehensive and complete list of all operations at that time?
6. How can a search query be framed to document all electronic take produced by the
Mexico City Station in the immediate wake of the assassination (the first month) and
during the period of Oswald's visit? How can we verify that what exists in the
Sequestered Collection represents all records of the technical production that was
available at the time of the assassination? If additional records or original production
still exists, where would it be stored or filed? What searches could be conducted to
retrieve any additional records? If such electronic take has been destroyed, do records
exist of the destruction?
7. Could you describe the process by which operational funds are proposed, approved,
received, and distributed (circa 1963). What funding and disbursement records exist?
How are they organized? How should a request be formulated to institute a reasonable
search of these records?
1

P.5
8. We have seen DDP monthly operational reports which contain information on the
allocation/distribution of operational funds. Are there other DDP records which would
reflect how certain projects utilized their funding? How are these records organized?
How should a search query be framed?
9. Various open sources have linked the CIA to various journalists and publishing
companies during the 1960's. How should a query be framed to search for connections
between the Agency and journalists or publishing companies?
10. Did the Agency have any relationship, projects, or contacts with publishing houses
during the time of the assassination and in the aftermath of the Warren Commission?
How would a search be formulated to determine whether or not the Agency had a
relationship with any of the same publishing houses that were also publishing books
about the assassination?
11. How would a query be framed to search for files on any office or person dealing
with organized crime and Cuba? How should a request be formulated to institute a
reasonable search on this topic?
12. Is there a comprehensive record or list detailing the identities of individuals on the
Interagency Source Register? How are these records organized? How can a search
query be framed to ascertain whether or not a particular individual appears in the
Register.
13. How could a search query be framed to ascertain whether or not a particular
individual was given access to classified information by DCD (then OO)? What kind of
files are assembled in the process of clearing non-Agency contacts/sources for access to
classified information?
14. ARRB's Request for Additional Information and Record No. CIA-13, dated
November 1, 1996, contained the following questions:
A.
What forms of backchannel communications were there between the
Mexico City Station (including the COS), JMWAVE, or Headquarters
during 1963? By "backchannel" we mean, inter alia, any administrative,
senior staff, or restricted access communications, or any written or
electronic communications other than regular cables or dispatches (of the
type included in the JFK Collection).
B.
Were there, in fact, any backchannel communications between the Mexico
City Station (including the COS), JMWAVE, or Headquarters during the
time periods 27 Sept - 16 Oct 1963 and 22 Nov - 30 Nov 1963?

C.
To the extent that there were any backchannel communications for the
time periods 27 Sept - 16 Oct 1963 and 22 Nov - 30 Nov. 1963 (other than
those currently contained in the JFK Collection), please make such records
available for review.
Why has it been so difficult to answer these questions?
15. ARRB's Request for Additional Information and Record No. CIA-14, dated
December 23, 1996, documented our request for the annual or biannual Station reports
for Mexico City Station for 1963 and 1964. Why has it been so difficult to provide these
reports?
16. The attached Agency document released in 1996 contains the paragraph:
11. A memorandum marked only for file, 16 March 1967, signed M.D.
Stevens, says that J. Monroe SULLIVAN, #280207, was granted a covert
security approval on 10 December 1962 so that he could be used in Project
QKENCHANT. (Clay) Shaw has # 402897-A.
What do these numbers mean? What does the "A" at the ends of Shaw's number
signify? Do the files identified by these numbers still exist? Why was Sullivan granted
a covert security approval?
17. During the period 1959-1963, what was the purpose or goal of QKENCHANT?
18. Under what circumstances were non-agency employees given covert security
clearances for the QKENCHANT project?
19. Did Clay Shaw receive a covert security approval for the QKENCHANT project?
Why was one needed? Did Clay Shaw receive covert security clearances for any
project other than QKENCHANT
20. What did Clay Shaw do within the QKENCHANT project?
21. Do records exist to account for the disposition of all files on Clay Shaw?
22. Did Howard Hunt have any involvement with the QKENCHANT project prior to
1964?
23. Did J. Monroe Sullivan have any involvement with the QKENCHANT project prior
to 1964?

SUBJECT: Clay L.YEHAW (201-813493).
1. Subject was born on 17 March 1913 in New Orleans,
Louisiana.
2. Standard background information on Subject
(parents, marital status, records of education and
employment, etc.) is lacking because SHAW was a contact
of the Domestic Contact Service.
3. Traces on Subject have been run in RID/Main
Index, the index of the Office of Security and the
Central Cover Staff. The first showed only a 1951 FBI
interview with SHAW about a former employee of the New,
Orleans International Trade Mart. The second showed
that 00/Contacts Division had requested a name trace:
about 1949 and that the check of FBI records then con-
ducted was negative, Central Cover Staff had no record.
4. Some of the 00-B reports based on SHAW'S
reporting are on hand. They are the following. (It
is noted that the source description identifies the
'source by job title.)
a.
00-8 47958, 26 March 1952, concerns
a letter written to the public relations
director of the International Trade
Mart by one Dr. Jutta SCHALLER, a trade
consultant to the Bonn Government. The
letter is a follow-up of discussions held
in Now Orleans during December 1951. The
letter said that Soviet production and
export trado were being advertised and

SHAW to him. J.. Monroe SULLIVAN, executive director of
the San Francisco World Trade Center, told the Associated
Press that SHAW was in San Francisco and touring the
Canter with him on the day of the assassination. SHAW,
now retired, was formerly the managing director of the
International Trade Mart in New Orleans. He is 54 years
old. Ramsey Clark, U.S. Attorney General, said that the
FBI had investigated SHAW late in 1963. "On the evidence
that the FBI has, there was no connection found" with the
assassination.
7. Memorandum No. 84-67, 3 March 1967, from Chief,
Now Orleans Office, to Director, Domestic Contact Service,
re SHAW.
a.
The first contact of the New Orleans office
of the DCS with Clay SHAW occurred in
December 1948. A nama check request was
returned "no info" on 23 March 1949. SHAW
was contacted by Mr. Hunter Leake of the
New Orleans office saven times in 1949,
twice in 1950, five times in 1951, nine
times in 1952, once in 1953, twice in 1954,
twice in 1955, and twice in 1956. SHAW
is the source of eight 00-B reports sub-
mitted by the New Orleans office. At one
tima ho had the "Y" number 145.1. The
last contact took place on 25 May 1956/
On 23 January 1967 Jack S. MARTIN phoned
the New Orleans office, said that he was
working on an important undercover deal
for. Garrison and Detective Louis IVON,
and was calling at IVON's request. He was
culling to ask the head of the CIA office
to telephone IVON on his unlisted number.
No such call was made. The writer, Lloyd
A. Ray, asks that the General Counsel be
informed and that he provide advice.
8. Undated and unsigned memorandum (probably
produced by CI/R & A). The following additional infor-
mation was provided by the New Orleans office of DCS.

Since 25 May 1956 Mr. Hunter Leake had seen SHAW casually,
by chance, in various downtown New Orleans restaurants,
and greetings were exchanged. The last such casual
encounter was just before SKAW's retirement in 1965.
9. On 7 March 1967 Pravda published an article

CIA made use of the services of Clay SHAW for CIA's own

assassination conspiracy. It says SHAW spent "some years"
in Roma as a World Trade Canter leader. It claims that
the Center was a cover for financing anti-Communist activity.
CIA gave directives to SHAW. The World Trade Canter was
a branch of "Permidax" (sic), "which the newspapers in
Switzerland openly accused of 'criminal operations'...."
(Comments It appears that all of the Pravda charges ara
untrue, except that there was a CIA-SHAW relationship. So

No relationship to the Garrison investigation
appears hore. A report on "Parmidex", a
Swiss corporation with principal offices
in Rome, is also in the file because the
World Trade Center and Permidex are

here which relates significantly to the
case Garrison is trying to build in New

He was subpoenaad by Garrison's office
on 1 March 1967. According to his friends,
his questioners did not advise him of his
rights. They told him they had avidence
of a meeting with FERRIE and OSWALD.
There was a fuss and SIJAW was arrested
and booked on conspiracy to murder JPK.
That night Garrison's man raided SHAW's
apartment and confiscated whips, 'chains,
a black net cap, a cape and hood. RUSSO
told reporters that he did not know Clay

Mr. CHAYES. No; I think in each case it will depend so much on the situation
with the particular person. If a person comes in and he is very agitated or
something of that kind, it might dictate a totally different approach than a differ
ent kind of thing.
Mr. DULLES. Wouldn't it be useful though to give-I don't want to suggest
what the Secretary of State should do in this, but in the light of this experi-
ence, would there not be some benefit possibly in giving people in the field the
result of the experience gained in this particular case?
Mr. CELAYKS. Well, the general approach, and other matters related to it,
are touched on in orientation courses for consular officers and no on. I think
as I look on Consul Snyder's actions, that he behaved very much like a respon-
sible Foreign Service officer.
:
That happened long before I was in the Department, so I can say that
without any involvement. But it seemed to me that he did just what he
should have done, despite the unfortunate aftermath. And it shows to me, at
least, that the training and orientation that these people are getting is right, is
serviceable, and they are able to handle these situations as they come in..
Mr, Dora. I realize that you ought not to prescribe hard and fast rules,
that there is a broad range of discretion that should be exercised here. But I
Inst raise the question as to whether a good deal of experience basn't been gained
in this case in that very field.
Mr. OHAYER. Well, it may very well be that more attention to that particular
aspect should be given in the orientation courses and so on. Those things
tend to reflect what is hot at the moment you know, and if you haven't had
trouble with something for a pretty long time, it tenda maybe not to get
mentioned..
Representative FORD. If Oswald had persisted that day, October 81, in de
manding the form that is a prerequisite under your definition for renunciation,
would Snyder have been required to give it to him and permit him to sign it?
Mr. CHAYES. I think if it had been in ordinary office hours when the con-
silate was open for business, and if Snyder was satisfied that he was competent,
that Oswald was competent, he would have to give him the form, yes, sir.
Representative Forn. Does Snyder. have the authority to make a determina-
tion of competency?
Mr. CHAYES. No; he doesn't have the authority to make a determination of
competence, and I suppose it is possible at some point to get the issue tried in
court. But I think a consular officer would probably be acting within his
discretion if he saw sombody who was drunk or raving or something and just
said, "Well, I am not going to give you this until I am sure that your action is
your act." After all, when the consul accepts the cath, be is certifying that it
is the act of the person in a meaningful sense, and so if he thought that the
person was incompetent, I think he would bave discretion not to give the oath.
But I put that far aside because in the particular case bere, Mr. Enyder made it
perfectly clear that he had no reason to doubt that Oswald was fully competent.
And so it Oswald had been there at a time when the office was open, or had
returned at a time when the office was open, and had persisted in his demand,
I think Snyder would have been under an obligation to give him the form.
Representative Foun. The only technical reasori or basla upon which Enyder
could have denled Oswald the right that day was the fact that it wAB OL &
Saturday, a non-working-hour period of the Embassy.
Mr. CHATES. Yes; I think he had every right to try to dissuade him, or per-
suade him not to act or persuade bim to think it over and come back the next
day. But if after all of that Oswald still had said "But I want to do it now"
and if the office was open for business, then I think he would have bad to do it.
Mr. DULLES. I think it might be useful if it has not beeri done to introduce
at this point as an exhibit the form of oath of remunciation.. Here is the for
malized oath and I think it would be well to have this in our records unless
it is already in our records.
Representative Forn. I agree.
Mr. COLEMAN. No; it isn't. Could we say it will be marked as Commission
Exhibit No. 955 and place this sticker on that page, photostat it and then just
send it hast
(Commission Exhibit No. 965 was marked for Identification and received in
evidenca)
Representative Foen. When Oswald came back on November 8, I believe, which
was a regular working day
Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. Commissioner, he did not come back on November 8. He
merely wrote a letter.
Mr. CHAYER. Wrote a letter. He never came back.
Representative Fund. Are all of the employees, Mr. Hoyder, Mr. McVekar,
and the others who had any firsthand contact with the Orwald case in this
area, were they State Department employees?...
Mr. CHATEA. Yes, sir; these two men, who were the only ones who did see
bim directly, I think the secretary, their secretary also saw him, but had nothing
to do with him except as a receptionist. There two men were Foreign Serv-
ice officers and are now Foreign Bervice officers.
Representative Foun. In the strictest term.
Mr. CRATES. Yes, pir; members of the Foreign Service, appointed by the
President with the advice and consent of the Senate.
Representative Ford, Could you tell us in a bit more detall the process that
you followed or the procedure that you carried out when you first got into the
Oswald case.
You mentioned yesterday you got a call or you were directed by I believe
the Secretary of State or by somebody in bigher authority to take certain steps.
Will you tell us who called you, what you did in the first 3 or 4 days?
Mr. CHATTS. It was the evening of the day, perhaps about 5 o'clock on the
day of the assassination. It may have been somewhat earlier, because I think
I remember I went home for an hour and then came back to carry out this
assignment. Mr. Ball, once it became known that Oswald had some history as
a defectur GEORGE WWW Ball
Mr. DULLES. Ball is the Under Secretary of State
D.C
Mr. CHAYES. He was then the Acting Secretary, because the Secretary of State
as you recall was on a plane over the Pacific, So he was the Acting Secretary.
But even if he had been the Under Becretary he is my client.
Representative Foan. He still had some authority.
Mr. CHATES. Yes; he directed me to gather together the files in the Department
on Oswald, and to prepare a report to be avaliable for him the first thing in the
morning covering as best we could within that time span the contacts that
Oswald had with the Department.
We got the passport file. We got the security office file. We got the special
consular services file which covered Mrs. Oswald's visa and the repatriation
Ioan. I think those three files were the ones that we bad. It may have been
there was a smaller fourth file, but I think those three were the ones.
Representative FORD, What would that smaller fourth file be?
Mr. CHATES. I can't remember. It was duplicates if it was anything. Oh, that
is right, we bad a visa file and an ECS file so those were the four. The 808
file, that is Special Consular Services, in the office, in the Bureau of Security
and Consular Affairs.
Representative FORD. You got this order on or about 5 o'clock the 22d of
November?
Mr. CHAYES, The 220
