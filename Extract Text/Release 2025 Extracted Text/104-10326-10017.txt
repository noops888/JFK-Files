THE RELEASE OF INFORMATION WHICH OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZES THE
FACT OF STATE COVER WILL BE A DELICATE ISSUE ACROSS THE DO AND
*--ALTHOUGH DAMAGE ASSESSMENTS IN THE<JFK ASSASSINATION>RECORDS REVIEW
BOARD (ARRB) ARE LIMITED TO ONLY FOUR COUNTRIES THE WORLD-WIDE USE
OF STATE COVER MEANS THE IMPLICATIONS WILL BE WIDELY FELT.
SENSE IT IS ALMOST SELF-DEFEATING TO ARGUE FROM FOUR SPECIFIC CASES
IN THIS
(MOSCOW, PARIS, MEXICO CITY, AND BUENOS AIRES) AND EXTRAPOLATE FOR
THE WHOLE DDO. NEVERTHELESS, WE WILL ATTEMPT TO RESPOND TO REF FROM
THE BA PERSPECTIVE...
3. OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION OF CIA USE OF STATE COVER IN ARGENTINA
WILL PREJUDICE UNILATERAL OFFICERS' COVER AND ACTIVITY, WHICH AS IN
MOST STATIONS IS THE COVER AND ACTIVITY WHICH MATTERS THE MOST IN
THAT THESE OFFICERS TEND TO HANDLE THE MOST SENSITIVE PENETRATIONS OF
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. OUR UNILATERAL OFFICERS ALSO HANDLE STATION'S
Â¡NON-OFFICIAL COVER (NOC) OFFICERS. THUS BY DEFINITION THE UNILATERAL
ACTIVITY CARRIED OUT BY THESE OFFICERS IS NON-COMPATIBLE, AND WOULD
CAUSE DAMAGE TO STATION'S RELATIONS WITH OUR VARIOUS LIAISON
SERVICES. CURRENTLY, STATION IS ENJOYING A PERIOD WHEREIN --AS A
RESULT OF PRESIDENT CLINTON'S VISIT HERE IN LATE 1997, AND THE CHIEF
OF THE PRINCIPAL LIAISON SERVICE'S VISIT TO HEADQUARTERS IN NOV 97--
LIAISON HAS DECIDED TO RE-ORIENT ITS ACTIVITIES AWAY FROM SMALL
LIAISON RELATIONSHIPS IT HAS WITH VARIOUS EUROPEAN SERVICES AND MORE
TOWARDS CIA. THIS STRATEGIC SHIFT, WHICH COULD HAVE LONG-TERM
BENEFITS_FOR CIA, WILL_BE_DASHED-WHEN-LIA-I-SON_SEES THAT WE RUN
NON-COMPATIBLE OPERATIONS IN BUENOS AIRES. THE TRUST THAT TAKES AN

MOREOVER, BILATERAL U.S.-ARGENTINE RELATIONS HAVE NEVER BEEN
CLOSER; THESE WOULD BE TARNISHED, NOT IRREPARABLY BY ANY MEANS, BUT
UNNECESSARILY, BY OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION OF CIA USE OF STATE COVER.
HISTORICALLY RELATIONS WITH ARGENTINA HAVE BEEN STRAINED, AND IT IS
ONLY DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS THAT A NEW PRESIDENT AND HIS BOLD
FREE-MARKET REFORMS HAVE PUSHED ARGENTINA SQUARELY INTO THE
1
DEMOCRATIC ORBIT. CURIOUSLY, THE CLOSE POLITICAL RELATIONS AND OUR
STEADILY-IMPROVING RELATIONS WITH LIAISON MEANS THAT BOTH PARTIES
-EMBASSY DIPLOMATS AND SENIOR LIAISON OFFICERS WONDER WHY WE NEED
TO SPY HERE IF WE CAN GET VIRTUALLY ANYTHING WE ASK FOR FROM LIAISON
OR FROM ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.
OPEN, COMFORTABLE ENVIRONMENT, AN INDICATION THAT STATION WAS WORKING
INDEED, IN THIS RELATIVELY
ON INCOMPATIBLE LOCAL TARGETS WOULD BE ESPECIALLY DAMAGING.

5.
AT THE RISK OF BORING THE READER WITH DETAIL, EMBASSY BUENOS
THIS
AIRES IS SO OPEN A WORKPLACE THAT THERE IS NO REAL CLEARED ACCESS
AREA (CAA), BUT RATHER A "HYBRID" CAA, TO USE THE RSO'S PHRASE.
MEANS THAT FSN'S HAVE LONG HAD OFFICES ON THE THIRD FLOOR, WHERE THE
*EXECUTIVE>OFFICES AND REPORTING OFFICES (INCLUDING STATION) ARE
LOCATED. NEEDLESS TO SAY, STATION IS NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE LOCAL
CONFIGURATION OF OFFICES, SINCE IT TENDS TO IDENTIFY OUR UNILATERAL
OFFICERS. IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, WHERE EMBASSY OFFICERS DO NOT HAVE A
FULL APPRECIATION OF THE ROLE/NEED FOR INTELLIGENCE IN SUCH AN OPEN,
FRIENDLY SOCIETY, OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION OF CIA'S USE OF STATE COVER
WOULD ONLY REAFFIRM THEIR POINT OF VIEW. OUR FEW UNILATERAL OFFICERS
WOULD ESSENTIALLY THEN BE DECLARED. STATION WOULD HAVE TO ATTEMPT TO
CHANGE OUR COVER PROFILE BY OBTAINING MORE NOC OFFICERS WHILE
REDUCING THE NUMBER OF UNILATERAL C/O'S. AS HEADQUARTERS IS AWARE,
UNDER CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES THERE ARE FEW NOCS, AND THE SELECTION AND
TRAINING OF NEW ONES TAKES YEARS AND IS EXPENSIVE. IN THIS SCENARIO,
BUENOS AIRES WOULD NEVER RECEIVE ENOUGH PRIORITY TO WARRANT SENDING
THREE NOC OFFICERS TO REPLACE THE THREE UNILATERAL SLOTS WE CURRENTLY
HAVE. THE END RESULT WOULD BE THAT WE WOULD COLLECT VERY LITTLE
INTELLIGENCE ON MAJOR PORTIONS OF OUR OPERATING DIRECTIVE (OD).
SPECIFICALLY, INTERNAL POLITICAL REPORTING, WHICH IS A FIRST PRIORITY
OBJECTIVE, WOULD BE ZEROED OUT, AND REPORTING ON THE WP AND ES
TARGETS, BOTH SECOND PRIORITY OBJECTIVES, WOULD BE NON-EXISTENT.
THIS WOULD BE A SERIOUS LOSS TO THE USG, SINCE OUR WP REPORTING HAS
HISTORICALLY BEEN THE ONLY MEANS OF LEARNING TO WHAT EXTENT THE
ARGENTINES ARE RESPECTING INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND NOT REBUILDING
THEIR MISSILE PROGRAM. ON THE ES TARGET, WE WOULD LOSE SIGNIFICANT
REPORTING ON REGIONAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND THE IMPACT OF THE ASIAN
FINANCIAL CRISIS IN THE AMERICAS. PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY, HOWEVER,
WE WOULD LOSE THE TRUST OF KEY HOST GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND OF SOME
SENIOR LIAISON OFFICIALS, WITH THE PREDICTABLE RESULT THAT IT WOULD
TAKE YEARS TO REBUILD THE RELATIONSHIP.
6. IN TERMS OF A SECURITY THREAT, BUENOS AIRES REMAINS THE ONLY
CAPITAL IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE THAT HAS BEEN THE VICTIM OF TWO
HIZBALLAH BOMBINGS, KILLING HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. A TERRORIST
INFRASTRUCTURE EXISTS-IN-THE TRI-BORDER AREA OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL,
AND PARAGUAY, WITH TIES INTO BUENOS_AIRES AS WAS-PROVEN-TWICE. TWO

ON LOCAL JEWISH OR U.S. INTERESTS, INCLUDING THIS EMBASSY.
ENVIRONMENT, PUBLICATION OF CIA USE OF OFFICIAL COVER MIGHT ENDANGER
PEOPLES' LIVES, SPECIFICALLY STATION OFFICERS'
ISLAMIYAH, AND HIZBALLAH ARE ALL ACTIVE LOCALLY.
ARGENTINA HAS AN ARAB POPULATION OF OVER 700,000.
IN THIS
HAMAS, GAMA'AT AL
IN ADDITION,
IN THE DIPLOMATIC
WORLD, THE CUBAN EMBASSY IS LARGE AND ACTIVE; WE ARE CERTAIN THEY
WOULD SEEK TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANY U.S. COVER GAPS. STATION HAS NOT
HAD ANY-STGNIFICANT COVER GAPS IN THE PAST, AND THUS ANY ONE OF THIS
MAGNITUDE WOULD HAVE A LARGE IMPACT.
