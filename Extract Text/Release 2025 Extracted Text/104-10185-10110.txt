Headquarters Comments
1. Although source saw Julian NOVAS Fernandez at the Cuban
Embassy in Mexico City in March 1964, the records of this
Agency reveal that source was probably in error in
assuming that NOVAS was assigned to that Embassy and
it is more likely that he was just passing through.
The following traces by this Agency is the basis for
this conclusion.
2. An official Jamaican source, in a report dated 24 March 1964,
stated that Julian NOVAS Fernandez arrived in Kingston,
Jamaica, on 18 March 1964, to take up his duties at the

His wife did not accompany him and source speculated that her
arrival may be delayed in view of NOVAS' present inclination for
feminine diversion.
In a report dated March 1964, this same source said that
Julian KOVAS Fernandez, the Cuban Commercial Attache at the
Cuban Consulate in Kingston, Jamaica, was born on 2 September 1938
in Habana, Cuba. He carried diplomatic passport D/64/80 which
was issued in Habana on 20 February 1964. His home address was
given as Carman No. 18, Vibora. He arrived in Kingston from
Mexico on 18 March 1964, on Mexicana Flight Number 305.
4. This same source, in a report dated 28 April 1964, stated that
the wife of Julian NOVAS Fernandez, the recently arrived Cuban
Commercial Attache, arrived in Kingston on 22 April 1964,
via Mexico. Her name is Amarilis Karta VALDES Hijuel√≥s and
she was born on 19 May 1937, in Jiquani, Oriente, Cuba. VALDES
has been indisposed since her arrival in Kingston; this is
probably due to her advanced pregnancy. Her home address in
Cuba is Avenida 31, Number 3622, Eabana. She carried diplomatic
passport D/01/239, issued in Habana on 9 April 1964.
5. This same source, in a report dated 9 May 1964, noted that
