1. The SW supplies and instructions needed to establish two-way SW
correspondence with AMIRE 1 are transmitted herewith. We realize that some of
the instruction forms and supplies which are being transmitted are duplicates
of those sent to the Station in support of other operations. However, in order
to facilitate the handling of each operation, the supplies for each are
furnished as a complete unit. This will preclude the need for borrowing from
one agent's supplies to outfit another.
2. AMIRE) will write to the Case Officer, using carbon system #39337.
Two unused sheets of carbon #39337 should be issued to the agent for this
purpose. He should be told to store them separately to avoid accidental loss
of his writing system. His carbon system is developed by means of tablet
#30607. A supply of the developer material, in quantities sufficient for
training purposes, accompanies this dispatch.
3. According to the AMIRE operational plan, SW messages written by AMIRE
will be mailed to accommodation addresses in various Latin American countries.
In accordance with that, KURIOT will provide the appropriate (AMIRE Field Stations)
with the materials necessary for developing the operational messages.
4. AMIRE 1 will develop the SW messages he receives by means of pill #58838.
He should be issued (twenty pills #58838 for that purpose. It is
recommended that the agent be told to hide his developer materials in a safe
place. This should not present much of a problem because (the pills are so
small. We do not generally recommend that (pills be camouflaged as medicines.
Even in cases where the SW ingredient(does have a bona fide medicinal usage,
the concentration represented by the SW pill would usually be in excess of the
normal dosage, and thus there would be a danger of having an unwitting person
use them by accident. If the Case Officer feels that for operational reasons
it is desirable (to camouflage them as medicines) they should only be kept in a
bottle which is clearly marked FOR REAL USE ONLY.
5. According to the operational plan, the SW messages to agent AMIRE will
be prepared for the Area Division by KURIOT at Headquarters. The Area Division
will pouch the SW messages as "blank" sheets of stationery) to the appropriate
Field Station for application of the cover test and mailing.
6. The AMIRE Case Officer should familiarize himself with the
accompanying supplies and instructions before any attempt is made to train and
issue supplies to the agent. Experience has shown that it is advisable to plan
for two or three short (2 hour) agent training sessions scheduled over a period
of days, rather than to attempt to cram the training into one long session.
7. Special attention should be given to planning the cover correspondence.
It is usually recommended that the agent use false name and return address on
his SW messages to the Section, thereby dis-associating himself completely
from his SW reports once they are in the mail channel. This requires that the
correspondence be fictional, and entails a certain amount of skill on the part
of AMIRE in fabricating apparently innocent correspondence. We have found
that the use of a false postal identity frequently provides the agent with
considerable psychological reassurance during the course of the operation.
3. The cover correspondence must in no way appear to be different from
the bulk of mail ordinarily found in the channel being used. It should contain
no information which could be viewed as suspicious in any way. The external
aspects of the correspondence must be innocent in all aspects if the SW is to
be expected to provide any level of security.
9. We have found that the safety of any system depends nearly
entirely on the care with which it is used. Please stress the need for care-
ful writing techniques in your agent training sessions.
10. The following supplies and instructions are transmitted in support of
the AMIRE operation:
a. Standard Form (#1059-CWT) which describes in detail how to
write (with a carbon sheet).
b. One carbon sheet #12010) labeled (DEMONSTRATION CARBON) to be
used to demonstrate the principles of carbon writing. The development
process for this system can be carried out in the agent's presence.
c. One (bottle (100 ml.) of developer (#30609) which will develop
the DEMONSTRATION CARBON writing.
d. Instruction (Form #H-16029) describing the development of the
(DEMONSTRATION CARBON).
e. Three carbon sheets #39337) The one labeled (PRACTICE CARBON)
is to be used in training and is to be retained by the Station. (Two)
are to be issued to the agent. The agent should not be allowed to
witness the development of this system, nor should he be shown the
message after development.
f. Instruction Form (#36037) specific instructions for the
development (of carbon system #39337).
g. Twenty pills #30607, to be used to develop practice and real
messages written with carbon #39337).
h. Two practice messages written with AMIRE's ingoing SW system
which he should use to practice his development technique.
i. Twenty-five pills (#58838) which AMIRE will use to develop the
SW messages he receives. Two or three of these pills) should be used
in training. Twenty of the remaining pills) should be issued to the
agent.
j. Instruction Form (#R-25053) instructions for the use of
(developer #58838).
k. One copy of the "Station Maintenance of SW Supplies" Form.
l. Miscellaneous items such as (cotton, swab sticks and blotters;
items generally useful for SW processing.
11. You will note that two different kinds of (carbon sheets) have been
submitted with the supplies. One is labeled (DEMONSTRATION CARBON). This should
be used in the practice session only. It should be used to demonstrate (carbon)
writing techniques to the agent. This system can be developed in the agent's
presence. The agent's operational carbon (#39337) is labeled (PRACTICE CARBON).
After the agent has mastered the use of the DEMONSTRATION (One sheet of carbon #39337 has been labeled (PRACTICE CARBON). The agent should be
given an opportunity to write with the (PRACTICE CARBON). It is very important
that the Case Officer have the chance to critique the agent's SW writing
technique with the actual system which the agent will use. However, the agent
should not/
12. The Station should retain the (DEMONSTRATION CARBON), and the rest of the supplies. Please bear in mind that
messages and working materials should be treated as classified.
13. Please do not hesitate to request additional help from us as
needed.
