stated that Major Jose Ramon FERNANDEZ was the Chief of the
Seccion Preparacion y Organizacion Combativa (Section for
the Preparation and Organization of Warfare - SPOC), the
Cuban Army's key man for defense against invasion, and the
military brains of the country. He had access to all secret
information. FERNANDEZ received his instructions exclusively
from Fidel and Raul CASTRO with whom he is in personal contact.p

intelligent and reportedly not a Communist.

7: & fairly reliable source, in a report dated 7 August 1963,
stated that she did not think FERNANDEZ was a Communist as he
bas always had Catholic tendencies but that he is a correct
soldier and puts the military above everything. He is divorced
and his ex-wife is living in Miami with their two daughters,
Francis, born in 1951, and Alice, born in 1955.
8. A source who is a high ranking Cuban military officer who has
good contacts among Cuban officials (he has not submitted many
reports, but they appear to have been accurate) reported in
September 1963 that Major Jose Ramon FERNANDEZ Alvarez, Chief
of Training, General Staff of the Cuban Rebel Aray, is anti-
Communist and a military type in the strictest sense of the
word. He sticks to his military duties and scrupulosely
avoids politics; he keeps himself completely isolated from
all political elements. He is proud of his present status
and thankful to CASTRO for it; for fear of losing it he
appears unwilling to undertake any kind of activity against
the CASTRO regime. CASTRO is undoubtedly knowledgeable of
FERNANDEZ' attitude and has sufficient confidence in him to
retain him in his present position. CASTRO also is aware
that he has few officers with the military discipline,
know-how, and experience possessed by FERNANDEZ.
