!
In Sep 60 I talked to an old friend who was president of one of the US-owned
tire companies recently interevened by the Castro regima. My friend
stated that he had recently contacted Segundo Cevallos, one of the
top officials of the Rational Bank, in comection with obtaining approval
for some of the company's US technicians to take their furniture and
appliances out of Cuba. Cevallos said, "I don't want those technicians
to leave. We need then." At this, the rubber company official stated
that it was too late and that the technicians had already gone.
Cevallos then wade the statement that he was very much concerned about
the flight of technicians of all kinds from Cuba. He said that the
revolution had been fought to give Cuba & more highly developed industry,
but that the technicians were leaving and industry was being seriously
effected.
Cevallos then said, "Something is wrong. The revolution has gotten off
the track somewhere." He then added, "I have got to talk to 'Che' about
this."
Cevallos is a man of about 60-63 years, and has a very important position,
in that he is in charge of granting foreign exchange. Hy friend said
that Cevallos is a very pleasant individual but seems to be a theorist,
a professorial type who obviously has had little or no business experience.
He has a background as a writer and philosopher, and apparently is
extremely naive as evidenced by his comment that he would talk to "Che"
Guevara about how the revolution had gotten off the track.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION
US national, graduate engineer, an official on the staff of a large
oil company.
Source has had years of experience in company operations outside the
US and has been located in Cuba for many years. (Source is normally
available for reinterrogation should this report generate additional
requirements.)
As of Sep 60 there appear to be some significant developments occurring
axong personnel of the staff of the Caban Petroleum Institute. The
Institute has cosasndeered a building of Reso Standard Oil SA for
use as headquarters, and is currently engaged in mixing the personnel
of all three intervened oil companies in the new headquarters.
The shuffling around of personnel has further losered the morale of
the petroleva industry employees, and I have been told that 95% are
strongly in favor of the companies and against the Castro regime.
Since ICP established its new offices, indoctrination sessions of employees
have been scheduled on a twice-a-week basis. The first session was
bald recently and was concerned with the "Colored Problem of the World".
The gist of the remarks of the conference leader was that Cubans were
of Spanish ethnic origin, and because of the close ties of Spaniards
and the Hoors for so many hundreds of years it had to be realized that
all Cubana had colored blood, and should not make a distinction and
should have no prejudices concerning people with colored blood.
The second indoctrination session was headed by an overt Communist fron
the Texas Company. He delivered the straight Party Line, anti-US,
anti-imperialist, anti-sonopoly, "The Soviet Union is the great hope
of the world for peace", and only Communist ideology will survive, etc.
He also stated that, "The Declaration of Havana of Fidel Castro will
be our doctrine," and said that it was desired to obtain the signatures
of the whole population of Cuba to show that everyone was behind this
doctrine. He then said in response to a question regarding what would
happen to those who did not sign, "You are either for us or against us."
6. At this, one of the office girls who had been a strong Fidelista got up
and remarked that such comments reminded her of the Batista days, and she
strongly disapproved of any pressure tactics.

One of the male office employees then stood and stated that he agreed
heartily with her, and added that it was not the intent of the revolu-
tion to "get into this sort of business." He then asked, "Why are we
getting all this Communist propaganda and why do we not hear anything about
Jose Marti?" His comments were greeted with applause.
8.
A third zaployee stood up and calked for 45 minutes. He really laid it
on the line concerning the way the revolution had failed the people of
Cuba, and had leaned far too much toward Communism. The conference
leader did not interrupt and following the conclusion of the employee's
remarks did not even ansver. He merely said, "That is all", got up
and walked out. However, the next scheduled indoctrination session
was cancelled.
9.
Although mixing the employees of the three companies was doce deliberately
to break up a feeling of trust among employees who knew each other, and
to introduce a feeling of fear concerning strangers, there has been close
cooperation on the technical level between employees of at lesat two
refineries. For example, technicians at Esso and Shell recently collaborated
in shutting down the refineries without real justification, allegedly
because of Hurricane Donna. When the word got out that the refineries
were shutting down, ICP officials rushed in and protested vigorously that
there was no danger, and that the action should
not be taken. The
technicians then said, "Well, it is too late now," and they kept the
refineries shut down for three full days. Both Shell and Esso technicians
concerned enjoyed this minor act of sabotage hugely.
10.
They also cooperated in dealying action when they were ordered to start
the cat plant. LPG is needed badly, so the technicians decided to keep
the unit shut down. ICP officials screamed that it was unnecessary
and ordered them to start, but the technicians said that it was not
practical because it was too difficult, and possibly dangerous, to stop
and start the unit. They said that the shortage of catalysts made it
impossible to figure on keeping the unit going, and so it was not the
right thing to do to start it at all. Consequently they have been able
to keep the cat units shut down completely since the storm.

11.
One of the top Shell engineers who has participated in such actions
is going to attempt to skip the country as a test, because many other
technicians of the oil companies are desperate to flee Cuba and are
trying to arrange ways and means to do so.

i
A real body-blow could be given the Castro regime if a few selected
technicians in the oil refineries skipped the country. As an example,
at the Esso refinery there are four technicians whose loss would have
a very severe effect on the production of the refinery. These sen are
all young, extremely intelligent, well trained, and are completely
loyal to the company. They have served immediately below the super-
Intendent and the assistant superintendent. These four would be given
immediate jobs in the US, because of their outstanding backgrounde, if
they were able to get out of Cuba.
The top figure of the four is Leon Hequin Maya, who is a specialist in
the Processing Department, one of the most important functions in the
plant. This departmant's responsibilities deal with the physical processing
of the product from crude to the finished material.
Hequin is 32 years old, married, no children, but expecting a child in
Dec 60. He is a graduate of Auburn University, with a degree in chemical
er mechanical engineering. He is a Cuban national, I believe of the
Jewish faith. He is about 5'10", weighs about 160 lbs, has close cropped
black hair, and is a very personable, intelligent young man. He is a
very good leader, and was definitely one of the men on their way up
in the company..
Hequin already has been branded a counterrevolutionary in an official Acta,
and has been taken out of the plant and put into the office. Apparently
the regime wanted to get him away from the production line for fear of
possible sabotage, and also wanted to utilize his undoubted talent and
knowledge of the industry in headquarters.
5. Hequin is extremely eager to get out of Cuba, but he does not have a
police exit permit, and since he has been branded counterrevolutionary
he is afraid he would not get his passport back if he presented it for
a police permit.

Another outstanding young man is Eequin's assistant, Jose Ramon Alvarez,
about 31. He is a graduate of Auburu University and is a top flight
engineer. Since Alvarez is single, he says that he will wait until
the others get out of Cuba. He also wants to hang back to be able
to do some sabotage before he makes his departure. He believes that
he will be able to get out on his own.
A third top flight mechanical engineer, who is extremely eager to leave
Cuba, is Santiago Pardo Suarez del Villar. He is about 35, a graduate
of the University of Havana. Pardo is head of Maintenance and Construction,
and is an extremely intelligent and capable engineer. He is about
5'8", weighs about 170 lbs, and has dark black shair and a moustache.
The fourth is Raul Capote Ortiz, a graduate of Louisiana State University
with the degree in chemical engineering. Capote is one of the top
technicians in the Processing Department. He is married, but I do
not know if he has any children.

US national, graduate engineer, an official on the staff of a large oil
company.
Source has had years of experience in company operations outside the US
and has been located in Cuba for many years. (Source is normally avail-
able for reinterrogation should this report generate additional requirements.)
As of Aug 60 the three major refineries confiscated by the Castro regina
are operating in fairly good shape. Their principal problem is that
the Soviet crude being supplied is very light and they cannot run as
mich volums because gas pressure builds up. The Esso refinery, for
example, has a capacity of 36 thousand bbls per day on heavy crude, but
26 thousand bbis per day is the best they have besa abie to do on the
Soviet crude, and it has been running at a rate of only 20 thousand bbls.
per doy since 20 Jul 60.
The Soviet crude available to date has been compatible with the refineries
and will not damage them, but in addition to not being able to get as
much volume, the rafineries cannot get as much fuel oil because of light
ends. This is true of all three for refineries.
The refinerets were designed for 26 gravity crude which is fairly heavy.
The Soviet crude is 33 gravity, and has caused an imbalance in that
they are now producing more gasoline than is needed. As a consequence,
Cuba is searching desperately for fuel oil. The USSR has said that it
is not in a position to supply fuel oil and so Cuba has turned toward
Mexico, even to the extent of attempting to arrange deals whereby they
will trade gasoline for fuel oil.
The imbalance of gasoline is indicated by the fact that the Cabaiguan
refinary was shut dowa recently because its gasoline storage was completely
filled.
Cuba will reach a critical point about 1 Sep 60. The Esso refinery slowed
down from 26 thousand bble per day to 20 thousand bbls per day because
it had only a 10-day supply of crede. The supply on hand was sufficient
to last only until 14 Ang, but around 11 Aug the refinery was supposed
to receive a shipment of 80 thousand barrels of crude. However, this
is only enough to operate four days.

oil company.
Source has had years of experience in company operations outside the US
and has been located in Cuba for many years. (Source is normally
available for reinterrogation should this report generate additional
requirements.]
As of Aug 60 there is a shortage of lubricating oil in Cuba which will
becoms critical in a fairly short time. Great efforts have been made
by the Castro regime to obtain lubricating oil from US suppliers, and
a vessel, the Mar Carite, has visited a number of US ports attempting
to obtain the oil. However, it has been refused everywhere and had to
raturn to Cubs in ballast. As of 10 Aug 60 it is loading molasses
for delivery to Boston, and will then proceed to Montreal in an attempt
to obtain lubricating oil.

A former Esso employee, Frank García, left Cuba on 2 Aug 60 for Mexico
to try to obtain lubricating oil. He is going to visit the Mobile
blending plant, PEMEX, and several others.
Poft. Wallace
Tuba, Okla..
A US national recently employed by ICP to attempt to arrange for the
purchase of necessary supplies and spare parts for the oil industry
has been traveling throughout the SW part of the US, also attempting to
arrange for lubricating oil, but with no success. This individual io
such an unsavory character that it is not beyond the bounds of probablity
that he might "go south" with the funds entrusted to him, which are
considerable.
There are 20 principal types of lubritating oil needed for the total
economy, and the actual status of supply of each is not known. They
may be completely out of some and have six months supply of others.
However, the general story is that there is a "one month supply" of
lubricating oil available.
5. Lubricants for power plants, transportation, and commmications are the
primary concern. They are in critically short supply in diesel lubricants
for engines and heavy equipment, and turbine oil for power plants.
6.
There is no lubricating oil manufactured on the island although the
Castro regime is trying to set up a plant. However, this is a long
range project and takes a lot of time and money..
