Have you been interviewed by members of thel

Mr. Goodwin.
I have been shown documents connected with

material, would you recount for the Committee your understandin
of what the United States government policy toward the Dominic
Republic was in the winter and spring of '61 and what actions
were taken to implement that policy.
5
6
Mr. Goodwin. Well, that policy was a continuation of the
policy established by President Eisenhower when he, in
accordance with the vote of the OAS, voted to sever -- decided

to sever diplomatic and commercial relations with the Dominican,
Republic and the situation which you know arose was precipitated
by the attempted assassination of President Detancourt by the
President of the Dominican Republic.
So that from that point on when we came in, the feeling
was, first of all, of course that Trujillo was even more
at odds with the philosophy of the Alliance for Progress than
had bean and beyond that, having cut off diplomatic and other
relations, that Trujillo's time: in office was probably.
numbered. The principal support of the regime in that decade
which was often in great domestic difficulty had been tha
concept of American support, it strengthened Trujillo against
his opposition.
!
21
At that point our policy became one of trying to anticio:
at least, the fall of Trujillo. Of course the Castro thing
22
was very much in everybody's mind and the principal concern
23
the President, the one thing he didn't want was for Trujillo
24
to go and a Communist leader to come in. So I think the policy

was to keep up our economic and diplomatic pressure to hope

peacefully or died a natural death that the succession would

the potential successor groups, and it was very hard to
pinpoint.
Mr. Schwarz. What steps did you take during the period
of time you were involved, or prior thereto, if you know
about it, in order to assist one or more of the dissident
groups?
Mr. Goodwin. Well, we did all sorts everything from
policy statements, the use of USIA, the use of economic
pressure, to maintain our network of contacts with exile
groups principally'in New York and elsewhere. A certain number
of limited covert operations, some transfer of arms. Dearborn
of course was one of the principals, his principal instruction
was to try to keep all channels of communication open, he was
zealous in this because he disliked Trujillo intensely himself
and felt that he ought to be allied with these other groups.
And I read through the sort of overall planning papers, and I
think they fairly reflect that range of operations.
None of them were terribly effective.
Mr. Schwarz. In connection with the transfer of arma,

Mr. Schwarz. And that was at a meeting of the Special

Group?

Mr. Goodwin. Well, I don't know because they didn't let
7

transfer of a couple of carbines and .38 pistols. After the
transfer had been made, I the message of communication that
came to us from the Dominican Republic along with the request
for the transfer of machine guns which were to be used in an
effort to kill Trujillo, the smaller guns were to be given as
Dearborn told me later in conversation after the assassination
because these people felt their own lives were in danger,
especially if they embarked on anything as risky as trying to
kill Trujillo, and they wanted some self-defense weapons, and
they were given to them for self-defense and then they made a
request that they wanted weapons to try an assassination, they
wanted a machine gun.

Mr. Schwarz. Did you make that statement, Mr. Goodwin?
Mr. Goodwin. I don't remember making it. It is an

Actually the delivery took place after January 20th 1961.
Mr. Goodwin. Well that was my first impression on reading
that, but I notice that all it says was late January, Senator,
so I suppose the 20th or the 19th in somebody's mind could be
late January. I mean, I don't really remember.

which simply informed me that the delivery of carbines had been

made in late January. I don't know any more than that.

Mr. Schwarz. In addition with dealing with Dearborn, were

you dealing with anybody from the CIA on this?

At the meeting with the Vice President, I'm sure some-
body like Bissell, at least, would have been there. But I'm
sure you must have a list.

Mr. Schwarz. Now I would like you to testify in answer to
19
a series of questions as to what you were or were not told.
20
Now, were you told that the arms which had been delivered
2
had been delivered to persons who said at times that they
wanted to use them for personal defense, but who said more
22
23
often that they wanted to use them for assassination purposes?

specifically and it's reflected in the documents, that they

which we marked as Exhibit 1, that the dissidents intended to
