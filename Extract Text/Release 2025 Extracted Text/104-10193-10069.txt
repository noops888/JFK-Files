Memo for File - William P. Burke
Subject: Longevity Step Increase
In reviewing this file under the Security
reinvestigation program, it was noted that the
3rd LSI ( GS-15) was proposed to be made effective
on 18 Sept 60, but that the effective date had been
changed by Payroll to show 16 Oct 60. Reason for
the change is presumed to be due to LWOP. Form 560
shows 225 hours of DOP during the waiting period.
If those figures are correct, then there was no
"excess" LWOP, since the law provides that a maxi-
mam of 240 hours of IHOP is creditable toward com
pletion of the waiting period in the case of LSI's.
:
I called this case to the attention of Joe
Tracy, C/Payroll, who will review WOP records and,
if required, issue a memorandum to correct the
effective date of the last ISI.

finds it difficult without most careful and protracted

certain areas it is a definite asset in New Orleans. When
