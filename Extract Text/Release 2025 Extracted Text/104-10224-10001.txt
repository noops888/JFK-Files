Dear Mr. Naksymiec:
20016
This letter is in response to the comment you made
to the Director on Alumni Day, 26 April 1975, concerning
a special medallion for NPIC employees who participated
in the Cuban missile crisis,
I have had the appropriate records reviewed. The
Cortificate of Commendation you and other NPIC employees
received was awarded by direction of the President in
recognition of the meritorious service performed.
It is hoped that the lack of a medallion to accompany
this certificate will in no way detract from the contribu-
tion you made during this period of crisis.
Sincerely,
/c/John E. Blake

1. The facts behind the question raised with the
Director by Mr. Maksymec on Saturday, 26 April, are,
according to him, as follows.
2. After NPIC had done its fine work during the
Cuban missile crisis it appears that two different types
of recognition were given. Determinations were made
first on certain individuals whose contributions were
such that they should receive an Agency medal award. A
second group of some 200 were then identified for their
level of contribution and received some kind of certifi-
cate from the White House signed by the President. Μг.
Maksymec was in the latter group and espouses the cause
that a "special medallion" should have been given along
with the White House certificate. Mr. Rob Gaynor also
spoke to me on this matter on Saturday, and has a good
recollection on the whole
