1. A source of this office has just advised us s that he received
a Christmas card (1962) from Maurice Halperin on which the return address
was given as: "Apt C-2,3 2, Calle 12, 2, no 103, Miramar, Habana, Cuba." The
only message on the card was one of Christmas greetings. Helperin and
our source have known each other for a number of years and they always
exchange Christmas cards This is the first one Halperin has sent with
a Cuban address on it. The last time that our source saw Halperin vas
in Moscow when he (the former) vas visiting in the USSR during August-
September 1961 as part of an official US delegation...
2. In view of Halperin's past activities and associations, we are
making this information known to you. Our source comments that Helperin
always seems to show up wherever there is some sort of activity going
ag on
