20 August 1965
1. Edward W. LORENTZ met with Eduardo Whitehouse on 17 August
1965, relative to finalizing the Whitehouse claim for monies still
due from his previous contract. LORENTZ emphasized that he was
authorized to pay monies due per contract through 7 April 1965,
plus a four day layover in Rome during Whitehouse's return to the
"U.S. This layover was due a Panam strike of which Whitehouse was
4.inadvertently delayed through no fault of his own.
2. The aforegoing authority is based on ref and calculated
as follows:
A. Base Pay for March
B.
-
USD 800.
Base Pay 7/30 for April - USD 186.66
plus USD equivalent of USD 41.00 for actual expenses
while 2 days in Rome.
C. Total USD 1027.66.
3. Whitehouse although feeling that he should be allowed the
full amounts due amounting to USD 1950.00 has accepted such adjud-
ication of his claim. LORENTZ feels that possibly he was suffic-
iently satisfied that he received any funds, that probably in his
sense of fair play that the case might be considered closed.
the record, what medical treatment received by Whitehouse amounted
to under USD 200. Το further complete the record the following
attachments are enclosed:
A. Letter from Dr. Elkhoury.
B. Second letter from Whitehouse to Jack
Anderson, Leop.
C. Letter from Whitehouse to LORENTZ.

4.
Less than 24 hours after facing Whitehouse to advise him
that his claim of USD 1950 had been reduced to 1027.66, Whitehouse
reacted with the newspaper media in an exemplary manner when he
could have reacted with a adverse feeling. The Subject despite
difficulties encountered in the field with KUBARK advisors appears
to be man of honor and certainly under controlled situations ASA
professional pilot and could be an asset to KUBARK interests.

Mr. Jerry Sounders
1.C Box 231
Miami Int. Agor
Xiami, Fia.
Dear Mr. Sounders:
Three months have passed by since my return from
Leopoldville and as I explained to you in our rast
meetings, the amounts corresponding to the basic tay
of of March, Arcil and up to the 13th of May, when
my contract expired- are still unpaid therefore lea-
ving an outstanding balance of $1950.00 in my favor.
Although I appreciate your concern in this case,
I wish to informe about certain facts concerning
zy work in the Congo that will ex lain how every cent
of the mentioned ancunt was earned.
:
When pilot Fausto Gomez was shot doun near Sunia
-Dec. 17th 1964- that Air Base became paralized as
two of the pilcas resigned and the only one remaining
was ready to leave. Every one refused to take charge
of the Bunia Base beeruse of the proximity of the re-
bels, dangerous terrain, living conditions below stan-
dards, improper food, etc. Under these adverse circums-
tances I accepted the position of Chief Pilot and left
the confortable quarters of Stanleyville. Arrived to
Bunia Dec. 25th 1967 and next day reasumed full air
of erations against the rebels flying two and three mis-
sions per day as squadron leader with now unexperienced
pilots. These pilots did not have shooting, combat ma-
navering instruction, therefore I instructed then and
also in Dead Reckoning, instrument flying, etc. We hit
the enemy day by day Scrcing them to retreat to the ve-
ry border of Northeast Congo. M. Godofrcid. Munengo -1-
nister of the Interior- personally congratulated us for
our accomplishements in behalf of the Congo.
When I became 111, due to improper food, parasites,
etc.. I was ordered back to Lecpoldville for medical
treatment. Unable to recover and having lost 25 pounds,
Dr. Elki.cury suggested żę return to Mani for a more a-
dequate treatment. Fhotostatic copy of certificate are
attached. Loft Leopoldville April 3 1965 with the un-
derstanding that zy contract was not being cancelled.
I sincerely believe that my work and dedication thro-
ughout the entire campaing in Fortheast Congo deser-
ved the full payment of the mentioned contract.
Your consideration to this matter would be açırecia-
ted.

Less than 24 hours after facing Whitehouse to advise him
that his claim of USD 1950 had been reduced to 1027.66, Whitehouse
reacted with the newspaper media in an exemplary manner when he
could have reacted with a adverse feeling. The Subject despite
difficulties encountered in the field with KUBARK advisors appears
to be man of honor and certainly under controlled situations ASA
professional pilot and could be an asset to KUBARK interests.

Xiami, Fia.
Dear Mr. Sounders:
Three months have passed by since my return from
Leopoldville and as I explained to you in our rast
meetings, the amounts corresponding to the basic tay
of of March, Arcil and up to the 13th of May, when
my contract expired- are still unpaid therefore lea-
ving an outstanding balance of $1950.00 in my favor.
Although I appreciate your concern in this case,
I wish to informe about certain facts concerning
zy work in the Congo that will ex lain how every cent
of the mentioned ancunt was earned.
:
When pilot Fausto Gomez was shot doun near Sunia
-Dec. 17th 1964- that Air Base became paralized as
two of the pilcas resigned and the only one remaining
was ready to leave. Every one refused to take charge
of the Bunia Base beeruse of the proximity of the re-
bels, dangerous terrain, living conditions below stan-
dards, improper food, etc. Under these adverse circums-
tances I accepted the position of Chief Pilot and left
the confortable quarters of Stanleyville. Arrived to
Bunia Dec. 25th 1967 and next day reasumed full air
of erations against the rebels flying two and three mis-
sions per day as squadron leader with now unexperienced
pilots. These pilots did not have shooting, combat ma-
navering instruction, therefore I instructed then and
also in Dead Reckoning, instrument flying, etc. We hit
the enemy day by day Scrcing them to retreat to the ve-
ry border of Northeast Congo. M. Godofrcid. Munengo -1-
nister of the Interior- personally congratulated us for
our accomplishements in behalf of the Congo.
When I became 111, due to improper food, parasites,
etc.. I was ordered back to Lecpoldville for medical
treatment. Unable to recover and having lost 25 pounds,
Dr. Elki.cury suggested żę return to Mani for a more a-
dequate treatment. Fhotostatic copy of certificate are
attached. Loft Leopoldville April 3 1965 with the un-
derstanding that zy contract was not being cancelled.
I sincerely believe that my work and dedication thro-
ughout the entire campaing in Fortheast
