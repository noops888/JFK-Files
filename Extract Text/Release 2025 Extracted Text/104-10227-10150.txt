MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Meeting with Dr. MIRC Cardona on 6 October
1. Dr. MIRO arrived about 9:50 a. m. for the meeting we had
set at 10:00; again he was driven by his secretary whom he introduced.
As during the first ineeting, she remained outside in the car. Our
tweeting lasted until 12:00 noon.
2. First, Dr. MIRO handed me a note in longhand Hoting the
topics discussed with me an 5 October. These points are:
a. Croups conducting propaganda, etc. with Agency support
should receive their support and to coordinated through the Council.
b. A propaganda campaign should be waned by the Council
atuned at:
(1) Cuba, via a long wave radio station in Key West.
(2) Cubans in Miami and other. U. S. areas by:
(a) Subsidising Diario de las Americas.
(5) Contracting for time on radio stations.
(3) Latin America, with a plan such as the Operacion
Griete."
c. Underground Activities.
(1) Provision of monthly funde te Council for procuring
Cuban pesos to send to the seven-odd resistance
groups in Cuba through reliable charmels (such as
previously sent through the Italian Embassy).
114-00000
(2) Commando action as outlined in plan presented
to me on 6 clober.
J. Commando ilan
!
Then Dr. MIRC handed me a plan (in English) for clandestine
action prepared by his military collaborators, whom he named as
Colonel Manuel VARELA Castro, an officer of the Academy, Captain
Enrique DESPAIGNE, and Colonel (fan) MONTEAGUDO, He slated
that they were of the BARQUIN group and had been prisoners.
With respect to the plan for clandestine operations in Cuba,
he stated that 300 men could be counted uson for commando action, part
of them hore, part in Cubs. Ho reiterated that a commando operation
was essential to holster morale among the anti-Castro cloments In Cuba
atrd in exile sa well as to conduct sabotage that would further weaken
Cuban economy and the Communist regime. He said that for this operation
V. 5. help would be necessary in groviding weapons, arnino, demolitions,
equipmont, and funds. He proposed that if this plan was considered to
have merit, that I arrange to have someone mact with his military mon
to work out the details. After all preparations had been made and
matoriel provided, etc, the operation would be purely a Cuban affair.
(NOTE: Plan turned over to Thorageen at our ne eting at 13:30 on
6 October for transmission.)
4. Request for Arms, etc. to send to Becambray
Dr.MIRO renmarked that over a month ago he had made a request
to Clark for arma for the anti-Castro insurgents in the iscainbray, but
to dato had heard nothing relative to the request. He commented wryly.
"I aok but never hear an answer. He said that the lighterso there should
be supported. Dr. MIRC stated that he had a boat (provided by us) and
a means for delivery of the arme. Cavaldo RAMIREZ is chief of the
Escambray group.
COMMENT: Has anything been done about this request?
3. Information on Arms Heceived by Castro Regimo
Ur. MIRO handed ine a lone report which he said was brought
to him by the Argentine Ambassador to Cuba when the latter came to the
U. S. at the time of President PROTOILIO visit. "He paid the Ambassador
would not divulge the source of the information but commented, "You will
know."
* Report turned over to Thompson on 6 October.
2
Dr. MIRO said there was no way to determine the accuracy
of the figures given of planes, guns, etc, received from the Soviet bloe
(and haly and Canada) but even if the figures were exaggerated 100 per
ceat, they would still be impressive.
Ho added that Castro is daily becoming stronger militarily
with weapons and with a large militia of close to 300,000 being trained
to use them while the economy continues to deteriorate. Ferhaps only
half the militia would be effective. But that is siseable. Thus, he said,
the longer the delay in positive military action to overthrow Castro, the
greater will be the task. We must act soon, vigorously and effectively,
to insure victory. Another defeat would be disastrous and would make
Cubans, Latin Americans and others believo Castro to be invincibi,
Then would come accommodations and even worse, the traplanting of
Castro-backed regimes in the hormisphere. And the U. S. would sufier
worst of all, being diacredited for defeat and "gullt of interiorence."
"in the UN na nation would stand boside the U. S."
6. Proposal that Connell go to Cuba with Commando Group and
Establish a Coverament on Cuban soil
Dr. MIRO then declared that he was convinced that Castro
would never be overthrown by all the propagania, the sabotage, commando
raide, guerrilla activities, rupture of diplomatic relations and deteriorating
ocononly, and that it was inconceivable to establish a government-irexite
for nothing would come of it, that the only soluiton for defeating the
Castro regime was for the Revolutionary Conacil to go to Cuba and estab-
lish a goverament cu Cuban soll, ask recognition by all friendly countries
and military assistance of its pricipal ally, the U. S., and that the U.S.
be ready to intervene immediately with its Forces. This would all have
to take place in a matter of 48 hours, otherwise it would fail. I recognise
that this is a bold plan, but boldness is necessary. There will be many
risko, many may be killed. As for myself, I don't care if I die. I have
loat all my personal possessions and my son is a prisoner," he reiterated
that all roust be well prepared in advance, there must be no vaciliation,
everything must procood rapidly. First, a cocinando raid in force to
eeixa a place of Cuban territory, preferably near Guantanamo, and lonia-
diately the members of the Council go ashore, proclaim a provisional
government, broadcast by radio to all nations an appeal for recognition
(and cables prepared in advance would also be sent out), request U. S.
assistance, and the U. 5. should furaish euch assistance at once in ade-
quate strength to easure victory.
3
Belore such an action in undertaken, the enemy srast しゅ
softened by propaganda, sabotage, raido, underground action, and the
mass of the people of Cuba musi be prepared to accept the provisionai
government through propaganda, increased knowledge of the Council
and its unifying efforts.
Dr. MIRO asked the what I thought of into project; did i think
that Castro could be overthrown in any other way. I admitted that
strong military action appeared necessary. I stated further tiet
of course his plan would have to be studied at the highest government
levels. He proposed that he might elaborate a plan with his military
collaboratora, and I suggested that he do this so that it might be examined
and considered.
Dr. MIRO declared that he was convinced that thie Communist
degger in the side of the States could only be eradicated by such action,
that the U.S. Is and will be blamed for ail anti-Castro promazanda,
sabotage, etc. and that enemy states will denounce it for latervention
In Cube, but that if the V. 5. goes to the aid of a friendly revolutionary
regimo established in the country and helps it defeat the Soviet-backed
Communist regime, all friendly governments will applaud.
"I have no personal politicei ambitions, declared MIEC.
"I merely am trying to chair the Council, whose mission is to snily the
anti-Castro elements inside and outside of Cuba. If the team isn't con-
sidered effective, then change the pitcher. But I believe the Council must
establish itself on Cuban soil, and 2002. Time is against us." Thuunta
del Este agreement will backfire ayalust the U. S. if Castro is allowed.
to remain in Cuba. In a year, after the politicsa of the countries re-
ceiving U. 5. all have gotten their hands on U. S. gold, they will say,
"Thanks to Castro, vre got this. And they will spend it as in the past
with no benefits to the social and economic welfare of the people."
7. Views about the Judges and Lawyera
I queried Dr. AilRO as to his views relative to the podges and
lawyers and their future status. He said he hoped that they could all
reunite and that they could be given assistance as in the past. He do
clared that Dr. ALABAU was not qualified to be a justice and that he was
daing nothing but making politics and trying to discredit the Comcil
and MIRC and VARONA. Dr. MIRO declared that he, as Prime Minister
in the early days of the Castro government, had named LABAL to the
4
Supreme Court, but that now he considered LABAU unfit to hold any
Judicial position.
8. Members of the Revolutionary Council
Dr. MIRO remarked that he had a meeting of the Council an
10 October. I asked what elements now composed it and what he pro-
posed to add. He named the following as presently in the Consejo:
Rescato
30 de Noviembre
MAR
Accion Democratica
20 de Mayo
AAA Independiente
MDC
Montecristi
Ho said he had invited to join:
MRP
Unidad Revolucionaria
and awaited their reply.
He would also like to have the Workers, Students, and the
Professionals (Doctors, Lawyers, etc.) come into the Council. He be-
lieves Batistianos and Comunistas and elements unwilling to cooperato
should be excluded, but that all other groups should be brought together
under the Council,
Ho contends that all anti-Castro activities, except clandestine
and military, should be coordinated by members of the Council, but that
the excepted activities should be known caly to him (MIRO).
9. Probable Argentine Rupture of Relations with Cuba
Dr. MIRO declared that he believed fınıminent the Argentine
rupture of relations with Cuba. He said the Argentine Ambassador to
Cuba (Julio AMOEDO) was ordered to return to Havana (he had been
vacationing in the U. S. after FRONDIZI's visit); that VILLANUEVA, a
Secretary of the Argentine Embassy in Cuba was coming to see MIRO
today; and further that he (MIRC) had received a phone call last night
from a Spaniard (Nicanor FERNANDEZ) in Buenos Aires, urging MIRO
to go to Buenos Aires to arouse anti-Castro sentiment of the people,
Inasmuch as some Argentine action against Cuba appeared imminent.
(FERNANDEZ said he had already written MIRC a letter.) MINO says,
"Of course, I cannot go. I have the Consejo meeting on the 10th.
Furthermore, I am going to New York on October 11th or 12th for the
SIP. (Socloded Interamericana de Frensa) meeting and have been allotted
12 ininutes to address the meeting."
10. MIRO to attend Homage to LACERDA (Brasilian who
Precipitated QUADROS' resignation) on October 15
Dr. MIRO sald he planned to remain in New York City (after
11 and 12 October SIP mooting) until October 15th to attend the hornago
for LACERDA, the Governor of Guanabera province in Brasil, MIRO
probably will stay at the Park Chambore Hotel, but will advise Clark
of his location.
I cominented that I would probably remain in Washington next
week in view of his plans, but that I might go to New York City to meet
with him; if so, I would get in touch with him and arrange a meeting
time and place through Clark.
11. Propaganda Cominission
I asked Dr. MIRO about his ideas on the future organization
and structure of the Propaganda Comnilesion. He stated that it is out-
side the Consejo and not under his direct control, although the Council
accountant has been passing funds to it. He said CARRILLO had resigned
as head of Propaganda and that he would like CONTE AGUERO to handie
it. He claimed that MESTRE had not done anything with propaganda.
12. MIRO's Views Relative to Supreme Court Justice or PRIO
being Recognised as Head of a Provisional Government
I asked Dr. MIRO if he believed that there were many anti-
Castro Cubans (both in and out of Cuba) who lavored PRIC, or the head
of the Supreme Court to be the provisional president if a government were
to be established on Cuban soil. Dr. MIRC declared that the revolution
is a fact, and that practically nobody wants to go back to any former
regime. The people in Cuba would resist any such possibility. He do
6
nounced FRIC's activities against the Council and its efforts to unify
the anti-Castro elements. fie said that the people should be given an
opportunity to elect thoir chief of state after Castro's overthrow and
rocstablishment of order in the island.
13. Cliices of Council (Consejo Revolucionario)
When questioned about his business and private telephones..
MIRO said, "The business phone is also in my house. I have no office
except in my house, but that phone is always busy (JEfferson 2-4680).
So use the other phone (JEfforson 4-2751) when you wish to call me. "
:
"I need to have a small office somewhere away from my home
because all the activities there are driving my wife crazy. I want to
find something modest so that no accusation can be inade of ostentation -
merely a room for myself, one for my secretary, and one for meetinge.
of the Council, atc. The FRD had a place but at that place also was the
press, the refugee center, etc. it would not be satisfactory. The FRD
is now practically dead. It was the forerunner of the Consojo as the
unifying agency of the anti-Castro resistance, "
14. MIRO. Views on Coordinating the Activities of Other Exilo
Groups
After Dr. MIRC reiterated his view that he should be tho
channel for funds and coordinating the activities of groups outside the
Consejo such as the Students, FORD (Labor), etc., I said that I under-
stood that some of those elements were unwilling to function under the
Consejo; and that in view of that situation, did he consider that an.
Activity Committee might be organized with a delegate from each of
these groups and under the chairmanship of a member of the Consejo.
This would serve to coordinato thoir activities, give them a tie-in with
the Consejo, yot not make them subservient to it. Dr. MIRO replied
that this would merely set up another Consejo outside of and parallel to
the existing Consejo. I did not pursue this further, not having enough
background of these organisations to be able to discuss the matter
effectively.
15. Telephone Conversation with MIRO on 7 October
Before my departure from Miami for Washington on 7 October,
I telephaned to Dr. MIRO from the airport. He appreciated the call and
asked if I had seen in the morning paper the action taken yesterday by
7
tho ALABAU Lawyers' group in proclaiming Julio CARCERAN (one
of the chief justices in exile) as "President of Cuba at Var." He ex-
pressed his indignation at this unilateral "political" move by ALADAU
and his adhorents among the exiled lawyers and judges. He added his
best wishes to tre and reminded me that he would probably go to New
York on October 11th or 12th for the SIP (Sociedad Interamericana de
Pronsa) moeting. I replied that I would appreciate if he would contact
Clark after his arrival to give his location in New York City, and that
Clark might have a request from me for an appointment with him,
this seemed desirable. I suggested that in future phone conversations
I would be known as JUANITO. He agreed with pleasure that this would
be a good proceduro. I wished hin Codspeed and he replied likewise
to me.
16. Comment
During these first two meetings I ondeavored to establish
mysell favorably with Dr. MIKO and therebre refrained from bringing
up detalls of budget or opposition to any of his specific proposals.
I listened, asked various questions, and he talked at length.
In future meetings, after I have gained further background and..
bave more policy guidance, I shall be able to discuss with him specifie
Issues and endeavor to reach agreements or compromises, as may be
required.
