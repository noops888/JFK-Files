DAVID M. CURRY, ESQ.
FIRST ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY
WESTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA
633 U.S. POST OFFICE AND COURTHOUSE
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA 15219
DEAR MR. CURRY:
RE: JOSEPH RAYMOND MEROLA
IN RESPONSE TO YOUR LETTER OF MARCH 10, 1977 I WISH TO ADVISE YOU
THAT THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY HAD ONE MEETING WITH JOSEPH RAYMOND
MEROLA PRIOR TO AUGUST 1961. IN LATE 1960 JOSEPH RAYMOND MEROLA MADE
SEVERAL TELEPHONE CALLS TO A CIA OFFICE OFFERING HIS ASSISTANCE IN A GENERAL
WAY IN CONNECTION WITH CUBAN MATTERS, WHICH WAS REFUSED. HOWEVER, ON
6 FEBRUARY 1961 MEROLA CLAIMED TO HAVE INFORMATION ON A LATIN AMERICAN
SENATOR WHO WAS A "CLOSE FRIEND AND CONFIDANT" OF "CHE" GUEVERA. SINCE
GUEVERA WAS LISTED AS BEING THE SUBJECT OF FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE REQUIREMENTS,
THE CIA EMPLOYEE AGREED TO MEET WITH MR. MEROLA. THE MEETING TOOK PLACE ON
6 FEBRUARY 1961 AND IS THE ONLY MEETING WITH MEROLA PRIOR TO HIS INCARCERATION
WHICH YOU STATED IN YOUR LETTER BEGAN IN AUGUST 1961.
MR. MEROLA WAS NOT EMPLOYED BY THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY. HIS
CONTACT WITH THE CIA COULD NOT BE DESCRIBED AS AN UNDERCOVER GOVERNMENT
INFORMANT AS ALLEGED IN THE WRITS OF ERROR CORAM NOBIS BY VICTOR CARLUCCI
AND DANIEL HANNA. THIS ONE CONTACT ON 6 FEBRUARY 1961 BY MEROLA WITH THE
CIA WAS VOLUNTARY ON HIS PART.
MATHEW MC VANE, AN EMPLOYEE OF THE CIA, DID TESTIFY IN SAN DIEGO IN
NOVEMBER 1975 CONCERNING CIA CONTACTS WITH JOSEPH RAYMOND MEROLA. THE
CITATION WE HAVE FOR THAT CASE IS U.S. V. DALTON C. SMITH, ET AL. IN THE
U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, NO. 74-2277-GT.
THE TESTIMONY GIVEN IN THAT TRIAL IS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THE RESPONSE GIVEN
ABOVE. IT IS TRUE THAT AFTER MEROLA WAS RELEASED FROM PRISON HE AGAIN
VOLUNTEERED INFORMATION TO THE CIA. MEROLA WAS A VOLUNTARY SOURCE OF FOREIGN
INTELLIGENCE.
I HOPE THIS PROVIDES SUFFICIENT INFORMATION FOR YOU TO FILE YOUR RESPONSE.
IF NOT, PLEASE CALL ME AT (AC 703) 351-7531.
SINCERELY,

SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE
GENERAL COUNSEL
FROM:
MAURICE A. SOVERN
O/SA/DO/O
SUBJECT:
JOSEPH R. MEROLA
REFERENCE: ASSISTANT UNITED STATES ATTORNEY
PENNSYLVANIA LETTER, 10 MARCH 1977,
SUBJECT AS ABOVE
1. THE QUESTION IN REFERENCE IS THE NATURE OF
ANY INVOLVEMENT OF MEROLA WITH CIA PRIOR TO
AUGUST 1961.
2. THE DIRECTORATE'S FIRST RECORDED CONTACT
WITH JOSEPH RAYMOND MEROLA PRIOR TO AUGUST 1961
OCCURRED ON 6 FEBRUARY 1961. IT FOLLOWED A SERIES
OF TELEPHONE CALLS OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL MONTHS
(LATE 1960 EARLY 1961) IN WHICH MEROLA HAD
EXPRESSED INTEREST IN OFFERING HIS ASSISTANCE IN
CONNECTION WITH CUBAN MATTERS. OUR OFFICER HAD
DECLINED CONTACT UNTIL 6 FEBRUARY WHEN MEROLA
CLAIMED TO HAVE INFORMATION ON A LATIN AMERICAN
SENATOR WHO WAS A "CLOSE FRIEND AND CONFIDANTE"
OF "CHE" GUEVERA. BECAUSE GUEVERA WAS THE PROPER
SUBJECT OF FOREIGN POSITIVE INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION
REQUIREMENT OUR OFFICER AGREED TO A MEETING.
3. THE LAST RECORDED CONTACT, EXCEPT FOR THE
LITIGATION OUTLINED BELOW, WITH MEROLA WAS A TELE-
PHONE CONTACT WITH MEROLA IN LATE JULY 1975 WHEN
HE VOLUNTEERED ADDITIONAL FOREIGN POSITIVE INTEL-
LIGENCE.
4. AT THE END OF AUGUST 1975, MEROLA
CONTACTED A STAFF OFFICER TO ASK FOR TESTIMONY IN
THE CRIMINAL FRAUD TRIAL IN SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA
(U.S. V. JOSEPH R. MEROLA, ET AL, SOUTHERN DISTRICT
OF CALIFORNIA, CR 74-2277-GT) WHICH WE SUBSEQUENTLY
E2 IMPDET
CL BY 012860
FOR CIA OFFICIALS ONLY
PROVIDED ON 13 NOVEMBER 1975.
5. SUBJECT IS CHARACTERIZED AS A VOLUNTARY
OCCASIONAL SOURCE OF FOREIGN POSITIVE INTELLIGENCE
WHO WAS IN SPORADIC CONTACT WITH US.
6. WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE ASSISTANT UNITED
STATES ATTORNEY'S CONCERN FOR THE CONFIDENTIALITY
OF OUR INFORMATION. THE INFORMATION ABOVE MAY BE
MADE AVAILABLE TO THE AUSA AND THE COURT AS
APPROPRIATE WITHOUT FURTHER RESTRICTION.

TRIAL "ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE SERVICE
OF THE GOVERNMENT."
IRVING GREEN, ATTORNEY FOR CARLUCCI
AND HANNA, SAID THE PROSECUTORS, HERBERT
I. TEITELBAUM AND DANIEL J. SNYDER, KNEW
MEROLA WAS A GOVERNMENT AGENT AND THEREFORE
"PERPETRATED A FRAUD UPON THE U.S. COURT."
TEITELBAUM AND SNYDER ARE NOW FEDERAL
JUDGES IN PITTSBURGH AND HAVE NOT COMMENTED
ABOUT THE ACTION FILED BY GREEN, WHICH IS STILL
PENDING. BUT OFFICIALS FAMILIAR WITH THEIR
POSITIONS AND THE TWO JUDGES WILL, IF NECESSARY,
SWEAR THEY DID NOT KNOW MEROLA WAS A
GOVERNMENT AGENT.
CUBAN CONNECTION
"THE ANSWER TO THIS WHOLE THING REVOLVES
AROUND CUBA," SAID THIS OFFICIAL.
GREEN, WHO REPRESENTS MARINARINO'S SON-IN-LAW,
SAID HE DIDN'T THINK MEROLA'S TESTIMONY IN CHICAGO
HAD BEEN PARTICULARLY "HELPFUL" TO THE PROSECUTION.
A "MORE LOGICAL ASSUMPTION" IS THAT MEROLA WAS
FREED FROM PRISON BECAUSE OF WHAT HE COULD DO FOR
THE GOVERNMENT IN CUBA, HE SAID.
"THIS GUY WORKS ANYWHERE HE WANTS TO," SAID
GREEN. "THE GOVERNMENT HAS PROTECTED HIM IN
CALIFORNIA, CHICAGO AND EVERYWHERE ELSE. HE STILL
HAS TO BE OF VALUE TO THE GOVERNMENT."
ONE THING IS CERTAIN: MEROLA IS WELL KNOWN IN
THE MIAMI CUBAN COMMUNITY AND AMONG THOSE WHO
HAVE BEEN LINKED TO ALLEGED CASTRO ASSASSINATION
ATTEMPTS.
"JOE WAS AN UNDERCOVER AGENT, HE WAS CLOSELY
ASSOCIATED WITH THE GOVERNMENT," FRANK STURGIS, OF
MIAMI, TOLD THE BULLETIN, "HE DID HAVE AN
ASSOCIATION WITH THE CIA."
STURGIS, WHO GAINED NOTORIETY AS ONE OF THOSE
CONVICTED IN THE WATERGATE BURGLARY, WAS AN ANTI-
CASTRO LIEUTENANT DURING THE REVOLUTION WHO SERVED
AS A DOUBLE AGENT FOR THE CIA. HE LATER WORKED
AGAINST CASTRO IN THE BAY OF PIGS OPERATION AND HAS
ADMITTED PLOTTING TO KILL CASTRO.
"I KNOW JOE WAS INVOLVED WITH THE REVOLUTIONARIES,"
SAID STURGIS, "I KNOW HE HAD AN ASSOCIATION WITH
THE CIA, BUT BECAUSE OF COMPARTMENTALIZATION, YOU
DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING."
TIED TO BURGLAR
A SOURCE CLOSE TO THE HOUSE ASSASSINATIONS COMMITTEE SAID MEROLA WAS
"A GOOD FRIEND" OF FUGERIA (ROLANDO) MARTINEZ, ANOTHER OF THOSE CONNECTED
WITH THE WATERGATE BURGLARY. MARTINEZ IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CIA IN THE
BAY OF PIGS EFFORT AND IN OTHER ANTI- CASTRO MOVES.
"JOE'S PLACE IN MIAMI BEACH WAS ON THE WATER AND IT WAS USED BY ANTI-
CASTRO GROUPS TO SMUGGLE ARMS TO CUBA," THIS SOURCE SAID. "MARTINEZ WAS ONE OF
THEM."
"I CAN'T RECALL," MARTINEZ SAID, WHEN ASKED BY THE BULLETIN ABOUT
USING MEROLA'S DOCK. "REALLY, I CAN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
"HE WAS CONNECTED WITH HELPING PEOPLE HERE IN MIAMI AGAINST THE DICTATORSHIP
OF BATISTA. HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN SOME OTHER BRANCH THAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT."
ALFREDO BORGES, A MIAMI BUSINESS CONSULTANT AND A BAY OF PIGS VETERAN, TOLD A
BULLETIN REPORTER INQUIRING ABOUT MEROLA TO "PLEASE WRITE ME A LETTER."
"I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE," BORGES SAID. "I CANNOT TALK OVER THE TELEPHONE."
ONE INVESTIGATOR INTERESTED IN MEROLA SAID THE MATTER IS "VERY SENSITIVE, RECORDS
ARE HARD TO COME BY."
"HE SEEMS TO DO EVERYTHING," THIS INVESTIGATOR SAID. "HE'S A PILOT, HE
SPEAKS SPANISH, HE KNOWS CUBA AND HE'S CONNECTED. BUT NOBODY WANTS TO COOPERATE."
A SCARED MAN
RECORDS INDEED ARE HARD TO COME BY. OFFICIAL AND UNOFFICIAL ATTEMPTS TO
OBTAIN COMPLETE RECORDS OF MEROLA'S ARRESTS PROVED FRUITLESS. SO DID EFFORTS
TO DETERMINE WHAT ENCOUNTERS HE MIGHT HAVE HAD WITH OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE FOR
WATCHING THE NATION'S BORDERS.
BUT DESPITE THE BELIEF OF SOME THAT MEROLA ENJOYS THE PROTECTION OF THE
GOVERNMENT WHILE AT THE SAME TIME BEING WELCOMED BY ORGANIZED CRIME, THOSE WHO
KNOW HIM SAY THAT IS NOT THE CASE.
"JOE HAS GOT A LITTLE MONEY," SAID ONE FLORIDA ACQUAINTANCE. "I DON'T KNOW
WHERE HE GETS IT. BUT HE'S AN INFORMER AND THEY HATE INFORMERS. THE MAN IS
CONCERNED.
"HE GOES AROUND DADE (COUNTY), BUT HE IS VERY, VERY CAREFUL WHERE HE GOES. JOE IS SCARED."

SUBJECT: COURT APPEARANCE ON 13 NOVEMBER 1975, SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA
1. ON 13 NOVEMBER 1975, MATT MACVANE APPEARED AS A WITNESS FOR THE
DEFENSE AT THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF
CALIFORNIA, 325 WEST F STREET, SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA. THE CASE WAS THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA V. DALTON C. SMITH, ET AL. MACVANE WAS CALLED
TO TESTIFY BY E. MAC AMOS JR., ATTORNEY FOR DEFENDANT JOE MEROLA. IN
HONOR OF THE SCENARIO MACVANE APPEARED AT THE COURT. ON 13 NOVEMBER 1975
AT APPROXIMATELY 15:30 HOURS SAN DIEGO TIME MACVANE WAS CALLED TO THE
WITNESS STAND.
2. MAC AMOS, ATTORNEY FOR DEFENDANT JOE MEROLA BEGAN QUESTIONING
AFTER MACVANE WAS SWORN IN AS A WITNESS. AMOS ASKED HOW LONG MACVANE
HAD BEEN EMPLOYED BY THE CIA? HE ASKED IF MACVANE KNEW DEFENDANT MEROLA?
HE ASKED IF MACVANE WERE TOLD BY MEROLA ABOUT A SHIPMENT OF SURPLUS
HELICOPTER PARTS GOING TO THE COUNTRY OF EL SALVADOR? HE ASKED MACVANE
IF MEROLA HAD VOLUNTEERED OTHER INFORMATION TO THE AGENCY? HE THEN ASKED
IF MEROLA WERE EVER PAID FOR SUCH INFORMATION? AMOS ALSO TRIED TO ESTABLISH
THE VALUE OF SURPLUS PARTS IN LATIN AMERICA COMPARED TO THE U.S. THIS WAS
OBJECTED TO BY ATTORNEY ROBERT THALLER, PROSECUTOR IN THE CASE. THE JUDGE
SUSTAINED THE OBJECTION AND MACVANE DID NOT HAVE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION.
AMOS FINISHED HIS QUESTIONING AND THALLER BEGAN A SHORT CROSS EXAMINATION.
THALLER ASKED IF MACVANE EVER HEARD MEROLA MENTION STOCKS? HE ALSO ASKED
IF MACVANE KNEW THE NAME OF THE CORPORATION THAT MEROLA REPRESENTED? HE
THEN POINTED OUT THAT EVEN IF SOME STOCK FRAUD WERE OCCURRING, MACVANE
WOULD NOT BE WRONG BECAUSE MACVANE WAS NOT AN INVESTIGATOR, BUT RATHER
A COLLECTOR OF FOREIGN INFORMATION. THE CROSS EXAMINATION THEN ENDED.
ALL QUESTIONS WERE ANSWERED TO THE BEST OF MACVANE'S ABILITY AND KNOWLEDGE.
3. THERE APPEARED TO BE LITTLE PURPOSE IN THE APPEARANCE OF MACVANE
BECAUSE IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT MACVANE KNEW NOTHING OF ANY VALUE CONCERNING
THE CASE. MACLANE'S TOTAL TIME ON THE WITNESS STAND WAS ABOUT 10 MINUTES.
AFTER COMPLETION OF HIS TESTIMONY MACVANE WAS RELEASED.

SUBJECT: JOSEPH RAYMOND MEROLA
OGC 75-1073
5 NOVEMBER 1975
1. ON 3 NOVEMBER I TALKED TO MR. MATT MC VANE, DCD OFFICER
STATIONED IN MIAMI, AND HE SAID THAT HE HAD RECEIVED THE SUBPOENA
FROM E. MAC AMOS, JR. TO APPEAR AS A DEFENSE WITNESS IN THE TRIAL IN
SAN DIEGO ON 11 NOVEMBER. MR. MC VANE AGREED TO COME TO HEADQUARTERS
ON 6 NOVEMBER TO DISCUSS THE INFORMATION IN THE FILES AND MR. ROBERT
STARLING OF DCD AGREED TO JOIN IN THE MEETING. MR. MC VANE TOLD ME
THAT LT. COLONEL DOUGLAS W. HALDANE, WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN ON
DETAIL TO THE DCD MIAMI OFFICE, HAD RETURNED TO THE ARMY AND WAS
CURRENTLY ASSIGNED SOMEWHERE IN EUROPE AND THAT HIS ADDRESS WAS
HEADQUARTERS, USARSUR, APO NEW YORK, NEW YORK 09403.
2. SINCE THIS OFFICE HAD RECEIVED A LETTER FROM MR. AMOS WITH A
REQUEST FOR THE CURRENT ADDRESS OF COLONEL HALDANE, I CALLED MR. AMOS
ON 4 NOVEMBER AND EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT COLONEL HALDANE WAS NO LONGER
WITH THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY AND IT WAS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT
COLONEL HALDANE WAS STATIONED IN EUROPE. MR. AMOS DID NOT WANT THE
CURRENT ADDRESS OF COLONEL HALDANE. HE DID STATE, HOWEVER, THAT MR.
MC VANE WOULD NOT BE NEEDED IN SAN DIEGO UNTIL WEDNESDAY MORNING,
12 NOVEMBER. AS THINGS STOOD NOW, MR. MEROLA WAS THE FIFTH DEFENDANT
AND IT WOULD BE THAT LENGTH OF TIME BEFORE MR. MC VANE'S TESTIMONY WOULD
BE NEEDED.
3. MR. MC VANE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD BEEN CALLED BY MR. ROBERT
THALLER OF THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN CALIFORNIA. I TOLD MR. MC VANE
THAT I WOULD CONTACT MR. THALLER. I CALLED MR. THALLER WHO IS A MEMBER
OF THE ORGANIZED CRIME STRIKE FORCE, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, ROOM 2307,
300 NORTH LOS ANGELES STREET, LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA 90012, TELEPHONE
NO. (AC 213) 688-5808. MR. THALLER WAS PLEASED TO HEAR THAT MR. MC VANE
WAS BEING MADE AVAILABLE TO TESTIFY AND EXPLAINED THAT HE THOUGHT MR.
AMOS HAD ALREADY PREPARED A MOTION TO DISMISS IF MR. MC VANE WAS TO BE
DENIED AS A WITNESS FOR THE DEFENSE. I EXPLAINED TO MR. THALLER THAT MR.
MC VANE WAS COMING TO HEADQUARTERS ON THURSDAY, 6 NOVEMBER, AND SAID
THAT WE WOULD CALL HIM TO DISCUSS THE ROLE MR. MC VANE PLAYED IN RECEIVING
INFORMATION FROM MR. MEROLA.
4. IF THIS CASE RUNS PARALLEL TO MANY CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS, THE
DEFENSE MAY NEVER PUT MR. MC VANE ON THE STAND WHEN HE ACTUALLY SHOWS
UP AS THIS MAY PROVE DETRIMENTAL TO THEIR DEFENSE. HOWEVER, WE SHOULD
BE PREPARED FOR HIS TESTIMONY IF, IN FACT, IT DOES TAKE PLACE.
