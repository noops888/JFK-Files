Through Liaison channels, Bureau determined that
Conein is currently a covert employee of CIA, under the cover
of a State Department employee. He is presently in Saigon,
South Vietnam, on an extremely sensitive assignment. CIA
has requested that no information be furnished to the French
regarding his affiliation with CIA or with regard to his
present whereabouts
For your information, Richmond determined (by a
pretext telephone call) from the present occupant of
1111 Ingelside Avenue, McLean, Virginia, who is presently
renting this residence from Conein, that the latter is a
retired Lieutenant Colonel from the U. S. Army and is
presently working and assigned to the U. S. Embassy in Saigon.
No arrest records were located for Conein in either
Arlington County or Fairfax County, Virginia. Records of the
Credit Bureau, Incorporated, of Washington, DC., reveal a
credit report dated 9/21/65, indicating that Lucien Conein,
of 1111 Ingelside Avenue, McLean, Virginia, was then married
to Ebjette and divorced from Carmen (last nam, not-shown).
