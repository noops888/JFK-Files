Subject: Examination of Principal Sources of Policy
and Contingency Planning on Cuba
In accordance with your instructions, over the week-end
I have reviewed the main sources of policy on Cuba. The problem
as I define it as follows:
The Problem:
Prior to the establishment of the Interdepartmental Coordinat-
ing Committee of Cuban Affairs, much work bed been done on Cuba,
both in the policy and contingency fields. The purpose of the
current exercise is to review and identify the main sources of
such policy and contingency planning in an effort to determine
if any of the work previously done will be of value to the
officers of your committee as we go forward with implementation
of the newly stated Cuban policy and objectives.
Sources of Policy and Contingency Planning:
The principal sources of policy and contingency planning
which may or may not be of value to the work of your committee ere
as follows:
1. The National Security Action Hemorenda emenating
from the White House.
2. The Actions of the National Security Council.
3. The Eesia National Security Policy of the U.S.
(now avaiting final stages of formal elecrance
before presentation to National Security Council).
4. The Records
NW 50955 DocId:32276061 Page 4
SECRET - SENSITIVE
4. The Records of Action of the Executive Committee
of the National Security Council as they pertain
to Cuba.
5. The Reports of the Sub-Committees of EXCOM -
curing the Cuban Crisis.
6. The Resolutions of the Organization of American
States and the Punta del Este Conference.
7. Public Statements of Government Officials, in
Particuler Press Conference of President Kennedy
of September 13, 1962.
8. Meeting of Secretary Rusk with Foreign Ministero
of Latin America during Cuban Crisis.
9. Recently Approved New Policy Statement and
Objectives en Drews Up by the Interdepartmental
Comittee of Cuban Affairs.
10. Ouben Guidelines Paper.
(A guidelines paper es such does not exist on
Cuba os is the case in a majority of other
countries.)
CONCLUSIONS:
There are well over eight volumes of material concerned with
Cuba, perticalerly thet generated during the recent October crisis.
This review is nearing completion, and I en segregating particular
reports which may be of value to the members of your comittee
as we go forward with implementation of the new policy and
objectives. In the attached documentation, I have segregated
those National Security Council decisions and National Security
Action Memoranda which are carried es pending or closed in the
files of the Department of Stete. Where action on a particular
MSC decision or NASAM has been transferred to EXOOM, action
responsibility on these decisions would appear now to be within
the purview of your Coordinating Committee. From my review
to date,
NW 50955 DocId: 32276061 Page 5
SECRET - SENSITIVE
to date, it appears that all of these decisions call for actions
which have already been considered by your Committee. You will
note that in some instances cction responsibility on an NSC
decision or NASAM has been transferred to the Special Group
(Mr. Alexis Johnson).

MEMORANDUM FOR THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL'S EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
(Prepared for the Meeting of Friday, January 25, 1963, 4 p.m.)
FROM
Coordinator of Cuban Affairs
SUBJECT: United States Policy Toward Cuba
United States Policy
On November 20, the President set forth the broad guide-
lines of United States policy with respect to Cuba in the
following words:
"As for our part, if all offensive weapons systems are
removed from Cuba and kept out of the hemisphere in
the future, under adequate verification and safeguards,
and if Cuba is not used for the export of aggressive
communist purposes, there will be peace in the
Caribbean. And, as I said in September, 'we shall
neither initiate nor permit aggression in this
hemisphere.'
"We will not, of course, abandon the political,
economic and other efforts of this hemisphere to halt
subversion from Cuba, nor our purpose and hope that
the Cuban people shall some day be truly free. But
these policies are very different from any intent to
launch a military invasion of the island."
NW 50955 DocId:32276061 Page 15
SECRET
Objectives
SECRET
-2-
Accordingly, the objectives of United States
policy with respect to Cuba are:
1.
Protecting the security of the United States
and the other states of the Organization of
American States (OAS) by assuring that
offensive weapons are not reintroduced into
Cuba;
2. Removal of remaining Soviet forces from Cuba;
3. Preventing Cuba from taking any aggressive
military action against other Caribbean states;
4. Reducing the capabilities of the Castro regime
to direct and support subversion and insurrection
within the other Hemisphere states;
5. Encouraging and supporting any developments within
Cuba that offer the possibility of divorcing
the Cuban Government from its support of Sino-
Soviet Communist purposes;
6. Encouraging and supporting any developments
within Cuba that offer the possibility of
replacing the Cuban Government with a regime
that would break with the Sino-Soviet Bloc,
it being understood that our ultimate
objective is replacement of the regime by
one fully compatible with the goals of the
United States;
NW 50955 DocId:32276061 Page 16
SECRET
SECRET
-3-
7. Maximizing the cost to the Soviet Union of
supporting the Castro regime;
8. Maximizing the political isolation of the
Castro regime from other free world states,
and especially from states of the OAS.
Whenever possible, U. S. actions against Cuba
should be multilateral, preferably based upon
the Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Pact)
or on resolutions adopted by the Organization
of American States. The newly-won hemispheric
solidarity on the Cuban issue should not be
jeopardized by seeking OAS actions of marginal
value and which might split the hemisphere;
9. Being prepared to meet, with the employment of
appropriate U. S. combat elements and/or
logistical support, the wide variety of
military contingencies that may arise from
pursuit of the foregoing objectives; and
10. Producing comprehensive intelligence related
to the above objectives.
Supporting Actions
A. To achieve the foregoing objectives, the
U. S. Government will be prepared to increase
the political economic, psychological and
military pressures, as appropriate opportunities
present themselves or can be created. The
actions listed below are those requiring immediate
approval and would be initiated in the sequence
set forth below. Recommendations for further
NW 50955 DocId:32276061 Page 17

actions based upon the re-examination of
existing programs and upon the development
of new programs related to the foregoing
objectives will be forthcoming.
1.
In addition to current covert program, such
as intelligence collection, recruitment of
Cuban officials as agents, radio broadcasts,
support of the Cuban Revolutionary Council(CRC)
and other exile group activities and infil-
tration of propaganda materials:
a.
b.
Intensify covert collection
of intelligence within Cuba, especially
within the regime;
Support the efforts of certain Cuban
exiles, who are associated with
the original aims of the 26 of July
Movement and who believe that the
Castro regime can be overthrown from
within in order that they may:
1) cause a split in the leadership
of the regime at the national or
provincial levels; and 2) create a
political base of popular opposition
to the regime; and, 3) secure
intelligence;
c. Assist Cuban exiles in developing a
capability to launch balloons carrying
leaflets and other propaganda materials
from international waters into Cuba.
Launch propaganda balloons after an
established.

2. With respect to the actions listed below,
the results of Mr. Donovan's imminent
negotiations with Fidel Castro for freeing
the 20-odd American prisoners should first
be ascertained. If these actions were taken
before the conclusion of the negotiations
they could jeopardize the release of the
Americans.
3.
If these negotiations fail, or when the
prisoners are recovered, proceed on the
following timetable:
4. Inform NATO and OAS twelve hours in advance
of the proclamation of the four point
shipping orders. (The proclamation calls for
the orders to go into effect in five days).
These orders:
a.
Close United States ports to all
vessels of a country whose vessels
engage in carrying arms to Cuba;
b. Close United States ports to any ship
which has carried goods in the Bloc-
Cuba trade within 120 days of the time
it seeks to enter a United States port;
c.
Prohibit all United States flag ships
and all ships owned by United States
nationals or residents from entering
any ports of Cuba and from carrying
any goods bound to or from Cuba; and
NW 50955 DocId:32276061 Page 19
SECRET
SECRET
-6-
d. Prohibit any cargo sponsored by any
department of the United States from
being shipped on vessels owned or
controlled by persons who own or
control vessels engaged in the trade
between Cuba and the Soviet Bloc.
5. At the termination of the U. S. Chiefs of
Mission Conference - January 20-30, or at
a later date dependent on the Donovan
mission, Assistant Secretary Martin, or
another representative of the President
will visit the Presidents of Chile, Mexico
and Brazil to convey to them the importance
President Kennedy attaches to maintaining
hemispheric solidarity by their supporting
the following resolutions:
a. An OAS resolution condemning Cuba for
its actions which continue to endanger
the peace, deploring refusal to allow
inspection, condemning the presence of
Soviet troops, recommending continued
surveillance and continued vigilance
against subversive activities, and
terminating the invocation of the Rio
Treaty on the missile crisis, together
with
b. An OAS resolution which would
recommend 1) extension of arms embargo
to all items of trade except food and
medicine (fall back position: extension
of arms embargo to all strategic items);
NW 50955 DocId:32276061 Page 20
SECRET
SECRET
-7-
2) prohibition of ships of OAS
member states from transportating
embargoed items and deny use of
ports to ships in Bloc-Cuba trade;
3) denial of Soviet over-flights and
transit rights for flights to Cuba;
and 4) a call on other states to
take similar action.
6. After obtaining the maximum possible
support of the key countries of Mexico,
Chile and Brazil, the other OAS
members will be approached in Washington
and in their respective capitals,
simultaneously. It should be possible
for this consultation and OAS action on
the resolutions to be completed within
ten days. Prior to formal COAS approval
of the resolutions, we will inform our
NATO allies of the impending OAS action.
7. At the first NATO meeting after formal
OAS action on the resolutions, we will
request that NATO include Cuba on the
list of countries to which shipment
of COCOM list (strategic) items prohibited.
8. After NATO decision on our COCOM request,
we will seek to get agreement from Free
World industrial nations to prevent
shipping of critical spare parts and
equipment to Cuba, not on the COCOM list.
9.
In addition to the four point shipping
resolutions, and action under Section
107 of the Foreign Assistance Act, continue
to press Free World nations to keep their
shipping out of Bloc-Cuba trade.

B.
Contigency Planning
New opportunities for accomplishing our
objectives may arise either as a result of Bloc
action in other parts of the world; as a
result of aggressive moves (or isolated hostile actions)
by the Castro-Communist regime itself; or as a
result of uprisings or internal conflict within
Cuba.
Our contingency planning, which will be
undertaken immediately, should include preparations
for increased multilateral and/or bilateral
political and economic measures, large scale use of
Cubans who are now inside Cuba; more extensive
air activity including both high and low level
flights primarily directed toward surveillance
and collection of intelligence, and which may also
have the effect of embarrassing the Castro
government and keeping the Castro forces on
continual alert; retaliatory measures, as
appropriate, including the imposition of a
POL blockade; harrassment of Cuban officials in
other countries; severance of communications
to Cuba; major acts of sabotage on shipping
destined for Cuba and on key installations to
Cuba; intensive naval patrols; and, ultimately,
the use of U. S. military force. To the extent
feasible, U. S. military forces employed against
Cuba should be accompanied by U. S. militarily-
trained free Cubans and by the armed forces of
those Latin American nations desirous of
participating in the U. S. effort.
NW 50955 DocId:32276061 Page 22

Our programs should be designed to encourage
the Brigade members to melt back into the exile
community and engage in constructive pursuits
pending the liberation of Cuba. We should offer
them some special assistance but not to the extent
that they become a perpetual privileged class
within the community. Presidential action on their
behalf would single them out unnecessarily.

SUBJECT:
Coordinator of Cuban Affairs
Summary of Coordinator's Recommendations
1. U. S. Policy Objectives
The following are the objectives of the U. S. with

a.
Protecting the security of the United States
and the other states of the Organization of
American States by assuring that offensive
weapons are not reintroduced into Cuba;
b. Removal of remaining Soviet forces from Cuba;

Preventing Cuba from taking any aggressive
military action against other Caribbean states;

Encouraging and supporting any developments
within Cuba that offer the possibility of
divorcing the Cuban Government from its
support of Sino-Soviet Communist purposes;
f. Encouraging and supporting any developments
within Cuba that offer the possibility of
replacing the Cuban Government with a regime
that would break with the Sino-Soviet Bloc, it

being understood that our ultimate objective
is replacement of the regime by one fully
compatible with the goals of the United States;
g. Maximizing the cost to the Soviet Union of
supporting the Castro regime;
h. Maximizing the political isolation of the
Castro regime from other free world states,
and especially from states of the OAS. When-
ever possible, U. S. actions against Cuba should
be multilateral, preferably based upon the
Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Pact) or on
resolutions adopted by the Organization of
American States. The newly-won hemispheric
solidarity on the Cuban issue should not be
jeopardized by seeking OAS actions of marginal
value and which might split the hemisphere;
i. Being prepared to meet, with the employment
of appropriate U. S. combat elements and/or
logistical support, the wide variety of
military contingencies that may arise from
pursuit of the foregoing objectives; and
j. Producing comprehensive intelligence related
to the above objectives.
2. Supporting Actions
Actions in support of these objectives and their
time sequence are set forth in the attached paper
entitled "U. S. Policy Toward Cuba." They include the
four point shipping regulations, OAS sanctions, NATO

action to include Cuba on the COCOM list, and approaches
to Free World industrial nations to eliminate sale and
shipment of critical items from their Cuban trade.
Existing programs will be reviewed and further
recommendations made as necessary. Planning for the
variety of contingencies related to Cuba will be undertaken
at once.
In addition to current covert programs such as
intelligence collection, recruitment of Cuban officials,
support of the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC) and
other exile activities, infiltration of propaganda
materials, and radio broadcasts, the following are
recommended for approval and immediate initiation:
a.
b.
intensified covert collection of intelligence
within Cuba, especially within the regime;
support of Cuban exiles who are seeking to
return the 26 of July Movement to its
original aims.
NOTE: It should be noted that approval of the
foregoing actions may impair our ability
to accomplish objective b. (Removal of
remaining Soviet forces from Cuba) because
taking these actions could provide the
U.S.S.R. with rationale for maintaining
its forces in Cuba. Nevertheless, approval
of the foregoing actions is recommended.
3. Cuban Brigade
Brigade leaders should be induced to accept a
specially tailored civilian and military program for
Brigade members.
NW 50955 DocId: 32276061 Page 26

The Brigade should be disbanded as a military unit
and individual members urged to accept civilian training
or to enlist in the existing U. S. military program
for Cubans and join a Brigade reserve unit thereafter.
Our moral obligation would be discharged to the Brigade
members and creation of a privileged class in the exile
community would be avoided.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL'S EXECUTIVE
COMMITTEE
FROM
Coordinator of Cuban Affairs
SUBJECT: United States Policy Toward Cuba
United States Policy
On November 20, the President set forth the broad guidelines of
United States policy with respect to Cuba in the following words:
"As for our part, if all offensive weapons systems are
removed from Cuba and kept out of the hemisphere in
the future, under adequate verification and safeguards,
and if Cuba is not used for the export of aggressive
communist purposes, there will be peace in the Caribbean.
And, as I said in September, 'we shall neither initiate
nor permit aggression in this hemisphere'.
"We will not, of course, abandon the political, economic
and other efforts of this hemisphere to halt subversion
from Cuba, nor our purpose and hope that the Cuban people
shall some day be truly free. But these policies are very
different from any intent to launch a military invasion of
the island."
Objectives
Accordingly, the objectives of U.S. policy with respect to Cuba
are:
1. Protecting the security of the United States and the
other states of the Organization of American States
(OAS) by assuring that offensive weapons are not
reintroduced into Cuba;

2. Romoval of remaining Soviet forcoo from Cuba;
3. Preventing Cuba from taking any aggressive military
action against other Caribbean otatoo;
4. Reducing the capabilition of the Castro regime to direct
and oupport oubvorcion and inourrection within the
other OAS otateo;
5. Encouraging and supporting any developmento within
Cuba that offer the possibility of livorcing the Cuban
Government from ito support of Sino-Soviet Communist
purposes or replacing the Government with a regime
which would accomplish thio purpose;
6. Maximising the cost to the Soviet Union of supporting
the Castro rogime;
7. Maximizing the political isolation of the Castro regime
from other free world states, and especially from
states of the OAS. Whenever possible, U.S. actions
against Cuba should be multilateral, preferably based
upon the Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Pact)
or on resolutiono adopted by the Organization of
American States. The newly-won hemispheric
solidarity on the Cuban issue should not be jeopardized
by seeking OAS actions of marginal value and which
might split the hemisphero.
8. Being prepared to meet, with the employment of
appropriate U.S. combat olomento and/or logistical
support, the wide variety of military contingencies
that may arise from purouit of the foregoing objectives;

Isolating, undermining and discrediting the Castro/Communist
