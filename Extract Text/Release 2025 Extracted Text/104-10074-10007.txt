Dear Itr. Hoove
Himmaraly
With reference to your letter of 11 June 1947 requesting
information on policy matters discussed by Foster and certain
members of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party
in Paris, I should like to an sumarise the action taken by thie
on Foster'
ganisation on Foster's trip. A trip. All stations on
itinerary were alerted during the British Empire Conference with
emphasis placed upon Foster's contacts and the content of hمن
conversations with foreign Gommunist afric officiala at Paris, Bol
The first reaction from Paris reported Foster's meeting with
Thores and Duclos and on 7 Be and a planned nesting for the next
day with other nimbars mbars of the Central Committee 1. Committee (this information
was distributed to you in DD-3658 on 9-3658 on 4 April 1947). No adequate
follow-up on this original report was subsequently produced - a
fact to be accounted for primarily by the hesitation of the Surete
Nationale, for political reasons, to give Foster's visit adequate
investigative attention (as reported t to you you in DB-4777 of 1 July
1947),
24
Information on the policy matters discussed at this nesting,
however, was r, was included in a report from H.I.6, Section 7, in May
)copy enclosed herewith). Although the source of tمنط of this report did
not know precisely what happened at this meeting "because
secrecy sas observed, he mentioned several specific topics
allegedly under discussion. This report was not forwarded to you
since it was assumed the report i wie handed directly to your London 24
representative by the British.

this connection, the French Communist leaders are said to have
very much regretted the difficulty of bringing about the union
between the American Federation of Labour, and the Congress of
