DAS BEEN MISERABLE FAILURE THE JEASURED AGAINSTYORIGINAL
:
OBJECTIVE OF 2000 TECES FROM WESTERN EUROPE ALONE TEOUCH CUR
FIGURES NOT COMPLETE, WE ESTIMATE PROBABLY LESS THAN FIFTY
CANDIDATES HAVE RECEIVED CONTRACT APPROVAL AND WE ABLE CONFIRI
ADOUT TEN WHO HAVE ACTUALLY MADE IT TO THE ISLAND. KUFARK
SUCCEEDED IN INSERTING ABOUT THIRTY RECRUITED TECES INTO THE
VARIOUS BIRING CHANNELS, BUT SO FAR ONLY THO EAVE RECEIVED CONTRACT
APPROVAL FROM HA VÀ
2 CUEAN FAILURE TO RECRUIT IN SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS APPEARS
DUE LARGELY TO RELUCTANCE FOREIGN MINISTRY AND FOREIGN SERVICE
OFFICERS PURSUE TECH RECRUITING MISSION AGGRESSIVELY, BUREAUCRATIC
INCOMPETENCE IN HAVANA, FEAR OF INFILTRATION OF BOSTILE ACEITS

PAGEABLE LOSS OF INTEREST IN THE PROGRAM ON PART OF CASTRO
LIMSELF. THESE FACTORS WHICH EMERGE FROM OUR STUDY OF THE CUBAN
PERFORMANCE ACCOUNT FOR LACK OF RESPONSE FROM EMBASSIES. TO
APPLICATIONS, LONG DELAY IN GETTING WORD BACK FROU HAVANA AND
SILALL NUMBER OF TECHS ULTIMATELY FIRED, LONG TIME LAC BETWEEN
INITIAL APPLICATION AND ULTIMATE APPROVAL FROM HAVA, WHICH RUNS
SIX TO WINE MONTHS, EAS COST CUBANS NUMBER OF TECHS WEO WERE
INITIALLY EAGER CUT SUBSEQUENTLY LOST INTEREST OR TOOK OTHER
JOBS.
3. IN FACE OF FOREGOING WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT FORTHWEILE
1
TO CONTINUE INTENSIVE SEARCH FOR ZPPRIXA CANDIDATES FOR INSERTION
-FISE STRESS
INTO CUBAN HIRING CHANNEL. /STATIONS WITH ACTIVE LEADS SHOULD STAY
WITH THEM IN THE HOPE THEY MAY STILL BE HIRED, BUT CEASE EFFORTS
TO GENERATE LEADS FROM SCRATCH. ON OTHER HAND, THERE ARE FAIR
NUMBER NON BLOC TECHS IN CUBA AND IT LIKELY CULANS WILL CONTINUE
TO HIRE NEEDED TECHS ON LIMITED SELECTIVE BASIS AS THEY DID PRIOR
TO ZEPRIMA PROGRAM. STATIONS THEREFORE ARE URGED TO CONTINUE BE
ALERT FOR SUCH OPPORTUNITIES AND TO EXPLOIT TE IN SANGS HAFNER
AS ALL OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO PLACE RESIDENT AGENTS IN CUBA.
