Republic as chief of Station
Mr. Schwarz. And then
Mr. Phillips. I stayed in the Dominican Republic until
the summer of 1967.
And after that I returned to Washington and became
the Chief of Cuban Operations through 1969.
In 1970 I went to Rio de JanierodaseStation Chief And

in 1971, I suffered the traumatic shock of being moved to
Brasilia from Rio de Janiero.

In 1972 I went to Venezuela as the Chief of Station

And in the summer of 1973 I was asked to return as Chief of

the then Western Hemisphere Division.

to his attitude toward either the subject of assassination or
the question as to what kind of an explicit order would be
necessary in order to justify Agency actions to actually
assassinate some one.
6
Mr. Phillips. No, because I never heard Mr. Helms even
7
8
get that close to the edge of such talk about such and such an
option or possibility, I never heard him talk that way.

Under traumatic conditions I have heard
human beings maybe with a few drinks or something like that
saying, my God, we would be better off if so and so were
bumped off or something.
But I have never heard two officers sit down and
seriously talk about such an option. And if anyone has ever
said that, it is the same way some people might get out of line
and say almost anything.
19
Mr. Schwarz.
Did you ever hear, in connection with
20
21
22
the Chile operation, that certain Chilean officers, specifi-
cally a Major Marshall, report reported to the CIA that they intended
to assassinate Allende?
23
24
Mr. Phillips. It was five years ago. But as I recall,
Major Marshall said a number of things. He was what I think
of as a wild man.

I seem to recall something about, yes, a

Mr. Phillips. That is ture.
Mr. Schwarz. And those were going to be used in a
kidnapping effort by the Valenzuela group, and you knew that,
didn't you?
Mr. Phillips. I recall that they were going to be
used by the group, and that kidnapping was a part of their
plans. I can't recall that they said they needed them spe-
cifically for the kidnapping. I do recall that the reason was
the automatic reaction from Latin America is, why do people
need arms when they have got arms everywhere all over Latin
America.
And they said something about, their own arms could be
identified, and they needed some that couldn't be identified.
I don't recall if it was specifically mentioned that it was
just for that. It was certainly understood that they might

Consequently, I personally made this proposal, that we
establish what I called a false flag base of people that would
go from outside, and should there be any sort of flap, the
chances of linking it to the U.S. Government would be much
less, because they would appear to be from another nationality.
is
Mr. Schwarz. I would like to read to you a cable
this cable of 27 September in the Senator's book? I know that
he asked for it after I came over.
Mr. Treverton.
It is not.
Mr. Schwarz. I am going to read from a cable which
unfortunately is not in your book, but the key part is
relatively simple.
This is a cable, Mr. Phillips, dated September 27, 1970,
and it is signed by yourself and Mr. Broe. And it is sent to
the Station in Chile, and it contains the following about the
purposes of setting up the false flag office
Mr. Phillips. We call it a base.
Mr. Schwarz. False flag bases: "Each member of base
will enter and leave Chile with falst documents and operate as
a representative of his country rather than as anAmerican".
That is right, isn't it?
Mr. Phillips. That is true.
Mr. Schwarz. Continue:
"Having at least one key Brazilian and one key Argentinian
would be vital, and we have candidates."

And you did that.
2
Mr. Phillips.
Yes.
3
Mr. Schwarz.
And then it goes on as follows:
"These
4
officers will perform the delicate shows with great flap
5
6
potential which cannot be done by Station personnel or any
Chilean."
7
8
That is right, isn't it?
Mr. Phillips. That is true.
9
Mr.Schwarz. And by flap potential you meant exposure?
10
Mr. Phillips. Contacting screwballs such as Marshall,
11 that sort of thing.

Mr. Schwarz.
But generally pursuing the Track II

activities?

22
Mr. Phillips. That is right.
Mr. Schwarz. Continuing: "An example. We have can-
didates who can successfully pose as Brazilian intelligence
officers." You did that, didn't you?
Mr. Phillips. Yes.
Mr. Schwarz. And this goes on: "If he approached, funded
and ran a Chilean General, any flap would be a Brazilian one".
Mr. Phillips. Yes.
Mr. Schwarz. So the scheme was that not only would
23
the U.S. not be blamed, but other countries like Brazil would
24
be blamed if something went wrong.
25
Mr. Phillips. Yes, this is particularly sensitive to me,

because my daughter happens to be married to a Brazilian
2
foreign service officer! However, that was it. It was a
3
devious move. It was the final result
the idea being that
4
if such a flap did occur, someone would think it was someone
5
other than the U.S.
The idea of false flag operations is
6
not a new one. The idea I had of going to someone and saying,
7
8
why don't you be a spy for us, I don't work for the Soviets,
is not true.
9
But this is sort of new, the fact that action agents
10
should pose as others.
And yes, it is devious, but that
11
was the idea.
12
Senator Hart of Colorado.
Mr. Phillips, what were
13
14
their instructions if they were to be caught? Were they to go
to their death swearing they were Brazilians or whatever?
15
16
17
18
19
20
Mr. Phillips. I don't think it was quite that dramatic,
Senator. They came to Washington before they went down. And
I briefed them,and I think what I said to them was, this
is going to be a tough and sensitive one, and you don't have
to go if you don't want to, because you culd get in real trouble.
And if you get in trouble, I am not sure we can help
21
you.
22
So, they shrugged their shoulders and went.
23
Mr. Schwarz. Did you tell the Brazilians that you were
24
25
sending someone down to pose as a Brazilian, and his instruc-
tions were that if he were caught he was to continue to pose

as a Brazilian and the Brazilians were approached?
2
Mr. Phillips.
It never occurred to us in our wildest
3
dreams to do that.
4
Mr. Schwarz.
I suppose the relationships between con-
5
tinuing intelligence services were things that were
6
very important to preserve, and that we had very close and
7
delicate relationships with the otherfintelligence services.
8
Mr. Phillips. We do. And if there had been such a
9
man the Brazilians would be quite unhappy with us. But I
10
thought that was better than letting the world know that was
11 a U.S. Citizen down there.
12
Mr. Schwarz. You go on in the cable of September 27
to say this:
"Headquarters believes this false flag was manned by
officers who have repeatedly proved their ability to operate
and recruit under false colors, will give Station great flexi-
bility in handling delicate and fast-moving situations secure-
ly."
13
14
15
16
17
18
19
20
So, the use of false flag persons, at least judging
from this cable, is something repeatedly done by the CIA?
21
22
23
Mr. Phillips. Yes, and by all intelligence services
not all, but all major intelligence services. If you are living
overseas and a man comes up to you and says, hey, I see you
24
are a Marxist, and a man comes up and says, I am from Havana
25
and we would like you to work with the Cuban intelligence

service, he might not be from Havana, he might be from the
2
Soviets, from us, or from the Brazilians.
3
Mr. Schwarz.
So, it is not an unusual practice.
4
Incidentally, you just let drop one thing
5
6
in your testimony a moment ago. You said that in your 25-year
involvement with intelligence matters you had been bothered
7
8
by your activities on only two occasions, one of which was
Chile.
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
And then you said what the other one was. What was that?
Mr. Phillips. I was in Washington attending the Chiefs
of Station course, which is a training course for people who
are going out on their first assignment as Chief of Station.
When President Johnson decided to send 22,000 Marines
to the Dominican Republic, it occurred to me that in order to
protect and evacuate American citizens, that that job might
have been done with 400 Marines. I was scheduled to go there
as the Chief of Station. And I just wasn't sure that I
17
18
wanted to be associated with something like that. But I de-
19
cided, well, I suppose President Johnson knows what he is
20 doing, I will go I am going to go along. So, I did go
21
along.
22
Senator Schweiker.
One question on your differentiation
23
between where you drew a personal commitment line on assassin-
24
ations, but not overthrow. I have trouble quite understanding
25
it, because as I understand Chile, the plot was to overthrow

1
Mr. Phillips.
There is no question that I could under-
2
3
stand why anyone concerned with world affairs, looking at
Chile and what was happening there, would be concerned.
4
Salvadore Allende made his first statement saying that
5
6
he was a Socialist and wanted to change the order some 32
years beforehe was elected.
7
8
Over the years he made it quite clear that he was an ar-
dent socialist.
Before this decision was made I believe that
9
10
11
we had a visit from a man who had the code name of Ariel, he
was a Cuban intelligence officer. The Cubans were moving in
rapidly.
The influence was great. I think that they saw a lot
12
13
14
at stake, another Cuba in Latin America type of thing, the
same thing perhaps that motivated President Johnson to send
22,000 rather than 400.
15
So, I can understand why they
thought this was going,
16
in the long strategic sense, in the
long range against our
17
interests.
But that is an assumption.
18
19
It is true that Allende very definitely made it clear
that he wanted to turn Chile into a Marxist state. The differ-
20
21
22
23
ence was that Allende refused to take Fidel Castro's advice
and use violence. As I understand it, Fidel Castro went to
Chile and said, if you want your revolution to last you are
going to have to use violence.
24
I found it interesting to read in this morning's paper
25 where someone from Portugal came back from Cuba and said,

activities?
Mr. Phillips. No, sir. I was the Station Chief in
3
Rio de Janiero in Brazil, and was called back in 1970 for
4
six or seven weeks for what we are referring to as Track II.
5
6
7
8
Senator Mondale. Now, in that position you familiarized
yourself with the Chilean government, Allende and so on,
and tried to become as expert as you could in the political
forces and so on?
9
Mr. Phillips.
Yes. And in addition to that, Senator,
10
11
one of the reasons I was called back was that I had lived
for many years in Chile, so I knew something about it.
12
Senator Mondale. And it is your judgment as I think I
14
15
16
.17
13 just heard, that although Allende was a Marxist, and espoused
Marxism, he also said he wanted to achieve this through the
democratic process, and although there was some rough stuff
on the press, and so on, essentially that was the course he
was pursuing, is that correct?
18
Mr. Phillips.
I don't recall that he said it, but
19
he indeed acted that way.
20
Senator Mondale. But in fact the course he was pur-
21
suing was an attempt to achieve the Marxist philosophy with
22
the population support under constitutional system?
23
Mr. Phillips.
Yes, essentially that is true, sir.
24
Senator Mondale.
Thank you.

Mr. Schwarz.

6
Mr. Phillips. Senator, it doesn't make any difference
today. On the contrary, since Watergate the people say, why h
should we? Before Watergate it was another ball game.
The President was the Commander in Chief in every sense of the
word.
7
8
And you said, who am I, a GS-15 bureaucrat, to say that
we shouldn't do this? But that has changed since Watergate.
9
Senator Hart of Colorado.
10
One other question.
I call your attention in our briefing books to what is
11
12
13
Tab C, a cable which has your name at the end of it dated 21
September 1970, page 3 of 7. Are you an author or co-author
of that cable?
14
Mr. Phillips. I believe I was the authenticating
15
officer, yes.
16
Senator Hart of Colorado.
What does that mean?
17
Mr. Phillips. That meant that the signature on the
18
right of those cables is someone that is the authenticating
19
20
officer in a sense, here is a fellow that is supposed to know
the situation.
21
22
23
Senator Hart of Colorado. But who wrote it, I guess
is what I am after.
Mr. Phillips. I would guess that this cable was probably
24
written by Mr. Poinzio, and perhaps myself, perhaps it was
25
joint. But Mr. Poinzio wrote an awful lot of them. But by

putting my signature on the authenticating part I said I was

the paragraph identified as the paragraph F contains the follow-

ing sentence or part of a sentence: You suggest sending

What does that mean in Agency talk?
Senator, I want to assure you with real
seriousness that I am not the author of that phrase.
Senator Hart of Colorado. It must have caught your eye,
however.
Mr. Phillips. It did catch my eye. If this was indeed
a joint venture, I can promise that that was Dino Poinzio's
contribution, and if you ever meet him you will understand
why. He was addicted to picturesque speech. And looking
back, all I can say is that it probably went out at four
o'clock in the morning, and we were very tired, and I just
didn't want to argue about that phrase, and I let it go. I
21
22
23
am not sure what it means even now.
24
SEnator Hart of Colorado.
Neither am I. But it seems
25
to describe a lot of what we have heard around here for the

Now, I read that as Helms' position being that the
2
3
4
5
assassination of Schneider was something which presented the
opportunity for the very thing that the U.S. wished to have
done.
Do you agree with me?
6
Mr. Phillips. No, I can't agree with you on that. I am

10.
11
12
13
14
not sure about the suggestion from the language. But I will
tell you the immediate reaction in our little task force when
the word came that Schneider was dead, that is it, it is finished
Knowing Chileans, the moment that that violence occurred,
Chileans, with the possible exception of a nut such as
Marshall, immediately said, this is it, that is enough. There
was still that tradition over the years. And I think that the
moment we heard of it and we discussed it we said, that is
15
it, there will be no more. In many countries in Latin America
16
17
18
that would have been the signal for further action, weakness,
and so forth. But in this case it was the end of the
business.
19
20
Mr. Schwarz. I want to run through with you the activi
ties which were being undertaken with the Valenzuela group
21
and with the Viaux group. In the case of Viaux, was that one
22
23
of the assignments that the false flag officers had?
Mr. Phillips. Yes.
24
Mr. Schwarz. And in the case of Valenzuela, was that
25 one of the assignments that Colonel Wimert had?

Mr. Schwarz. No, the false flag team

Colonel Wimert.

8
Mr. Schwarz. Only in the sense that there might have
9 been some central direction from the office or from headquar-
10 ters. I don't believe that anyone of the false flaggers had
11 the slightest idea that Colonel Wimert was working with us.
12 And I don't believe that Colonel Wimert I don't know that
13 Colonel Wimert knew about them.
14 So, no, they didn't work in tandem, except in sense of
15 direction from the Station.
16 Mr. Schwarz. Headquarters down there, and you in
17 Washington, were working with both the Valenzuela group and
18 the Viaux group?

Viaux group was really acting in order to carry out step one
2
of the Valenzuela group's plan?
3
Mr. Phillips. Yes, to address this point specifically.
4
Obviously when the guns were passed, immediately we
5
and the death occurred so soon after, immediately we
thought they probably used those guns. It was then when we
6
read the press reports that General Schneider died from hand-
7
gun wounds. And that was the first time we thought we could
8
really be sure in our own mind that it wasn't directly
9
the Valenzuela group using those guns.
10
Mr. Schwarz. What about the gas masks that had
11
12
been furnished earlier? Wasn't there evidence that there
were gas masks in the care of the persons who attempted to
13
abduct General Schneider?
14
Mr. Phillips. I don't recall that. That may very well have
15
been, but I am not real sure about.

Mr. Schwarz.
I am going to go to another area, which
17
is the relationship between the two groups.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Concerning the October 19
21
attempts, under Tab 4 on page 7 of the longer memorandum
22
by Dianne Lavoy under October 18 there is reference to a cable
23
A66 dated October 19. And concerning the connection of
24
these various conspirators, it says: "Valenzuela meets with
25
various attache and gives him a 15 point plan for coup to be

writing of the above plan, has promised to keep
3
the Carabineros away from the Schneider houseto assure that the
4
abduction will not be interfered with. General Viaux is
5
knowledgeable of the above operation, but is not directly
6
involved".
7
What do you think "not directly involved" refers to?
8
Why not just not involved?
9
Mr. Phillips. I think that probably referred to what
10
I was saying before, that in these situations it is not very
11
unusual that there is some type talk that everybody has a cousin
12
that works with some group type of thing.
13
And I believe that it must refer to that.
14
Mr. Schwarz. Taking the actual cable, is the actual
15
cable in the Senator's books?
16
Mr. Inderfurther. No.
17
Mr. Schwarz. Let me read the full text of that para-
18
graph from the cable. It is a cable apparently dated 19
19
October on the subject of General Viaux:
20
"General Viaux, knowledgeable of above operation, but not
21
directly involved. He has been sent to Vina to stay with
22
prominent physician. Will be seen in public places during 19
23
and 20 October to demonstrate that above operation is
24
not his doing. Will be allowed to return to Santiago at end of
25
week."

Now, I can't read that language any way other than
2
meaning that the Valenzuela group and the Viaux group were in
3
close cooperation, that was part of the abduction plan, it
4
was agreed between the two that Viaux would appear would
5
be out of town so that he would not appear to be involved.
6
And you have to read that, do you not, as meaning that there
7
was a close cooperation on this effort between the two groups.
8
Mr. Phillips. Yes, I think you do have to read it that
9
way.
10
Miss Culbreth. Would you identify that paper more
11
than just the statement?
12
Mr. Phillips. Cable sent to headquarters A66.
13
Mr. Schwarz. No, A66, eyes only to
14
Mr. Inderfurther. DCOS, which was
15
Mr. Treverton. It is Tab M, it is in the book.
16
Mr. Schwarz. I think we ought to mark that as an ex-
17
hibit.

As for the narrow part of your question, by all means
2
it is a bad way to do business.
3
Senator Schweiker. Go ahead.
4
Mr. Schwarz. Picking up on Senator Schweiker's line
5
of questioning, would you show the witness Tab A, the docu-
6
ment Tab A.
7
It is a memorandum for the record by Mr. Broe dated 17
8
September, and then that is crossed out and it says 16 Sep-
9
tember, "Subject, Genesis of Project".
10
Incidentally, what was the code name for this project?
11
Was it FU Bolero?
12
Mr. Phillips.
Bolero was one of the two.
13
Mr. Schwarz. Does Bolero stand for anything in particular?
14
Mr. Phillips.
It would be FU, the first two
15
letters there indicate a geographical area: FU Chile, FU Bolero
16
lot of different ones, but that would mean Chile. So it would
17
means Chile. Belt means nobody.
18
Mr. Schwarz. Everybody keeps saying that so many of
19
these things mean nothing. Who is responsible for these
20
names?
21
Mr. Phillips. There is somebody who is supposed to
