basis for determining future personnel action. Manger of performance of managwial or supervisory duties must be descrinet, if
applicable. As explained in the previous fitness report, jubject was assigned to the station
for the purpose of taking charge of the Station's joint telephone tap center, a position
for which he was and is eminently qualified by reason of extensive experience and out-
standing language qualifications. However, this position did not materialize because
of circumstances beyond the control of Subject and the Station.
It was therefore subsequently decided to train Subject locally, and have his
gradually assume case officer and analyst responsibilities in certain simpler aspects
of the Station's Soviet program.
Given the circumstances that Subject had not had prior case officer or analyti-
cal experience (or even any substantial past exposure to operations to give him vicari-
ous experience) he progressed more than adequately in absorbing the training offered,
in assuming responsibility for two Soviet operations and in the préparation of analytical
studies on the Soviet complement. Given the further circumstances that the Station did
not have the time to train him more than superficially, and that the operations he
handled were basically uncomplicated, it must be stated that Subject cannot now be
considered to be a case officer..
This conscientious and intelligent officer has high interest and enthusiasm
for operations, but it is believed that his forte and future lies in the management of
technical operations. This has been recognized also by Headquarters in the assignment
presently planned for him.
As a staff agent under tourist cover, he and his family adapted themselves
remarkably well to the deep cover situation and to all other environmental factors.

From the time of Subject's arrival in Mexico and throughall December 1963,
he was utilized principally in translation work and was held on tap the position
of heading up the Station's joint telephone tap center. Circumstances beyond the
control of the Station and Subject are responsible for the fact that the incumbent
in charge_of the center will continue these duties and Subject will be given other
responsibilities.
Primarily, Subject will be trained to handle analyst and case officer
responsibilities in the Soviet field. The level and range of the responsibilities
will depend on the progress Subject makes in handling these duties in a manner
satisfactory to the Station.
Subject is most conscientious and effective in every assignment given him
to date, and the Station is extremely pleased to have him available as an outside
Station asset. He is enthusiastic about all his work, including certain part-time
routine and arduous duties, and he looks forward with confidence to the prospect
of becoming a case officer. Although it is premature to state positively that
Subject will succeed as a case officer, the supervisor believes that Subject will
undoubtedly progrèss adequately.
Subject and his family have acclimated themselves excellently to the deep
cover situation, faster than most of the Station's other staff agents, and certainly
with fewer problems and requcats for guidance from the Station's staff.
