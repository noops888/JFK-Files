2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
24 OCT 1975
MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence
SUBJECT:
REFERENCE:
Supplementary Information on James Earl Ray
DDO Memorandum for DCI dated 23 October 1975
Subject: Background for Rather Interview
James Earl Ray
Dick Ober (then in CI) who wrote all the early Ray cables,
recalls that he had numerous discussions with the FBI on the
matter, and is certain that whatever we did was undertaken at
the request of the FBI. Because of the fast moving situation,
most of his discussions with the FBI were on the phone, and
not the subject of written memoranda. The paper clipped
outgoing cable in referring to Eric Galt (the man initially
identified by the FBI as the assassin of Dr. King) requests
"addressees make every effort determine if Galt is or has
been in your area. Information para one should be passed
to liaison and any other likely sources. FBI requests that
any information reported be evaluated as to reliability and
that as much detail as possible be provided. Cable any
positive reply priority to HQS. and pass to legal attache
if any in your country." There is a scribbled note in the
file, presumably in Ober's hand, which reads: "4. Ray
fingerprints: FBI agreed to my proposal we send to field
for liaison." Ober, also logically points out that the FBI
would not have provided us later with a fingerprint formula
(see attached cable), a detailed physical description and
photos unless they wanted this passed on to overseas liaison
services. (Note that our cables did not go, for example, to
Ottawa or Mexico City?)
