II. ACTIONS PENDING: The major pending action is the establishment
of a penetration and/or friendships within the (PRI) once the situ-
ation in (PRI headquarters) has solidified to some degree. For ex-
ample/Lic/Juan MALDONADO) ALDONADO sits this date,
neither out of his job, nor confirmed in a job. However, it would
appear that the LIMIX mechanism has at least five channels into
the new PRI national executive staff which are being developed
for appropriate utilization. A separate report will be prepared
on these channels into the PRI national. Other channels exist to
provide contacts within the PRI Regional headquarters for Mexico
City, but nothing can be done until current officers are retired

intelligence gathering and political action in this field.
