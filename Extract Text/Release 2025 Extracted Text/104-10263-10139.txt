SMOTH appreciated the KGB document forwarded with
Reference and have submitted the following comments and
questions:
1. "We have a number of questions about this document
on which we should be grateful for your comments, and as
background to some of these we think it will be useful for
you tohave an account of WYNNE-ELLIS) dealings with AELADLE:
06
a. "They date from June 1961 when he was con-
sidering a visit to the U.S.S.R. He mentioned this to the
Soviet Ambassador, whom he met at the Queen's Erthday
Celebration in Helsinki, (he did not realise at first that
it was the Ambassador to whom he was talking). The Ambassador
suggested that he should get in touch with Ivan Efimovich
SERGEEV, an identified R.I.S. officer.
06
b. "Between 5th and 15th July 1961 (WYNNE-E
went to the Consular Section of the Soviet Embassy to see
about the visa. Apparently he did not see SERGEEV but met
AELADLE who showed a good deal of curiosity about him and
asked whether he had ever been to the U.S.S.R. before,
whether he had applied in London for a visa, what he was
doing in Helsinki etc. The possibility of ABLADLE taking
English lessons from WYNNE-ELLIS was mentioned and AELADLE
said he would get in touch with WYNNE-ELLIS About this. He
asked for a short biogrphy of WYNNE-ELLIS)
(WYNNE-ELLIS)
:

"He brought the visa application forms and his
biography to AELADLE two days later and although AELADLE was
apparently very busy he asked WYNNE-ELLIS) for clarification
of various details AELADLE did not take English lessons
from (WYNNE-ELLIS)06
d. At the end of September, or beginning of
asking for the address of his pen friend in Russia, Stanislav
GALKIN, who had been concerned in (WYNNE-ELLIS,% recruitment
by the R.I.S (WYNNE-ELLIS) telephoned AELADLE to say that
he did not have the new address. AELADLE told him that if
he wanted it, he could have a visa 'tomorrow' to visit
Stalingrad (now Volgograd) and in the course of conversation
said sometimes it is better to visit places but not old
friends'. We wondered at the time, and ever more after
AELADLE's defection, whether this remark had any special
significance.
116201 October 1961, WYNNE-ELLIS) received a letter from AELADLE
..
06
"On 16th November AELADLE invited (WYNNE-ELLIS)
to attend a Soviet concert. AELADLE told him that he had
been granted a tourist visa but that if he wished to visit
his pen friend he would require a letter of invitation from
him. AFLADLE asked about is British friends in Helsinki and
said that he would phone WYNNE-ELLIS next week to make a
further appointment. He did not do this,

"A further development which may be of interest
is that in early January 1952 (WYNNE-ELLIS) received a further
letter from his hussian pen friend giving him a fairly
preasing invitation to visit him. FYNNE-ELLIS, who was not
aware of AELADLE'& defection, wrote to AELADLE telling him
that he had now receiven the invitation, and inviting him
to coffee at his house!
06
2. "We thought that the arrival of this letter (it
was dated 25.12.61) so shortly after AELADLE's defection,
and after a long gap in the correspondence between (WYNNE-ELLIS)
and his pen friend, might indicate that the R.I.S. suspected
that WYNNE-ELLIS had had a hand in AELADLE's defection.
WYNNE-ELLIS) was never aware that AELADLE was an R.I.S. officer.
3. of As you know from an earlier conversation about
this case (WYNNE-ELLIS) is a most unsatisfactory character
to deal with, and we believe that the R.I.S. have found him
Lequally unsatisfactory! We have no reason to suppose that
24 (he has double-crossed us since he was turned, but we would
not exclude this as a possibility or at least would not
exolude the possibility that he might have considered this.
4. "Our questions on the WYNNE-ELLIS) document supplied
by AELADLE are as follows:
۵.
"What is the manuscript word at the top of the
first page, and what is its significance?
b. "The two typed words, one immediately below
the manuscript word on page 1 and the other to the left, are
not legible on our copy.
0.
"Is there any significance in the date 11th
November being in inverted commas, thus "11"?
d. "We are puzzled by what at first sight appeared
to be a date, 22.XII.1961, in the heading immediately above
the text on page 1. In fact the Roman numerals Xii are
the cyrillic letter XT, but we do not understand their
meaning. Can AELADLE explain this?
e. "What is the name in which the document is
signed, and does AELADLE know the true identity of this person?
f. "We are a little surprised at the cyrillic trans-
literation of WYNNE-ELLIS's name. We should have expected the
KGB to have a system which would enable them to get back to
the correct English spelling. Admittedly WYNNE-ELLIS's name
is an awkward one to deal with.
06
g. "We should have expected that AELADLE would have
Bent a trace request to his Headquarters shortly after the
first meeting with WYNNE-ELLIS) in July 1961. Yet the reply
was apparently sent only on 11th November. Can AELADLE
comment on this?
७७
5. "We do not wish to suggest by these comments that
we suspect that this document might be a forgery, but we
would be grateful for your confirmation that you do not
consider this a possibility.

6. "You will no doubt in due course be questioning06
AELADLE in detail on his knowledge of the WYNNE-ELLIS) care.
We do not at this stage wish to suggest detailed questions
except to remark that we do not know the real names of any
of the R.I.S. officers who dealt with him including the
man whom, it is stated in the AELADLE document, he met in
the U.K. There is some mystery about this because (WYANE-00 WYNE-06
ELLIS denies having met any R.I.S. officer in the U.K..
he did however have contact with various Russians here
(including an R.I.S. officer) and we suspect that the
R.I.S. officer never identified himself as such to WYANE-06
