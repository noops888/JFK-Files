1. Reference is made to the last form regarding Subject
who entered the United States on 6 October 1964. The files of
this office contain the following pertinent information.
2. According to another office of this Agency, a Pan
American Airways employee who spends considerable time in
Haiti stated that during his many trips there he learned Subject
had demanded and received things from members of the
Ton Ton Macoutes (TTM, President DUVALIER's Internal
Security Force). One incident occurred at a DUVALIER family
ball at the Presidential Palace on 1 May 1964. A palace guard
refused to allow Subject to leave the grounds while someone was
speaking. SAUREL called a member of the TTM, demanded to be
released, and was allowed to leave. On 20 September 1964, a
source of unknown reliability, whose family was well ac-
quainted with Subject, commented that Subject was a member
of the TTM.
3. According to a report received in September 1964
from an untested source, Subject, a former employee of Pan
American Airways in Port-au-Prince who was recently named
Director of the Haitian Tourist Bureau in New York, is an
agent of President DUVALIER. DUVALIER is cultivating heavily
SAUREL because of the latter's experience in dealing with
American personalities and situations. CS COPY FEED 100-2-82

Airways employee who spends considerable time in Haiti
advised another office of this Agency she attended a cocktail
party in Port-au-Prince in late November 1963. Other guests

he had a $300 thousand contract with the Haitian
Government to explore the country's natural
