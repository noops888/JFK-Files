2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
29 August 1962
MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Summary of S/W Training and Issuance of Materials.
AGENT: AMLASH/1
PLACE : Paris, France
DATE : 17-22 August 1962
TRAINER: Richard M. Fallucci, TPE C/O.
1. AMLASH/1 was instructed in S/W techniques by the under-
signed in a Paris Station safehouse on 17 and 18 August, and was
given an S/d review in the final briefing session held in the hotel
room of Wallace A. Growery (Madrid Station C/O) on 22 August.
Instruction was given in the use of carbon writing system No. 15136
and in the use of liquid developer system No. 56638. The "scorch"
method of development was also demonstrated to A/l as an alternate
system. A total of five hours was devoted to this instruction.
2. 4/1, who was recruited a short time prior to coming to
Paris, was introduced to the idea of using S/W by the undersigned
during discussions held in Copenhagen. Although for security
considerations, he was skeptical at first about using such a means
of communication, he was without undue effort convinced that any
productive relationship depended upon his being able to communicate
with his C/O on a regular basis through the medium of S/N letters
sent through normal mail channels. It was apparent from his early
questions that he was unfamiliar with the principles of S/W and clandes-
tine communications in general. After further talks in Paris with
Growery on 16 Angust, A/1 was fully prepared to accept the concept
of S/W communications, and arrangements were made for this instruction
to begin the following day.
3. The first training session on 17 August lasted a little
more than two hours, and was devoted to an explanation of the S/a
system of communication, including careful instruction in the
preparation of a letter containing S/W. A/1 also prepared an S/
letter of his own under the supervision of the undersigned. He
seemed to grasp readily the principles of the preparation of an S/W
message and experienced only a little difficulty at first in remember-
ing all the steps in sequence necessary for the preparation of an S/W
message. He was generally attentive to the instruction given. How-
ever, in keeping with his temperment, he was a little impatient
during the preparation of the S/W message itself upon the cover
letter. At the end of this session, he demonstrated that he remembered
the basic steps in a satisfactory manner, particularly considering
that it was his first day in S/W instruction.
4. The second period of instruction took place in the same
safehouse, lasting about two hours. This session was devoted to a
review of the S/N procedures and the preparation by A/l of another
practice S/W letter. Following this, A/1 was instructed in the
development of S/W messages, using the liquid developer No. 56638
The scorch system of development was also demonstrated. A/1 was
impressed by the simplicity of the liquid developer and the immediate
reaction which it produced. The undersigned developed one message;
then 4/1 was allowed to prepare the developer from its dry pill form
and to develop a second practice S/W message for himself. Following
the period devoted to S/W development, a general review of S/W
communications was held, the basic points apparently being well-fixed
in A/1's mind.
5. During the final formal meeting with A/1 on 22 August
with Growery and the undersigned participating, the latter gave A/1
a general review of all the S/A procedures
which were to be used
in his contact with KUBARK. He also was provided with the following
items:
A. Two sheets of S/W carbon paper (No. 15136)
B. Forty-seven pills of developer ( No. 56638)
C. One tablet of writing paper provided by TSD and
known to be compatible with the carbon sheets.
D. 3 No. 2 pencils of French manufacture.
E. One ball-point pen with water-resistant ink.
F. Two accomodation addresses: one in Madrid for
regular contact; one in New York City for rapid
emergency contact (see attached S/W data sheet).
G. Appropriate indicators (see S/W data sheet)
It is noted that A/1 did not have a secure accomodation address in
PBRUMEN to give us at this time. He was told, however, that it was
imperative that he provide one for us by S/W letter within two weeks
of his return to PBRUMEN. This he stated he would do.
6. During the last S/W review, A/1 was shown a photograph
of one of his practice messages which he had prepared. He was quite
interested in seeing this, which served to illustrate a number of the
training points which had been covered during previous instruction.

SECRET
Generally, A/1 was an interested pupil and it is believed that he
will be able to carry out the instructions in a proper manner.
He
is quite security conscious, a factor which it is believed, will add
to his attempts to seek perfection in his S/W correspondence and
in the secure storage of his S/W materials when not in use.
It is
also known that A/1 practiced his S/W techniques in his hotel room
after leaving the 22 August meeting. This is known because he had
an additional question to ask us at a brief meeting on 23 August.
7. It should also be noted that the TSD technician who
developed A/l's practice letters recommends that for best results,
all letters from A/1 be subjected to ammonia fuming before immersion
in the developer.
