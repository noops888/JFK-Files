COMMENT", Dec 75 issue
(alumni..magazine of
Simon Fraser University
in British Colombia.)
Dr. Halperin
Fortune, or chance, has played a major role in Simon Fraser
Political Science professor Dr. Maurice Halpern's nearly
seventy years.
It was chance that compelled him to seek employment
with Boston University and the University of Mexico. It was chance
that led him to a teaching stint in Cuba. And it was chance
that brought him to Simon Fraser seven years ago.
In fact, fortune began wielding its capricious influence over
his life even before Dr. Halperin was born.
"I might have been born in Canada," he says. "My father
sailed from Liverpool to the New World at the turn of the cen-
tury, with Montreal as his destination. However, he decided
to move to Boston."
This was a rather fortunate circumstance over which I had
no control," since Montreal at the time was still a provincial
city while Boston was "a metropolis, a great centre of culture
and learning and all its splendid facilities were available to
me."
Among those facilities which he made use of were the
Boston Latin School- a secondary school which boasts
such luminaries as Benjamin Franklin and Ralph Waldo Emer-
son among its alumni - and Harvard University.
He completed his post-graduate work in Paris at the Sor-
bonne which, at that time, was one of the most prestigious university
in the world and "the impact it had on my way of life and
thinking was a permanent one."
While attending the Sorbonne, Dame Fortune stepped in
and "I was appointed to the faculty as a Reader in North
American Civilization. Even though I came from Harvard, the
level of competence and sophistication of the French stu-
dents was much higher and I had to work very hard to keep
up with them."
After completing his doctorate, Dr. Halperin joined the
faculty at the University of Oklahoma and found that mid-
western state to be "like another country. Boston and Paris
were much closely related than were Boston and Oklahoma."
However, chance intervened to rescue him from what
could have been a number of indifferent years in a then small
and remote university on the American Prairies, turning them
into years spent in "an oasis of high culture."
Dr. Halperin explains:
"It was during the Depression and jobs were scarce, so
the university attracted a number of bright teachers and
researchers whose first choice might not have been Okla-
homa.
"And when you have a group of people like that, in addition
to the opportunity of increasing one's knowledge and learning to appreciate
the virtues of mid-America, well, it was something that
stayed with me for the rest of my life."
The Second World War interrupted Dr. Halperin's sojourn
at the University of Oklahoma and he joined the Office of
Maurice Halperin, Simon Fraser's oldest professor, is a
keen musician who has played with the New Westminster
Symphony Orchestra.
Strategic Services, a special research and intelligence
agency attached to the Joint Chiefs of Staff:
"I had a front row seat in the planning of some of the most
interesting operations of the war," he says. "I consider my
experiences there were at least the equivalent of a second
PhD because I was associated with a whole group of social
scientists in different disciplines.
"Through this, I had the realization that we had practical
matters to consider in the social sciences, as well as theo-
retical ones. And I learned the value of cooperative effort,
the value of getting work done on time, and the value of
efficiency in research.
"It helped me to see the relationship between the social
sciences and practical problems. I became more oriented
toward problem solving than I had been before."

Dame Fortune keeps popping up
in life of SFU's oldest professor
and has taken him to Mexico, Cuba,

After the war, Dr. Halperin worked with the United Nations
for a couple of years and then joined the faculty of Boston
University where he was involved in the establishment of an
interdisciplinary department of Latin American studies.
During this period he visited Brazil twice, lecturing at the
University of Sao Paulo and serving as a consultant to the
state government of Sao Paulo. After his second visit, he was
decorated by the Brazilian government with the Order of the
Southern Cross.
It was then that chance interfered again, this time in a most
malicious way.
"My stay at Boston coincided with the most intense period
of McCarthyism and this raised problems for a great number
of people at the time. In my own case, I was given the choice
of cooperating with the inquisition or, as it turned out, losing
my job.
"Among other disagreeable aspects of cooperating, it
would have turned me into an informer against people who,
as far as I know, had committed no crime. I just couldn't think
of facing my students with their knowledge that I was an
informer."
Leaving Boston University, he went to the National Uni-
versity of Mexico City where he remained for six years. While
working there, he did some consulting work for the Mexican
Government, thereby gaining further practical experience
on the problems of underdevelopment in Latin America.
This experience led directly to his next position - a three-
year appointment at the Academy of Sciences in Moscow.
Halperin explains:
"At that time, the period when Khrushchev was trying to
loosen up some of the rigid controls of Stalin's dictatorship,
there was a desire at the Academy to have some western
expertise on Latin American developmental problems. In
other words, my Mexican experience was a direct prerequisite
for the Moscow invitation.
"It's strange how, in retrospect, what seemed to be a
rather difficult choice in 1953 turned out to be very lucky.
You never know. Something happens that can crush you or,
on the contrary, can make you healthier and more robust
than you've ever been before.
"And, when the invitation came from Moscow, I was foot-
loose and free. My status in Mexico was always that of a
visiting professor, so I had no problems of security - tenure
or pension, for example - to tie me to town. When it came, I
had nothing to lose and everything to gain."
Dr. Halperin spent three years at the Academy and found
it to be an extraordinary experience. "I wasn't there as a
tourist; neither was I there as an outside researcher. I was
actually in the machine, with no permanent ties to it. I was
working in the factory, rather than just studying it."
Fate once again intervened in his life, this time in the form
of the celebrated Latin American guerrilla leader, Che
Guevara.
"Late one night, there was a knock on my door and I
opened it and there stood Che with a couple of his Cuban
friends. He had been told about me by mutual friends in
Mexico and they suggested that, in view of the need for
competent educators and social scientists in Cuba, I might
be interested in accepting an invitation to teach at the Uni-
versity of Havana."
As it happened, Dr. Halperin was interested. He spent the
next six years in Cuba, and after leaving, produced a book
on the country - The Rise and Decline of Fidel Castro: An
Essay in Contemporary History. It was published by the Uni-
versity of California Press and a second edition, in paper-
back, has recently appeared. (Incidentally, Dr. Halperin's
published work spans 45 years and "several thousand
pages.")
As with the Moscow appointment, it was the fact that he
was freed of concerns about job security, since he had none,
which allowed him to accept Guevara's offer.
Although Cuba was "a very pleasant country," Dr. Hal-
perin found life there to be somewhat disconcerting since,
"as a highly-paid foreign expert, I lived high off the hog and
didn't share the austerity of the rest of the country.
"And it was troubling, you know, when neighbors would
knock on our door to see if we
