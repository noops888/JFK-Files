1. A trace reply prepared for the FBI in November 1976
indicated that from 1956 until 1961 LEONOV was in Moscow during
which time he was reported to have attended the KGB school
from 1958 until 1960. From 1960 until 1961 LEONOV was at
the Fifth Department of KGB Hqs. A statement was also included
which said that during his tours in Mexico LEONOV was consistently
active in clandestine support of Latin American revolutionary
and subversive activities, particularly relating to Guatemala.
PDSTORAGE: As of 1976 LEONOV was Chief of Service No. 1
(Information) of KGB Headquarters First (Foreign Intelligence)
Directorate in Moscow. LEONOV has been considered for at least
two Ambassadorial posts.
A statement that a reliable defector had identified LEONOV as
a KGB officer was transmitted to the State Department in August 1966
(NOTE: DERY BIN's iden in September 1964 was inconclusive but
could have been misinterpreted.)

BIOGRAPHIC PROFILE
OF
NIKOLAY SERGEYEVICH LEONOV
1. Nikolay Sergeyevich LEONOV was born on 22 August 1928
in Almazovo, USSR (also reported as Ryazan, USSR.) LEONOV
graduated at an unknown date from the institute of Foreign
Relations in Moscow. He was assigned as Interpreter and
Secretary to the ambassador at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
City from May 1953 until 17 October 1956. On 31 July 1961
LEONOV returned to Mexico City as Third Secretary and Assistant
Cultural Officer. He served in this capacity until his PCS
departure in June 1964. LEONOV and his family went on home
leave to the USSR from 21 April to 20 July 1963, During this
leave LEONOV served as Fidel CASTRO's interpreter in the USSR
in May 1963. LEONOV was assigned to Mexico City again on
10 October 1964 as Second Secretary and Press Attache at the
Soviet Embassy. He departed PCS for the USSR on 22 December 1968.
From April to July 1969 LEONOV served temporarily as representative
of the Soviet News Agency "NOVOSTI" in Lima, Peru.
2. Additional travel information reflects that LEONOV
served as interpreter for Soviet Vice Premier Anastas MIKOYAN
on his trips to Mexico and Cuba in November 1959 and again in
February 1960 when the Soviet Cultural and Technical Exposition
was being held. LEONOV traveled to the Dutch West Indies and
Trinidad in September 1962; his position and purpose of his
SECRET

trip are unknown. LEONOV was a delegate to the 31st Session
of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City from
19 September to 10 October 1976. In late June 1977 LEONOV
accompanied two other Soviet officials on a visit to Panama
where they were scheduled to visit with Panamarian Government
officials. The next day LEONOV traveled to Bogota, Colombia
where he remained until 3 July 1977. On this date he
departed for Frankfurt, West Germany, presumably enroute
home to the USSR.
3. LEONOV and his wife, Valeriya Ivanovich, who was
born 30 April 1923 in Ryazan, have a daughter, Irina
Nikolayevna, who was born on 16 March 1962 in Mexico City.
LEONOV reportedly speaks excellent Spanish, good English, some
French and little German. He has been described as pleasant,
outgoing, intelligent, shrewd, conscientious, and reliable.
He has a sense of humor but displays a temper at times.
4. Based on his activities and associations in Mexico
City during his tours of duty between May 1953 and
December 1968 LEONOV is considered to be a staff officer of
the KGB (Soviet Committee for State Security.)

1. UPON FURTHER REVIFA OF FILE ON BERNARDO LEMUS
MENDOZA (201-0091575) FOR CLEARANCE PURPOSES, ONE DOCUMENT WHICH
MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO STATION INDICATES THAT LEMUS WAS IN
CONTACT WITH A KGR OFFICER WHILE IN MEXICO. ACCORDING TO
MGGN-4035 DATED 2 DEC 60, INFORMATION TAKEN FROM CAPTURED PGT
DOCUMENTS REVEALED THAT LEMUS, WHILE IN EXILE IN MEXICO FROM 1953-56,
WAS A CLOSE PERSONAL FRIEND OF KNOWN KGR OFFICER NIKOLAY
SERGEYEVICH LEONOV (201-0132139).
2. LEONOV WAS BORN 22 AUG 28 IN USSR. HE SERVED IN MEXICO
FROM 1953-56 AS INTERPRETER/SECRETARY TO THE SOVIET AMBASSADOR.
(FYI: PER POSTORAGE FROM 56-61 HE ATTENDED KGB SCHOOL AND SERVED
AT KGB HQS.) DURING 1961-64 LEONOV WAS THIRD SECRETARY, ASSISTANT
CULTURAL OFFICER AT SOVIET EMBASSY, AND FROM 64-68 HE WAS
SECOND SECRETARY AND PRESS ATTACHE. DURING HIS TOURS IN MEXICO,
LEONOV WAS REPORTEDLY CONSISTENTLY ACTIVE IN THE SUPPORT OF
LATIN AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY AND SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES, PARTICULARLY
THOSE RELATED TO GUATEMALA. LAST KNOWN LOCATION OF LEONOV WAS
TRIP TO BOGOTA FROM 27 JUNE TO 3 JULY 1977.
3. FROM ABOVE DATA IT WOULD SEEM THAT LEMUS KNEW LEONOV
PRIOR TO LEONOV'S KGB TRAINING.
