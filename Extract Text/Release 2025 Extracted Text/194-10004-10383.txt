(EMPLOYMENT CO-WORKER) On 24 September 1968, Albert B. Cassidy
Jr., Personnel Director, Mutual Insurance Advisory Association, 733 3rd
Avenue, New York, New York 10017, who resides at 2939 Route number 2,
Browns Mills, New Jersey 08015, was interviewed at his place of employ-
ment concerning Manuel MARTI. Source, who was associated with MARTI as
a co-worker at Mutual Insurance Advisory Association from April 1965 to
May 1968, stated substantially as follows:
اگر
Source first met SUBJECT in April 1965, when he interviewed MARTI
for employment at Mutual Insurance Advisory Association, and maintained
daily business contact with SUBJECT throughout HIS period of employment
with the aforementioned organization. Source had no social contact
with SUBJECT, and last saw MARTI in May 1968 when HE departed the organi-
zation on military leave.
SUBJECT was employed at Mutual Insurance Advisory Association
from 5 April 1965 to 20 May 1968. HE was originally hired as a Utility
Clerk. HE was subsequently promoted to Utility Clerk Supervisor and later
to Tabulating Machine Operator. MARTI enjoyed an excellent reputation
among HIS associates at HIS place of employment and everyone was sorry to
see HIM leave. Source would be happy to re-employ SUBJECT upon termination
of HIS military service.
SUBJECT was single and resided with HIS parents in Bronx, New York,
further details unknown. SUBJECT'S mother, name unknown, died in late
1966 or early 1967. MARTI is a high school graduate, and HE worked for
Polly Perry Stores, New York, New York, prior to HIS employment at Mutual
Insurance Advisory Association. Source has no further knowledge concerning
SUBJECT'S personal background, but believed that SUBJECT was of Puerto
Rican decent.
42
SUBJECT is of excellent character, integrity, discretion and morals.
HE is financially responsible, and had no known difficulty with law enforce-
ment agencies during the period of association. SUBJECT manifested no un-
desirable personal habits, nor any sign of immaturity or emotional instability.
Source had no knowledge concerning the degree of influence exerted on SUBJECT
by HIS parents. MARTI was never heard to express any radical political
views, and Source considers HIM to be pro-democratic in HIS political views
and loyal to the United States. SUBJECT has no known organizational
affiliations, and Source had no knowledge concerning HIS foreign travels,
foreign interests or relatives residing abroad.
Cassidy highly recommends that MARTI be favorably considered for
a position of trust and responsibility with the United States Government.
