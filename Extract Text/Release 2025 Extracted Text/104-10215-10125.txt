Daniel M. O'Connell, a member of the American youth group which
toured Communist China after attending the Moscow Youth Festival, arrived
in Hong Kong on 6 October 1957. O'Connell provided the Consulate General,
Hong Kong, with information on some of the other members of the group.
He had the following to say about Louis Alhonote:
"Louis ALHONOTE, from Brooklyn, was mentally ill and had been told
by a doctor that he was paranoic. Once in a meeting of the American group
when one of the other members disagreed with him, he dashed a glass cup
against the wall. On a second such occasion, he threw a glass cup at
Jake ROSEN, which caused Rosen to have three stitches in his chin and five
in his biceps.. This second incident was hushed up only with difficulty because
the Chinese authorities learned of it when a doctor was called."
