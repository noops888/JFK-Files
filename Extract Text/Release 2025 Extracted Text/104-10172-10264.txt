1. On 13 June 1973 at 1100 hours a meeting attended
by Mr. Jack Shaffer and Mr. Ernest Weidul, CDC; Mr. Jack
Friedlander, SB; Mr. Negoy and Mr. Radulovich, DCS; Dr. Jerry
Post, Psychiatric Staff and Mr. Tsikerdanos of the CI Staff
was held at the CDC offices to discuss and decide which of
those defectors for whom we have a legal responsibility should
be watched during the BREZHNEV visit.
2. The Psychiatric Staff, SB and CDC had prepared
lists of those defectors and others whom they felt were un-
predictable, unstable and/or violent. The following are the
names of those submitted (including comments made and the
agreed on position the Agency would take):
01
A. Antanas SUTKUS (AEMIGALE) was the
only defector listed by the KGB on their
watch list. BUTKUS works for the RFE in
Alexandria. He is noted as being non-violent
and not likely to cause trouble. His wife
who is studying to be a medical assistant
is bitter towards the Soviets but also un-
likely to cause trouble. He is a publicized
defector. It was decided to pass his name
routinely to the Secret Service.
01
10
B. ZAVOROSKIY AEGOLD) who is in Seattle.
He is the former sea Captain who is a heavy
drinker. He does not want to go to jail and
therefore is likely to avoid trouble. It was
decided to pass his name to the Secret Service.

Indiana, He is also a drunk and a passer of
bad checks. He is often in trouble. CA Staff
apparently with the retirement of Jameson has 03
no contact. When TROFIMOV is drunk he calls
the Soviets at the UN Mission and talks of re-
defection. He may possibly be in New York now
living with two homosexual friends. Notify the
Secret Service.

that AEGAIN was being checked by the police in

nut who aspires to the Romanoff crown. Notify

Osborne and Dr. Charles Bohrer both agreed that

tached). Both Mr. Friedlander and I sharply
disagreed with this viewpoint. Mr. Shaffer 03
requested that I check it out with Mr. Angleton.

1. Dr. Charles Bohrer recommends (subject to Howard
Osborne's concurrence) that the twe sellewing defectors
be added to the Brezhnev visit watch list:
a, Anatoliy GOLITZYN (AELADLE). Delusions of
grandeur; expected much more from the U.S. Government than
he in fact received in terms of perscaal recognition.
trated, reclusive. May take some actica to "get even."
Frus-
b. Yuri NOSSENKO (AEDONOR). Not seriously neurotic,
but because of the way in which he was handled he has reason
to be vengeful, and may take the Brezhner visit as an oppor-
tunity to embarrass us.

.
1. Howard Osborn's recommendations for the Brezhnev
"watch list":
a. Delete NOSSENKO. He's happily rehabilitated,
well disposed toward CIA and the USG, well adjusted. Not
a threat.
b. GOLENIEWSKI. Absolutely nutty. Put him at
the top of the list. He hates the Soviet Government because
it's depriving him of the Romanov crown jewels.
c. Anatoliy GOLITZYN. Agree with Bohrer. Put
him on the list.
