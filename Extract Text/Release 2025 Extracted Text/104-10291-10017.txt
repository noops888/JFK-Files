SUBJ, DCD CASE 65805 - BRUCE BERKMANS
REF:
MAINWARING/FRENCH TELECON OF 9 SEPTEMBER 1976, SAME SUBJECT
1. FOR THE RECORD, THE PRIMARY PURPOSE FOR BRUCE BERKMANS
REQUEST THAT I SEE HIM WAS TO ENABLE HIM TO REFER A POSSIBLE
APPLICANT FOR STAFF EMPLOYMENT TO THE AGENCY. I WILL INFORMALLY
RAISE THIS MATTER WITH THE PERSONNEL RECRUITER WHEN HE IS REXT
IN THE MIAMI FIELD OFFICE. BERKMANS HAD NO PERSONAL INTEREST
IN THIS MATTER AND WAS SIMPLY TRYING TO PLAY THE ROLLE OF A HELPFUL
INDIVIDUAL.
2. HE ALSO REVIEWED SOME PROJECTS THAT HIS ORGNIZATION WILL
BE INVOLVED IN BOTH LATIN AMERICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST. AS OF
THIS DATE IT IS TO EARLY TO DETERMINE WHETHER WE MIGHT HAVE ANY
INTEREST IN THESE MATTERS. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE NO REPORTABLE INTEL
OR OPERATIONAL MATERIALS.
3. BERKMANS ALSO DISCUSSED HIS COMPANY'S APPROACH TO EXECUTIVE
PROTECTION AGAINST THE THREAT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. THIS
MAY BE STILL ANOTHER AREA IN WHICH HE MIGHT OCCASIONALLY VOLUNTEER
A USEFUL ITEM.
4. AS NOTED EARLIER, SINCE HIS DECISION TO REFRAIN FROM ANY
LITIGATION INVOLVING THE AGENCY, HE SEEMS TOTALLY RELAXED MY
PERSONAL APPRAISAL NOW IS THAT HE WILL POSE NO PROBLEMS FOR US
IN THE FUTURE DESPITE THE UNPLEASANTNESS OF A FEW YEARS AGO.

I MET AGAIN ON 2 JULY 1976 VITA BRUCE BERKMANS, IMMEDIATELY
HE REITERATED WHAT HE HAD ALREADY TOLD FE OF THE TELEPHONE:
AFTER CONSULTATIONS WITH HIS ATTORNEY AND CONSIDERABI E REFLECTION
HE HAS DECIDED THAT HE WILL NOT SUE THE AGENCY OR ANY STAFFERS:
OR FORMER STAFFERS. HE ATTRIBUTES THIS DECISION TO WHAT HE ১
CALLED THE INORDINATE COSTS IN BOTH TIME LED MONEY. HE ALSO
VOLUNTEERED HIS FEELING THAT THE AGEBOT DES BEING KICKED FROM
EVERY SIDE AND HE DID NOT WISH TO ADD TO THE PROBLEM.

2. BERKMANS WAS CONSIDERABLY MORE COMPOSED AND RELAXED AT
THIS SECOND MEET ING ALMOST AS IF HE WERE RELIEVED AT FINALLY HAVING
COME TO A DECISION. HE THEN REPEATED WAT APPEARS NOW TO BE A
SINCERE OFFER TO ACT ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS AND IN A NONOPERATIONAL
CAPACITY AS A NORMAL DCD CONTACT. HE PENTIONED VOLUNTARILY THAT
HE HAD SOUGHT AND OBTAINED THE CONSENT OF HIS BOSS GEORGE
WACKENHUI IN THIS RESPECT.
:
3. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT BERKMANS IS INVOLVED IN VARIOUS
FOREIGN PROJECTS WHICH COULD BE OF INFORMATIONAL INTEREST TO US.
I WAS, NONETHELESS, DELIBERATELY VAGLE AND NONCOMMITTAL WITH
REGARD TO HIS OFFER. I AM, HOWEVER, LESS WARY OF SOME SORT OF
RELATIONSHIP HAN I MIGHT HAVE BEEN BASED PURELY ON OUR FIRST
INTERVIEW. IN ANY EVENT THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT WE WILL HEAR

: Contact with Former Staff Agent
1. This will confirm our green line telephone
conversation of 22 June 1976 concerning a recommendation
that DCD contact Mr. Bruce Berckmans Jr., (201-309117),
a former staff agent under the LPGLOBE program. Mr.
Berckans recently telephoned an Agency staff officer with
whom he is acquainted, indicating that he had information
of interest and needed to talk with some one from the
Agency. Mr. Berekmans is currently employed by the
Wackenhut Corporation in the Miami area.
2. We discussed this case with Mr. Anthony Goldin,
Assistant General Counsel/DDO, who felt that a representa
tive of the Agency should meet with Mr. Berckmans to sée
what he had on his mind. Mr. Goldin said we would not
be in violation of any Agency regulations or guidelines
since Mr. Berckmans was the one requesting the meeting.
Mr. Goldin recommended that contact be made through ăn
overt employée (DCD) rather than through the LA/Miami
Station.
3. Upon learning of your two immediate intel reports
on 22 June, from private investigator sources, concerning
plans for possible assassination of Caribbean leaders, we
felt there may be a connection between these reports and
Mr. Berckmans' information. It is for that reason that
we suggested that DCD might want to, move rapidly on this
matter.
4. As mentioned on the green line, Mr. Berckmans
address is 3941 Midway St., Miami, Florida; his telephone
number is (area code 305) 443-2260.
