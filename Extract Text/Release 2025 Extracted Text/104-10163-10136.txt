close to each other that we referred to them as the Gold Dust wins."
Ramon was in the shipping business in Zavara and eventually had to

6. Ferpert L. Barker. AMCLATTER-1. Wife: Clara. Barker is a
Cuban-American. Ex-Cantata in the U.S.A.F. See PKQ and 201 for fuil
bio data. I recruited barker in 1959, end he served faithfully stil
we had to exfiltrate hir sometice in 1960. He recruited a mnber of
valuable agents for the Station (including AMCLATTER-5, which see) and
bed an amazing encyclopedic knowledge of Cuban persons, events and con-
tacts in all walks of life. He was a boxing manager and knew incisately
all Cuber personalities engaged in the sporting industry. He had a puppy-
dog loyalty to his case officers and to the Agency. His biggest weakness
was his lack of discretion. He was such a loyal American (actually if
not technically) that he would fight at the drop of a hat if anyone cast
espersions on the United States or its leaders. In the atmosphere of
Castro's Cuba I might say that thet was quite often. we are in the
process of helping him recover his lost Americean citizenship. When the
Station reopens I would certainly recommend that we continue to maintain
contact with Sarker. If nothing else he would make a wonderful leg-man
for the Chief of Station. His wife is an attractive Cuien gal who is bi-
lingual end as belligerently "American" as he is. Darker, by locks and
by language, could pass either as an American or a Cuban a genuine
asset if he could be taught to submerge hie americanisa,
