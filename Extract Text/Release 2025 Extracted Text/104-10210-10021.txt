Statements of Soviet Officials About NOSENKO
4 February 1964
NOSENKO defected in Geneva.
6 February 1964
The Chief of the Soviet Disarmament Delegation notified
the Soviet Ambassador in Bern shortly before noon that
NOSENKO had disappeared, correctly placing the date as
4 February. They speculated privately between themselves
that he might have been "poisoned" or injured in an auto-
mobile accident.
8 February 1964
An official spokesman of the Soviet Mission in Geneva
reported to the Swiss police that NOSENKO, an "expert
temporarily assigned to Geneva", had been missing for four
days.
9 February 1964
Evening news broadcasts in Geneva carried reports
attributed to both Soviet and Swiss sources that NOSENKO
had disappeared.
10 February 1964
The Swiss press quoted unidentified Soviet sources
as saying it was presumed that NOSENKO had defected.

A U.S. Department of State press release was issued
identifying NOSENKU as KGB officer and acknowledging his
request for political asylum in the United States.
According to a sensitive source,
Because of his
long tenure in the KGB, NOSLNKO would have a great deal of
important information which he could impart to intelligence
agencies of other countries. Certainly, he would be
acquainted with many KGB employees and could identify them.
He also would be intimately acquainted with a large number
of Soviet agents working inside the USSR against American
and British nationals.
According to a sensitive source,
The bulk of NOSENKO's knowledge concerning
KGB activities, would revolve around the intelligence
operations of the KGB in Moscow and also KGB personalities
working in Headquarters. NOSENKO was also undoubtedly
familiar with all KCB personalities in Geneva and certainly
knew some KGB personalities in other countries.
Comment:
NOSENKO identified a number of KGB officers in
Geneva; he asserted that some others,..known
by CIA to be connected with the KGB, were not.

According to a sensitive source
NOSENKO was affiliated with the KGB for
approximately sixteen years, since about 1947, and was an
employee of the Second Chief Directorate in Moscow. His
father, now dead, was a Deputy to the Prime Minister of the
Soviet Union and also Minister of the Shipbuilding Industry.
There is a shipyard named after NOSENKO's father in the.
Ukraine.
Comment:
NOSENKO claims to have served in the GRU until
1953, when he entered the EGB.
According to a sensitive source,
It appeared quite certain to
several KGB
officers that NOSENKO had the rank of lieutenant colonel in the KG3.
Comment:
NOSENKO was at the time claiming to have been
a KGB iieutenant colonel.
According to a sensitive source,

The
photograph which appeared in l.S. newspapers is not that of
NOSENKO.One worked with NOSENKO for several years
in KGB Headquarters; he described NOSENKO as a person who
likes to be fashionably dressed at all times and is fond
of women, by nature a friendly individual and generally
well-liked by his fellow workers. NOSENKO worked in the
Second Chief Directorate.

The photograph accompanying American
and Swiss press accounts of NOSENKO's defection
was by error not that of NOSENKO but of
Vladimir SHUSTOV, whom and NOSENKO both
identified as a "clean" Soviet diplomat at the
Geneva Disarmament Conference.
Noting the publicity accompanying the defection of KGB
officer NOSENKO in Switzerland, GOLITSYN recalled that
NOSENKO had been a Second Chief Directorate officer working
against American citizens.
Comment:
Routinely, GOLITSYN had reviewed in March 1962
(before NOSENKO contacted CIA) a list of
Soviet delegates to the Disarmament Conference.
NOSENKO's name, which was on the list, did not
at that time prompt any comment from GOLITSYN.
11 February 1964
Ambassador DOBRYNIN informally notified the Department
of State that a Soviet note would be delivered later to ask
how NOSENKO had left Switzerland, to request his release,
and to dewand an immediate interview with him.
12 February 1964
S.K. TSARAPKIN, the head of the Soviet Delegation to the
Disarmament Conference, read a statement at a press conference
in which he strongly condemned the Swiss authorities for
permitting NOSENKO's "kidnapping" and for hindering efforts
to locate him. TSARAPKIN demanded that immediate steps be
taken to return NOSENKO to Soviet custody.,

At simultaneous press conferences in Bern and Geneva, the
Swiss rejected these accusations of non-cooperation and noted
the Soviet delay in advising the police of NOSENKO's disappea--
rance and Soviet failure to cooperate with Swiss authorities
in locating NOSENKO.
The Soviet note earlier promised. by DOBRYNIN was delivered
to the State Department. A noncommittal reply was given to
Soviet queries concerning the requested interview and the
means of NOSENKO's departure from Switzerland.
The Swiss Embassy asked for a meeting with NOSENKO in
order to obtain assurance that the defection had been
voluntary. Arrangements were made to have NOSENKO meet with
Swiss and Soviet representatives in Washington as soon as
possible.
NOSENKO arrived in Washington at 2130 hours.
12-13 February 196い
14 February 1964
In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Minister GROMYKO read to
Ambassador KOHLER a statement deploring the "evasive" reply
of the State Department to Soviet inquiries in Washington

GROMIKO repeated the demand for NOSENKO's immediate release
from American custody.
The Counselor of the Swiss Embassy interviewed NOSENKO at
the Washington offices of the U.S. Immigration and Naturali-
zation Service. The Soviet confrontation immediately after-
wards was handled by Minister Counselor G.M. KORNIENKO, and
Third Secretary V.F. ISANOV, a recent arrival in Washington.
NOSENKO told both the swiss and the Soviets that he had
defected of his own free will after careful consideration
and that he had no desire to return to the Soviet Union.
response to KORNIENKO's questions, he specifically renounced
his status and rights as a Soviet citizen.
18 February 1964
Feliks KOVALEV, a Soviet diplomat in Buenos Aires, told
a CIA agent that he had attended the Institute of Inter-
national Relations with NOSENKO. According to KOVALEV,

Second Directorates of the KGB and is familiar with so many
individuals in the KGB both in Moscow and abroad.a KGB officer
said that PLNKOVSKIY was able to furnish American and
British Intelligence with a lot of information concerning

According to a sensitive source, in response to a question
whether NOSLIKO actually defected or whether the defection might be a
KGB "trick", the source replied that fron his own knowledge of this matter,
he was convinced that SEIKO's defection was not a "trick" by the KGB.
22 February 1964
:
According to a sensitive source from conversations with various unnamed. KOB
officers: NOSENKO worked against personnel
stationed at th. American Erbassy in Moscow, and with his
help agents were developed among these Americans. It is
assumed by the KGS that he is familiar with the number and
locatior of micropan.n the Tabassy.
Comment:
Although NOSENKO knew that there were micro-
phones in three general locations in the
Embassy, his specific information regarding
the number and location of microphones was
limited to that contained in a written list
brought to Geneva in 1964, a list which he
clained no one in the KGB knew he had.

foreign embassy in Moscow. Following the
defection of Yuriy Vasilyevich KROTKOV in
England in 1963, his wife appeared at the
British Frbassy to make inquiries about him.
According to a sensitive source,
KUROCHKIN (fnu),
a KGB S&T officer scheduled for assigament to Washington,
will not be sent as he is "well-known" to NOSENKO. In the
course of his duties in Moscow, KUROCHKIN had very often
visited the department where NOSENKO worked and, as a
result, NOSENKO is "more than casually acquainted with him".

defection. He volunteered to CIA that he attended & naval
preparatory school with the son of Minister NOSENKO in
1944-1946.
Comment:
ARTAMONOV's description of the school and of
the dates involved differs from those claimed

KGB officer Vladimir TULAYEV mentioned NOSENKO to a
CIA double agent in Vienna. TULAYEV said that NOSENKO,
whom he knew well, came from a wonderful family, loved his
wife and children, and earned a good salary. (TULAYEV
later said on another occasion that he had friends who

details about life of the leaders of the country, in the

There seems to be unanimous opinion among
KGB
chiefs that NOSENKO...could do the KGB a tre-
rendous amount of harm. NOSENKO in his position as a de-
puty chief in one of the departments of the Second Chief
Directorate would have been entitled to have one personnel
directory of approximately 30 pages setting for the iden-
tities of all of the supervisory officials in KGB Head-
quarters. NOSENKO would also have had a 200-page directory
listing by name and telephone number all the rank-and-file
employees working in Moscow. The opinion was expressed by
some KGB 'chiefs" that if NOSENKO
were merely able to make these two directories available
to American Intelligence, the KGB would be severely damaged
for the present and for several years to come.
Comment: NOSENKO has never referred to the KGB direc-
tories described.

KGB officers I.I. PETUKHOV nad P.P. BORISOV in Canada

with passport photographs so that "escape" documents could
be prepared for himself and his family. SPRECHER asked
whether the action had any connection with NOSENKO's recent-
ly publicized defection, but the KGB officers denied it,

KGB officer G.S. VLASOV, case officer of Robert Lee
JOHNSON in Paris, began to meet JOHNSON on the street rather
than in various restaurants as had been their habit. At one
of their final meetings before JOHNSON returned to the United
States, VLASOV told JOHNSON that a Soviet Intelligence officer
had defected to the Americans in Geneva, and that extreme
caution must therefore be exercised in JOHNSON's contacts
with the KGB. VLASOV said that the defector could not identify
JOHNSON but that JOHNSON should dispose of everything he had
which might link him to Soviet espionage activities.

According to a sensitive source from a KGB officer
The KGB was lucky that the Americans found only
40 microphones in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. Actually,
about 200 microphones were concealed by the Soviets in the
Embassy. NOSLNKO was responsible for furnishing information
to the Americans which resulted in the microphones being
found. NOSENKO knew only the general location of the 40
microphones which were found and does not have any knowledge
of the remaining ones.

Professor John M. THOMPSON reported at the American

is that in the future the KGB will be feeling sharply the
effects of NOSENKO's escape to American Intelligence.
NOSENKO is considered to be vastly more important than either
GOLITSYN or DERYABIN. This opinion appears to be based on
several factors: First, NOSENKO worked against personnel
stationed at the American Embassy in Moscow and with his help
agents were developed among these Americans. Second, it is
assumed by KGB personnel that because of his closeness to

the American Embassy in the past, NOSENKO would also be
familiar with the number of microphones which had been
installed in the Embassy by the KGB and the locations of
these microphones. Third, as a Deputy Chief of a depart-
ment, NOSENFO would normally have had access to a telephone
directory listing all personnel in all directorates of the
KGB in Moscow. Another factor, which is a formidable one
in the minds of other KGB employees, is that NOSENKO
travelled in a rather influential circle of friends in
Moscow who were high in the Soviet Government. All these
comments were cited as reasons for NOSENKO being an
"important catch" for American Intelligence, but no one in
the KGB really knows exactly how much information NOSENKO
had concerning the KGB.
29 June 1964
GOLITSYN (from personal acquaintance): NOSENKO, the son
of the former Minister of Shipbuilding, was a KGB officer
who had worked in the American Department and the Seventh
Department of the Second Chief Directorate. GOLITSYN, while
on his own First Chief Directorate business, met NOSENKO two:
or three times in the American Embassy Section in 1953,
and had seen him occasionally at work during 1958 and 1959.
When GOLITSYN asked him where he was working in 1959, NOSENKO
replied that he was assigned to the Seventh Department..
NOSENKO served in the American Embassy Section from 1953
until 1957 or 1958, and was specifically responsible for
KGB coverage of American military personnel in Moscow during
1953. For the remainder of his service in the Embassy Section
until 1957 or 1958, NOSENKO may have had the same responsi-
bilities or may have been working against other Embassy
personnel or correspondents, but he was definitely in the
American Department during the entire period. In 1957 or
1958 NOSENKO was transferred to the Seventh Department, and
was a senior case officer there as of 1959. NOSENKO did not
work in the American Department of the Second Chief Directorate
American Department at any time during 1960; GOLITSYN visited
the Embassy Section on at least three occasions from early
1960 to early 1961, and would have known if NOSENKO had been
in the Section, particularly if NOSENKO had been Deputy Chief.
C.I. GRYAZNOV was acting as assistant of the Chief of the
Section during this period.

"Just after" HOSENKO'
defection V.S. MEDVEDEV from the Exits Commission of the
CPSU Central Committee travelled to Geneva to speak to the
Soviets stationed there and to Soviet delegates to the Disarm-
ament Conference.
MEDVEDEV underscored the seriousness of
the defection and urged greater vigilance against such acts.
The defection caused the recall of Nina Ivanovna YEREMEYEVA,
a KCB secretary in Geneva. It was rumored that some sixty
Soviet officials stationed abroad would be transferred from
their assignment as a consequence of the NOSENKO affair.
V.A. POCIMANKIN, a KGB officer with the permanent Soviet
Mission in Geneva, speculated that he had been completely
exposed by NOSENKO and would therefore have to return to
Moscow. Yu. I. GUK who was known Source

(from unnamed sources, presumably KCB officers
): An investigating commission of the
CPSU Central Committee checking into the circumstances
surrounding NOSINKO's defection has thus far been responsible
for the expulsion from the KGB of 15 Second Chief Directorate
employees. These include GRIBANOV, who was also expelled
from the CPSU and was stripped of his rank of lieutenant
general. GRIBANOV has been given a very small pension, like
an ordinary Soviet citizen. This drastic action was taken
since the primary responsibility for the defection was placed
on GRIBANOV. It was realized that, in addition to being Chief
of the Second Chief Directorate at the time of the defection,
GRIBANOV was a personal friend of NOSENKO and had more or
less treated NOSENKO as a protege and had taken many steps
to further NOSENKO's career within the KCB. It was felt
that GRIBANOV should have been aware of NOSENKO's plans to
defect. Three of CRIBANOV's deputies were also expelled
from the KGB, one of whom was a Major General BANNIK
[BANNIKOV]. Of the 11 other Second Chief Directorate employees
expelled, some were found to have been personal friends of
NOSENKO and some of them were found to have confided to NOSENKO
details of operations in which they were working. S.M. GOLUBEV,
a KGB officer stationed in Washington, would be leaving for
Moscow because the investigating commission had determined
that Yu. I. GUK, a mutual friend of NOSENKO and GOLUBEY told
NOSENKO that GOLUBEV had been assigned to the Washington Legal

December 1964
GAMKRFLIDZE is suspected of having connections
with Soviet Intelligence because of his
statements, actions, and unusual freedom of
solitary movement while on visits to the United
States. CAMKKELIDZE rebuffed a CIA recruitment
attempt in 1964, but added that he "welcomed
the opportunity to meet with an American
Inteiligence officer...to compare the Soviet
Intelligence officers he had met with their
American counterparts". During that 1964
meeting GAMKRELIDZE again raised the subject
of NOSENKO, describing him as "obviously a
traitor to his country".

According to a sensitive source
(from conversations with unrecalled KGB officers
It is common knowledge among
F.GB employees that GRIBANOV was expelled from the KGB and
CPSU and is now on pension, partial rather than full, as a
result of the NOSENKO defection. When NOSENKO was being
considered for assignment to Geneva (in 1964), a summary.

Directorate and sent to GRIBANOV. This summary contained
considerable. "compromising information", concerning NOSENKO;
if acted upon properly, it would have removed him from
consideration for this trip. GRIBANOV read the summary.
material, ran a line through all of it, and added the nota-
tion: "Send him to Geneva." The general feeling is that
GRIBANOV was willing to overlook a lot of NOSENKO's
deficiencies because of CRIBANOV's long-time friendship
with NOSENKO's father.
Comment:
NOSENKO originally asserted that GRIBANOV
was responsible for sending him to Geneva in
1964, but after retracting his claim that
GRIBANOV had played any special role in his
assignments, he asserted that BANNIKOV approved
the 1964 trip. NOSENKO denies that his father
and GRIBANOV were acquainted.
