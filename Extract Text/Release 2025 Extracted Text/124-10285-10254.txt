At the meeting, Fernandez suggested that
a committee be formed and efforts made to have
the committee travel to Cuba for a conference
with Cuban officials, in order to discuss the

that the discussion concerning political prisoners
could be expanded to include a discussion of
differences between Cuba and the United States.
Those in attendance agreed that such a discussion
would be timely, inasmuch as it appears that Fidel
Castro is not completely satisfied with Cuba's
relations with the Soviet Union. If the discuss-
ion of the relations between Cuba and the United
States should prove productive, such information
