8. Miguel Angel DIAZ Isalque: I showed P the letter from DIAZ to the
PO Box 982 Coral Gables box; Faid he did not know that address and had no
idea how DIAZ might have got it. I told Pit was a sensitive ad ress which we
did not want to have blown, asked him to contact DIAZ, ostensibly because
KALBING (who long ago was having P prime DIAZ for a trip to Madrid, which
never came off) had sent regards and an explanation of why the Madrid thing
fell thru) Pis to make no mention of the Coral Gables address or the letter,
but assuming DIAZ will bring it up, to try to discover how DIAZ got that address,
while also discovering what it is DIAZ had in mind when he wrote the letter.
P thinks he has DIAZ phone number, if necessary can use the ploy of having
seen DIAZ TV ad for his furniture store>

APARTMENT. ON THE BASIS OF THIS ALERT, POSITIONED ANCHALK/5
NEAR GARAGE WHERE AMWOLF/1 PARKS HIS CAR.
2. AT 1656 HOURS 16 OCTOBER WHEN AMWOLF/! LEFT THE GARAGE,
AMCHALY/5 WAS ABLE TO STOP HIM HALF A BLOCK FROM HIS APARTMENT
AND CARRIED ON A SIX MINUTE CONVERSATION. INITIALLY AMWOLF/1
WAS COLD, VISUALLY UPSET BUT LATER BECAME JOVIAL. AT FIRST
INSISTED THAT AMCHALK/5 COME TO THE CONSULATE OR CALL HIM TO
SET UP MEETING. HOWEVER, ANCHALK/5 INSISTED THEY TALK THEN
AND AMWOLF/1 AGREED. AFTER AMCHALK/5 MADE THE PITCH, AMWOLF/I
REACTED BY SAYING "THESE 'JOHNIES HAVE EVERYTHING AND NOW THEY
REALLY STEPPED ON ME". AMWOLF/1 ENDED THE CONVERSATION BY
AGAIN AKSING AMCHALK/5 TO COME TO CONSULATE OR CALL HIM SO THEY
COULD HAVE ANOTHER TALK. AMWOLF/1 RETURNED TO THE CAR WHERE HIS
WIFE WAS WAITING AND STARTED THE MOTOR AND THEN STOPPED AGAIN AND
GOT OUT. HE THEN HAD AMCHALK/5 COME OVER AND INTRODUCED HIS

MEMORANDUM FORL Record
SUBJECT
: Heeting with AMCHALK-5
TIME AND PLACE: Miami, 3 and 4 OCTOBER
1. I met AMCHALK-5 at 1430 hours at the Rusty Pelican
Restuarant. I told him we would like to have him travel
immediatoly in order to arrive in Madrid by 9 October. ANCHALK-5
said he could make it with no problem. He wasn't sure his wife
would be able to go on such short notice, but that didn't matter.
I briefed him on the contact arrangements sent from Madrid and
described WIBALDA to him. I told him WIBALDA'S name is "ROBERTO."
AMCHALK-5 said he would make the 0330 hours contact on 10 October,
but of course if something goes wrong that he will go to all
the alternate meetings. He will be wearing a white sports
jacket, white shirt, blus tie, blue slacks and black shoes.
2. I told AMCHALK-5 that WIBALDA would have the letter
for AMGHOST-1 for hia to take to the meeting, and I told him
again not to use the letter unless his recruitmont pitch had
no results. If he does pass the letter, I suggested that he
flex it to prove to AMWOLF-1 that it does not contain a bomb.
3. I told AMCHALK-5 that it looked good for a surprige
contact with AMWOLF-1 on 10 October and because ho would bo
going to lunch with a woman not connected with his offico.
AMCHALK-5 was pleased to hear this sa because he feels he must
make the contact unannounced for it to be effective. He said
that if the October 10 contact was missed, there would probably
be another luncheon the following week. AMCHALK-5 is willing
to stay in Madrid as long as nесеввагу.

4. AMCHALK-5 was sorry to hear that I won't be going to
Madrid because he wants to be sure that he is given as much
flexibility as possible, and not forced to handle the approach
in a manner that he would not be comfortable with. I told him
WE AMCHALK.S

that WIBALDA understood the situation, and that I was sure it
would all go well. AMCHALK-5 assured me that he has no inten-
tion of letting himself get into a physically dangerous situation
during the contact.
5. If the contact is made next wook, AMCHALK-5 will be
back before the PACHANKIS is. I said we would want to debrief
hia in Miami and that either I would see him or PACHANKIS would.
I said that if PACHANKIS talks to him, he can tell PACILANKIS the
completo details of the operation unless I phoned him otherwise.
5. We arranged to meet again at 1900 hours when AMCHALK-5
wogld have his itinerary, and I could pass him the money he needed.
AMCHALK-5 doesn't want to be paid for this job, but I insisted
again that we would pay all his expenses, and I told him to save
his totel bill and other receipts. We met at 1900 hours at the
Vizcaya bar and then drove around in AMCHALK-5's car. I passed
hia 81,500 for which he signed a receipt. AMCHALK-5 had gotten
reservations and will leave Miami for New York on 7 October and
- thes fly to Lisbon that same night. He will spend 8 and 9 October
in Lisbon where he will rent a car and drive to Madrid, arriving
in the evening on 9. October. He has reservations in the Agumar
Hotel for 9 October, and he will make the first contact at 0930
hours on 10 October.

I wished ANCHALK-5 good luck. He is much more optomistic
about his chances with AMWOLF-1 than I am, but it is good to work
with a man with enthusiaam. Just in case AMCHALK-5 should be
successful, we should be prepared to support him. I suggest that
ve cabie Madrid telling them what and how much we are willing to
offer should AMWOLF-1 be interested in defecting. I told AMCHALK-5
that he could promise usylum, but I did not tell him how much money
he could offer as an inducement for either recruitment in place or
defection.

that WIBALDA understood the situation, and that I was sure it
would all go well. AMCHALK-5 assured me that he has no inten-
tion of letting himself get into a physically dangerous situation
during the contact.
5. If the contact is made next wook, AMCHALK-5 will be
back before the PACHANKIS is. I said we would want to debrief
him in Miami and that either I would see him or PACHANKIS would.
I said that if PACHANKIS talks to him, he can tell PACILANKIS the
completo details of the operation unless I phoned him otherwise.
6. We arranged to meet again at 1900 hours when AMCHALK-5
wogld have his itinerary, and I could pass him the money he needed.
AMCHALK-5 doesn't want to be paid for this job, but I insisted
again that we would pay all his expenses, and I told him to save
his totel bill and other receipts. We met at 1900 hours at the
Vizcaya bar and then drove around in AMCHALK-5's car. I passed
him $1,300 for which he signed a receipt. AMCHALK-5 had gotten
