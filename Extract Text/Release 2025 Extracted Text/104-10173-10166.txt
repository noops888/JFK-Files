SUBJECT
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Dr. Martin Luther KING, Jr.
1. Reference is made to this Agency's out message
number 94270 dated 25 April 1968 concerning the assassi-
nation of Dr. Martin Luther KING, Jr..
1--
2. On 16 April Roderick Claflin BROWN, a Panamanian
national born 1 July 1917 in British Honduras, voluntarily
appeared at the Department of National Investigations (DENI)
of the Republic of Panama and signed a deposition, the
highlights of which are as follows:
(1) On 26 October 1962 he served as cook/seaman,
aboard the Texaco S.S. Southhampton which docked at Mobile,
Alabama.
(2) While on a shore visit to the Mobile airport
on the morning of 26 October 1962 in the company of two
fellow Panamanian seasen, he was approached by Marvin P.
LITTRELL, owner of LITTRELL Motor Co., 921-25 South Clinton
Street, Athens, Alabama, who after ascertaining BROWN was
a Panamanian seaman, asked if he knew of Dr. Martin Luther
KING, Jr.
(3) LITTRELL inquired whether BROWN was interested
in employment, the details of which were unspecified. He
went on to describe Dr. KING as "Our greatest problem who
16 causing us much trouble." He gave BROWN a business card
to use in the event he was interested in pursuing the employ-
ment offer.
(4) On 28 January 1963 BROWN wrote LITTRELL from
New York City, stating he was interested in a job and
SEURET
ここ

requested $75 for travel from New York City to Mobile.
On 2 February 1963 BROWN received a reply from LITTRELL,
restating that he had a job waiting for BROWN in Alabam,
but questioning why $75 was needed since the fare was less
than $40 by bus.
(5) After discussions with a relative and friends
in New York City, BROWN suspected that the LITTRELL job
offer was related with assassination plans for Dr. KING.
Therefore he did not respond to the LITTRELL letter and
dismissed the incident until the death of Dr. KING in
April 1968. BROWN returned to Panama in 1964.
3. Enclosed for your information is a copy of the
LITTRELL letter and the Spanish language deposition made
by BROWN, as well as an English translation of the deposition
as described in paragraph 2 of the referenced out message.

10 July
1. IDEN A, a cleared and witting contact, provided the
following information which was obtained during a surveillance
of IDEN C. The surveillance was a joint effort of IDEN A and
local ODENVY. ODENVY is not aware that IDEN A has passed the
information to JMWAVE.
2. On Thursday, 19 May 1966, a surveillance was instituted
from Room 618 of IDEN Bon adjoining Room 620, which was occupied
by IDEN C and his aide IDEN D. The surveillance was initiated at
11:00 a.m. and terminated at 5:15 p.m. During the conversation
between IDENS C and D and another unknown Negro male, believed
to be IDEN E, references were made to the Florida Gubernatorial
Race; a trip to Bimini; and several miscellaneous sex experiences.
3. On 20 May 1966 a search was made of rooms. 620 and 622
after IDENS Cand D moved out, Forwarded under separate cover
are copies of items found in the waste baskets and dressers;
a hotel bill, and a list of telephone numbers which were called
on 18-19 May 1966.
4. Of special interest among these items was a note which
stated, IDEN F, please call Long Distance. Operator IDEN G..
IDEN H, according to IDEN A, is an identified member of the
Communist Party. Also, an envelope of IDEN B with the name
IDEN 1. This person may have been one of the occupants of the
room who remained in the company of IDENS C and Dovernight.
5. JMWAVE traces were negative on all personalities
mentioned above as well as those names appearing in the date
forwarded under separate cover. JMWAVE has carded only those
