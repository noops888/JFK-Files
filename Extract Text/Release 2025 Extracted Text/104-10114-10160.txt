2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
3/8/61
To: Mr. Jack Kennedy
WH/4/Security
Mr. Kennedy,
Several months ago I wrote you a letter concerning the Pro-Castro senti-
ments of Court Wood, son of Foster Wood, a local attorney. Since that time I've
seen Court only once, on March 3, 1961, and he appears to be actively engaged
in the organization of a local chapter of the FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE.
Complete with beard, Court has been meeting with "interested groups" and lect-
uring to students in several eastern cities. He specifically mentioned Baltimore,
Philadelphia, and New York. Apparently there are a number of students involved
in this activity; I met David Lacterman from George Mason High School in
Falls Church, Va. and Walt MacDonald, a fellow student of Court's, and both
are obviously active.
What action, if any, should I take in regard to my relationship with
Court and his father?
Please include this statement in my permanent record.
THANK YOU
Michael Stratton
WH/4/Reg.
