Chief, Miami Field Office
IHEN A, ex-BKHERALD Staff Employee.
1. We met with IDEN A, a retired BKHERALD staff employee, on 7
January 1976 at his home in Tampa, Florida. IDEN A had requested the
meeting through contact with an attorney in IDEN B. IDEN A sroke for
several hours about his life since retirement in 1971. What follows is
a long summation of his comments, and at the memo's conclusion his reasons
for bringing this situation to our attention. (Forwarded under Separate
Cover].
2. IDEN A, who had a major role in the Bay of Pigs activities, and
who was associated with JMHAVE during the period 1961-68, has maintained
many contacts within the Cuban community in Florida. LNCOLLAR, which
was aware of the involvement of some ex-BKHERALD assets (Cubans) in the
drug importation business, had been unable to penetrate this group in
the period to late 1973. IDEN A, in the meantime, had moved to Key West,
Florida, purchased a lobster fishing boat and equipment, and become a
respected member of the community.
3. In late 1973, a former BKHERALD asset (AMTABY Project) who had
been terminated in 1963, IDEN C, came to IDEN A in Key West, claimed he
had escaped from jail in Cuba in 1970 (where he had been jailed for drug
running between Cuba and WODUAL), and said he had information on drug
traffic. He asked IDEN A to contact someone in LNCOLLAR and indicate
IDÈN C's willingness to be of assistance. IDEN A replied he was retired
and could not help. A few months later, IDEN D (ANTABY-27), another
former asset, flew to Key West from Miami. He met IDEN A and informed
him LNCOLLAR had sent him down to check on IDEN C. IDEN D identified
his LNCOLLAR contact as IDEN E, an ex-BKHERALD 'asset and former BKHERALD
contract employee. At about this time IDEN F, a former BKHERALD staff
employee, moved to Key West and informed IDEN A that LNCOLLAR was being
staffed with BKHERALD employees in its Intelligence Division, and that
the leader of the division was IDEN G, another ERMERALD staffer.
4. A few months later, IDEN A received a call from IDEN H, another
BEHERALD retires, who asked about IDEN A's access to boats IDEN H wished
to purchase for a relative of his wife, the relative residing in Venezuela.
He photographed every boat in the Key West harbor, and it was apparent to
IDEN A he was LNCCLEAR-involved. Later, IDEN F approached IDEN A and said

two EKIDRALD paupio in Filand wanted to meet with IDEN A. IDEN A agreed
to a meeting, and IDEN F introduced IDEN I and IDEN E. IDEN-A know-
IDEN I, but was aware of IDEE only by reputation, which was unsavory.
IDEN E claimed to be a BKHERALD employee, as did IDER I. IDEN A, of
course, knew otherwise, but said nothing. In March 1974, IDEN A got a
call from IDEN J of the IDEN K, Miami. He was an ex-EKHERALD officer,
and he said IDEN C wished to speak with IDEN A in Miami on an urgent
basis.
5. IDEN G told IDEN A that he wanted the latter to work for LNCOLLAR
to establish intelligence networks in the Cuban community in Key West. He
said no one else could do it, and he promised to provide at the start
US$100/week plus expenses plus money to pay IDEN A's agents. He said
this money would not be reportable as income. When IDEN A asked about
the effect of his own ex-BKHERALD status, IDEN G replied BKHERALD does
not want or need to know of this arrangement. IDEN G acknowledged that
US$100/week was a small payment, but said any information resulting in a
seizure of drugs, the arrest of drug traffickers, or damage to drug rings
will be assessed by a board within LNCOLLAR, and money (thousands of
dollars) rewarded for this assistance. IDEN A would then be free to split
the money with his agents. IDEN J, who was at the meeting, added that
within a year IDEN A should be able to afford the best and largest lobster
boat available.
6. IDEN G and IDEN J impressed IDEN A with the dangerous nature
of his assignment. They stressed cover as the most important consideration,
and IDEN G said, "I don't want to go to any more funerals". They added
that if IDEN A got into trouble, there were 150 LNCOLLAR agents in Miami
who would come to his aid instantly. IDEN A was given emergency telephone
numbers and code names, and was told LNCOLLAR would arrange for his
airlift out (through the LNTUCK Aar Station) if needed. If his LNCOLLAR
affiliation was blown, IDEN G said there would be compensation provided
up to US$40 thousand, as well as relocation assistance. The relocation
assistance was not specified, but IDEN A assumed this meant six months
living expenses and assistance in job search activities, as well as
reimbursement for moving expenses. IDEN J and IDEN L, another ex-BKHERALD
official, were to come to Key West one week later to brief IDEN A on the
local situation. In the meantime, IDEN A was to prepare a report on what
he knew about drug traffickers in the Key West area. Two weeks later,
the two did appear in Key West. The little they knew about Key West drug
activities was included in IDEN A's report, which also contained much
additional data.
7. IDEN A subsequently set up an intelligence net, and began serding
back reports. IDEN A was frequently summoned to Miami for meetings with
IDEN G. Often these meetings were a waste of time, and on occasion IDEN G

would not even show up. At one point IDEN J asked IDEN A to write a
paper on-the-capability of ex-BKHERALD assets who were drug traffickers,
and who had been trained in infiltration and exfiltration, to penetrate
WODUAL coastal defenses with drugs. IDEN A showed how the assets could
circumvent any government effort to stop the drug traffic. The paper
"scared LNCOLLAR to death," according to IDEN A. At the end of June 1974,
IDEN Jasked IDEN A to journey to Washington to brief top LNCOLLAR
officiala on his conclusions. It was to be an all expense paid trip, and
IDEN A flew up and stayed one week. Total remuneration received for the
journey was only US$150. During the week, IDEN A had many meetings with
LDEN G and, his deputy, IDEN M, a former IDEN N staff employee. IDEN G
indicated at that time he was impressed with IDEN A's reports and access
in Key West...

had been no arrests, and therefore no bonuses. IDEN A said he would no
longer work for just US$100/week. IDEN G replied he might be able to
maka "IDEN A a LNCOLLAR consultant to protect his retired status. lle also
promised-IDEN A a large lobster boat (taken from those confiscated in
LNCOLLAR raids), and an additional US$500/month to meet expenses and
agent payoffs. IDEN C also spoke of using. IDEN A in LNCOLLAR activities
in Jamaica and South America. Nothing ever was forthcoming on ary of
these matters. During this period, IDEN A also provided LNCOLLAR (at its
requesc) with the names of potential sources of information in the Miami
area. Several persons were approached by LNCOLLAR using IDEN A's name,
and a number of former BKHERALD assets were picked up in this manner.
Included in this group are IDEN O, IDEN P, and IDEN Q.
9. In May 1974, IDEN F came to IDEN A at a party and, while drunk,
said he had heard IDEN G wanted to recruit IDEN A for LNCOLLAR activities.
In June he made similar comments while at another social gathering. IDEN A
made no comment (other than requesting that IDEN F shut up). When IDEN A
was recruited by IDEN G and IDEN J, they had made quite a point of saying
only they would be aware of IDEN A's LNCOLLAR ties. Later in June 1974,
IDEN F said he knew IDEN A was working with INCOLLAR. In July 1974,
IDEN G said he did not like having IDEN L, who was IDEN A's handling
officer in Miami, dealing with him since IDEN L was known to be an
LNCOLLAR officer. IDEN C wanted to have IDEN A deal directly with him
in Washington, but IDEN A objected, saying the arrangement was too
cumbersome. In late July, IDEN G introduced IDEN A to his new contact,
IDEN I.
10. In November 1974, it became apparent the drug ring in Key West
on which IDEN A's group was reporting was becoming spooked and overly
cautious. Through several of his agents IDEN A learned this resulted
COL

from a direct approach to the violators by LNCOLLAR officer IDEN E, who
had come to Key West unbeknownst to IDEN A. Through friends in Miami,
IDEN A found out IDEN E was in charge of IDEN A's operation in Key West,
had a homosexual relationship with IDEN F which went back for many years
(and was responsible for the breakup of IDEN E's first marriage), had big
real estate deals going in Miami, had a Swiss bank account, and was still
using BKHERALD cover in Miami.
11. IDEN P, who was aware of IDEN E's LNCOLLAR connection, and two
other LNCOLLAR assets in the Miami area, had agreed to assist LNCOLLAR
only if LNCOLLAR officials could guarantee IDEN E would never know of
their relationship or see any of their informant reports. IDEN I arranged
for this through IDEN G, and the three agents' files were placed in
IDEN M's safe. IDEN A subsequently has learned IDEN E routinely saw
all of IDEN P's reports. Later, when the revelations in the preceding
paragraph were known, IDEN I told IDEN A there were many allegations about
IDEN E, and that he had mentioned this to IDEN G. IDEN G had assured
him he would be brought to Washington to discuss the matter, but nothing
ever came of it. Ironically, IDEN E was taken into LNCOLLAR on the orders
of LECOLLAR Director IDEN R, and it was specified that no clearance or
background check would be undertaken on him.
12. IDEN I and IDEN A decided to approach IDEN F to learn more about
IDEN E. During a one hour discussion, MEN F said he had been appointed
the recruiting officer within BKHERALD for persons who wou'd go to
LACOLLAR. IDEN F said he had known IDEN E for a long period of time, and
had brought him along in BKHERALD hierarchy. IDEN A believes IDEN F
also engineered the absence of a security check on IDEN Z by LACCLLAR
since he did not want his homosexual relationship with IDEN E revealed.
At that point IDEN A called IDEN G and filled him in on what had been
learned, including IDEN F's admission that DEN E had told him IDEN A
was an LNCOLLAR asset. IDEN G. denied knowing IDEN F, but said he would
check on IDEN E. IDEN A met with DEN G the next day in Miami to fill
him in further, and IDEN G ordered a full investigation. In the meantime,
IDEN F told DEN E of his meeting with IDEN I and IDEN A, and IDEN Σ
wrote a memorandum saying a fellow LNCOLLAR officer (IDEN I) had over
stepped the bounds of propriety in his relationship with an LNCOLLAR
asset (IDEN A), and that IDEN I and IDE A were ruaning an investigation
on IDEN 5. IDEN E described the situation as "intolerable".
inquiry, then, turned from IDEN E to improper actions by IDEN I in
discussing an LNCOLLAR employee with an asset. The Internal Affairs
section of LNCOLLAR did continue the IDEN E probe and concluded by May 1975
that the charges against IDEN & were accurate. In the meantime, IDEN I
was interrogated by IDEN M on his relationship with IDEN A.

13. In August 1975, IDEN G informed IDEN A that control of his
operation was being transferred to the Miami regional office, and that
his financial relationship with LNCOLLAR would be terminated and then
re-established locally following 1 September 1975. On 9 September 1975,
a state-federal task force arrested 39 persons in Key West. IDEN A knew
nothing about the arrests in advance. He called IDEN G to find out what
was happening, and IDEN G said he also was unaware of them. He asked
IDEN A to continue reporting on these developments. The next day IDEN A
met with a source who told him someone had blown IDEN A's LNCOLLAR
affiliation to the drug ring. He described the leak as coming from an
ex-BKHERALD officer who hated IDEN A. IDEN A's source, who was in touch
with drug ring members, toid IDEN A the codename of his LNCOLLAR operation
(IDEN S), and IDEN A. learned IDEN F had spread this word all over town.
IDEN A subsequently received telephone death threats (one of the ring
member's girl friend called to tell him a white LNCOLLAR informant (IDEN A)
would not get out of town alive). There had been eight informant deaths
in Monroe County (Key West) in 1975, all unsolved murders. There was
every reason, then, to take the threats seriously. IDEN A informed
LNCOLLAR about the threats. LNCOLLAR replied that. IDEN A was pushing the
panic button, and askol for more information. IDEN A requested that the
emergency evacuation apparatus be used, but LNCOLLAR refused. Finally,
LNCOLLAR said "We don't know what you expect us to do since you've been
terminated". IDEN A, who had been terminated by LNCOLLAR/Washington,
had not been picked up subsequently by the Miami Regional Office.
14. IDEN A, desiring to keep a low profile, could not talk to many
of his agents in Key West, but the fow he did reach were expecting a
portion of the reward money since the ring that was rolled up was one the
agents had reported on for many months. IDEN A checked with LNCOLLAR
on this, and was informed his net's information was not used as tho basis
for the arrests. IDEN A learned that IDEN F had passed the word around
Key West that IDEN A was not an LNCOLLAR staff employee, which made IDEN A
fair game for removal. He also learned plans had been made locally for
his murder. At that point, IDEN A then made his escape with his wife.
In Miami, he mot with IDEN M. IDEN H claimed IDEN E had not caused any
of the problems IDEN A had experienced. Concerning money assurances,
IDEN M first denied any promises had been made. Later he said any that
had been made (by IDEN G) were unauthorized. Ha reiterated IDEI A's
reporting, although accurate, was not used in the arrests. LACOLLAR
agreed to provide LDEN A with US$1800 for all his problems, and raised
the sum later to US$3 thousand. IDEN A accepted the money, but did not
indicate he was satisfied with this sum.
15. IDEN A snuck back into Key West and packed his household goods
in one evening. liis boat was given to a fish supply house to sell. Sinca
he owed the company money for supplies he had purchased, the rish house
NFL-002-76
PAGE 6
sold the boat for a sum equal to his debts. IDEN A's wife quit her job
without notice, and he estimates his actual financial losses are
US$25 thousand. LICOLLAR has indicated the US$3 thousand paywant is
"all IDEN A will get", and he is determined to get more.
16. IDEN A believes many of his agents think he did receive a payoff
from LNCOLLAR following the arrests, and that he took all the money and
ran, leaving then axposol in Key West. The cars of two of his agents
were burned, and IDEN D, IDEN P. and others in the Miami area quit working
for LNCOLLAR when they learned of the treatment he had received and/or
received death threats themselves. IDENT. As a result, IDEN A cannot
return to Key Wost, and his lobster business no longer exists.
17. The purpose of IDEN A's contacting the RKHERALD is first to
let us know what has happened to many of its former employees and assets.
IDEN A believes BKHERALD should know of the false provises that were used
to lure some BKHERALD employees to work at LNCOLLAR. As documentation,
he provided IDEN l'a grievance letter to INCOLLAR which is attached and
for retention. IDEN I has, incidentally, been taken out of the Intelligence
Division of LACOLLAR and placed in enforcement work in Miami. IDEN I
1s currently seeking to return to BKHERALD employment, and IDEN A says
IDEN I will verify his statements on the treatment of BKHERALD personnel
who transferred to LICOLLAR. (IDEN I's home phone in Miami is IDEN I.)
He and the other ex-BKHERALD employees working at a lower level ara fed
up with LNCOLLAR, and are convinced they will never receive fair treatment
in that organization. Since IDEN A believes the recruitment of BKHERALD
officers to switch to LNCOLLAR will be a continuing thing, he feals we
should know the realities of life in LNCOLLAR.
*[Forwarded Separately)
18. In addition, he notes LNCOLLAR is using many retired BKHERALD
people and former BKHERALD assets in its activities. IDEN A believes
these persons, in many instances, are being both used and abused. Any
flap which occurs as a result of LACOLLAR mismanagement will bounce
back on BRIERALD, since it appears BKHERALD is involved in the LICOLLAR
operation. Indeed, IDEN G has given the impression his activities have
been cleared with and approved by BKHERALD. Those assets who are being
turned off by LNCOLLAR mismanagement are going to be lost to BEHERALD es
well as to LSCOLLAR. Some of these persons could be significant asseis
14 years to come.
19. A flap may not be so far off. In recent weeks IDEN U, whe 18
writing a book about the role of the Cubans IDEN V and IDEN W in the
IDEN X affair, called IDEN A and said he has information that IDEN G's
wife and IDEN Y's business manager made a trip to Florida recently.
Also IDEN U said he hae learned that a former BKMERALD man who is a
COMTAL
NFL-002-76
PAGE 7
LNCOLLAR agent is a honosexual, and that US$15 thousand in LNCOLLAR
funds were given to someone in Mizal to bail out a Puerto Rican drug
dealer. The investigation of DE 2 by INCOLLAR internal affairs did
reveal, according to IDEN A, that Ust15 thousand could not be accounted
for by IDEN E, whose career appears to have bean unaffected by the
invescigatiou. IDEN U, who obviously has a source within LNCOLLAR, also
told IDEN A about many of the individuals (by name) in LNCOLLAR who are
formarly BKHERALD employees.
20. IDEN U's information appears to be accurate, according to IDEN A,
who recalle receiving a telephone call from IDEN G in July 1975. IDEN G
was agitated, and asked IDEN A to handle a matter for him quickly and
quietly. He said his wife, children, and the business agent of IDEN Y
were in Kay West, and were supposed to stay in the apartment of a retired'
BKHERALD employee named IDEN Z (formerly with IDEN AA). IDEN Z, a friend
of IDEN F, had left the area and gave his apartment, key to IDEN F. When
IDEN C's wife and the others arrived in Key West, theyccould not locate
IDEN F to get the koy. IDEN C asked IDEN A to find out what they were
doing, "and just how far my neck is stuck out". IDEN A learned they had
checked into a local motel. He called IDEM G and passed on this information.
IDEN G was relieved, but asked IDEM A to keep an eye on them and report
their movements to him. Subsequently, while on a trip to Miami, IDEN A
was approached by an LNCOLLAR officer in Internal Affairs. This individual
said the episode was under active investigation, and asked IDEN A what
he knew noout it.
21. Finally, IDEN A is giving EXHERALD an opportunity to provide
whatever advice, guidance, and assistance it wishes to furnish before
he takes further action to obtain just compensation from LNCOLLAR. He
is thinking in terms of possible BKKERALD intervention on his behalf
with LNCOLLAR. He recognizes AKAZRALD may wish to let him fend for
himself. In that event, he plans to approach IDEN BB in Tampa to reveal
the above story, and seak IDEN BB's assistance in petitioning LNCOLLAR
fof financial relief. He will not take any action with IDEN BB until
he has heard from BEKHERALD. Since be is anxious to get started on
this matter, a speedy reply to his request for assistance will de
appreciated.
22. IDEN A, incidentally, has docided to remain in Tampa, and has
obtained a job as chief investigator for a local private security
service. We indicated a reply would be forthcoming either through us
or directly to IDEN A. His phone number is IDEN A. He resides at IDEN A.

Publication of Items Relating to Cuban Operations
NPL-003-76
13 January 1976
19449/1
1. We met with Greyston Lynch, a retired Agency staff employee,
on 7 January 1976 at his home in Tampa, Florida. Lynch had requested
the meeting through contact with OGC. One item of interest to Lynch
concerns a book he wishes to write on Cuban operations during the
period 1961-67. Lynch currently is in the process of preparing one
book (on tha Bay of Pigs) for publication. Recently, however, ha
spoke with George Crile, who is writing a book on Watergate burglars
Eugenio Martines and Bernard Barker. Crile indicated he and co-author
Taylor Branch plan to follow that book with one on the Agency'a Cubaa
operations, and focus on Lynch and William Robertson, two major figures
in the Bay of Piga invasion. Since Hartinez was deeply involved with
Lynch as a ship captain during the Bay of Pigs and in subsequent
operations against Cuba, he will be the primary source for the book.
2. Lynch believes the story Martinex will provide will be somewhat
Inaccurate becausa ba only saw developments from the vantage point of
a ship captain. Lyach (whose cohort Robertson is deceased) believes
only ha cau provide an accurate recounting. The Martinez book is
scheduled for printing in the summer of 1976. Lynch would like to
beat Crile and Branch to the punch. Indeed, he believes they will not
publish their book if they know he is going to publish one on the same
subject. What Lynch wishes is an indication of ganeral Agency reaction
to any wamiscript he might write on the period.
3. Lynch wishes to write about the operations of the ANLILAC
group (Commandos Mombisei) during the period 1961-67, when Lyoch
conducted about 100 infiltration and exfiltration operations in Cuba.
Any smscript he drafts will, of course, be submitted to the Agency
for review. He does not wish to get into the writing job, however,
if there is a blanket prohibition on describing Agency operations
which occurred in that period and place. He notes that Martinez, not
fettered Ly Agency restrictions, will provide Crile and Branch with
his recollections. Lynch believes he can cover the material in a way
which will not hurt anyone or expose anything. He had no intentions
of getting into the commando raid recounting business until he heard
from Crile recently.
