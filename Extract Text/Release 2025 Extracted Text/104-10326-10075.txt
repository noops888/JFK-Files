REGARDING EMBASSY SECURITY, OUR CONCERN IS THAT WITHOUT A 24 HOUR
PRESENCE WE DO NOT HAVE AN EFFECTIVE DETERRENT TO SURREPTITIOUS
ENTRY. ELECTRONIC SECURITY DEVICES WILL ONLY TELL US THAT AN
SECURITY AT

EMBASSY MINSK WAS RECENTLY DISCUSSED BY CE OFFICERS WITH THE SSCI,
THE FACT, OF
WHO HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR CONCERN TO THE DEPARTMENT.
COURSE, IS THAT STATE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO
HAVE MARINE GUARDS AT ALL LOCK AND LEAVE EMBASSIES AND NWBOLTON
APPRECIATES THAT. (FYI: THIS IS A PARTICULARLY CONTENTIOUS ISSUE
WITH THE AMBASSADOR. WE SEE NO POINT IN ALIENATING_HIM BY PUTTING
