Internal Security - R
:
1. Reference is made to previous correspondence from this
office regarding the Bubject and to your file number 105-93295.
2. an official French liaison source reported in early
September 1961 that Antin HYCZPORUE received a letter with the
return address: (fru) DIALNAWSKY, 63/H. 7 84. (sic) Philadelphia
23, Pa. The address was also received from an official U.S.
source as 13/8 7 SA. but this is believed to be a typographical
error. It has not been possible to verify the address as the
envelope vsa not photographed but was passed routinely from the
post office to HYCZFORUK. The letter was not tested for secret
writing.
3. The files of this Agency contain no identifiable information
on DIALNAWSKY. It is possible the address should be 631 Horth
Seventh Street, Philadelphia, which is the one used by POHORILIN.
According to information from your Bureau, this is the home of
Dymto WASTLASZUK, Secretary of the Ukrainian Workingmen's
Association and the residence may be used for meetings of that
organization.
4. We would appresiate any information in your files on
DIALNAWSKY..

1. The IRO files, we understand, have been moved to Germany
(International Tracing Service) or are in the process of moving.
This makes such a check inadvisable, if not impossible.
2.
A GREFPIGY-1 check would not be objectionable even though
he, in turn, makes a police check.

verresentatives of the il Laboratory have been revival aly
briefed on the CE CEST which we believed had been used vion
working on the CILd letter and which catablished the presence
of S on the inttar.
2. We have now been nåvised by a field representative that a
nodified version of this process was actually used and it is poesible
hat the sa is detectable by this version of the cost, but not by the
regular test of which your Hureau has the stelis.
3. It should be noted that our work on korm systers revealed
two cases exhibiting the same type of fiveting detection as was noted
on the 2022lil letter. This, of course, coas not mean that the
Punch latar is written in one of these systems, but corely that
fleeting detections can cosasionally be expected with this variation
of the COME TEST.
L. Agency headquarters laboratory has not completed a compari
son of the original and modified EFVE procehres so as to confira
the finding of our field laboratory that the modified test is EOPS
somitive. It is being provided to your iureau at this time, however,
sincs it is a technique which has been used successfully in a current
