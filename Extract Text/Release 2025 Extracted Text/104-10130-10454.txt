2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
SECRET
MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Wackenhut Corporation
SF493 364
28 July 1975
1. The files on George R. Wackenhut (SF254 530) and
his company, Wackenhut Corporation, were opened in May of
1960. Agency interest in Mr. Wackenhut and his company was
for the purpose of obtaining cover support for Western
Hemisphere Agency employees assigned to Florida.
2. Mr. Wackenhut, a former Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation agent, was investigated by this Agency with favorable
results, and a Covert Security Approval for his use was
granted on 21 November 1961. Subsequently, his company
provided cover backstopping to Western Hemisphere employees
stationed in the Miami, Florida, area.
3. In April of 1967 due to the notoriety that
Mr. Wackenhut had received in connection with his activities
in Florida, Mr. Wackenhut's Covert Security Approval was
rescinded and this Agency severed our relations with him.
However, in November of 1974 it was learned that Wackenhut
Corporation was providing guard coverage to Global Marine
Development, Incorporated (GMDI), Los Angeles, California,
a firm that the Agency office of DDS&T was dealing with.
This Agency made no attempt to persuade GMDI to terminate
their contract with Wackenhut Corporation, and it is assumed
that GMDI is still receiving guard coverage from them.
