1. The September Progress Report for AMSPELL, including
AMHINT and AMDARB activities, is transmitted herewith:
A. ANSPELL
1) General:
a. On 21 September 1962, AMHINT-53 exfiltrated
PBRUMEN in a refugee vessel and made his preliminary operational
report on release from CAC on 22 September (Reference B). Subject
was accompanied by the National Coordinator for Agricultural Affairs
(actually an organizer for guerrilla warfare and resistance groups
throughout the Island) Jose Angel LOZANO y Lozano. Briefly,
AMHINT (53) and LOZANO rendered an optimistic operational report on

AMSPELL organization in PBRUMEN, including the situation in the
underground, compartmentation, organization, communications con-
trol and intelligence structure. Subjects are undergoing intell-
igence debriefing on a continuing basis.
b. While AMHINT 53 was arranging his exfiltration and
ANSPELL Psywar operations in PBRUMEN and the hemisphere were
continued on their normal course, the AMHINTS were still smarting
from the ODYOKE confiscation of their vessel, the JUANIN I, as a
consequence of the 24 August attack on Havana. AMHINT[2] went to Ol
Caracas on 7 September for a meeting with President BETANCOURT (or
his official representative) and a press conference where he
released an ANSPELL statement, which in effect, served a notice on
PBRUMEN and the USSR that any Communist shipping encountered in
PBRUMEN territorial waters will be attacked on sight. (Reference
F and G)
c. Behind the scenes, however, AMHINTF2 was report-
edly (Reference D and E) negotiating with Venezuelan Naval Officials
for surfacecraft and possibly a base from which to operate.
What
success he achieved in this quest, or to what extent President
BETANCOURT is prepared to help AMSPELL, is still an unknown
quantity. Judging from their attempts to raise funds in other
spheres, allegedly for the purchase of a replacement vessel, they
were not very successful in Caracas. (A PU Case Officer handling
the CEDAR team has reported that one of the members complained
of forfeiting a 20-percent "kick-back" in his AMSPELL salary.
(For a breakdown of AMSPELL salary see Attachment B.)
d. AMHINT-2 returned from Caracas and as to be
expected, gave no indication of the "secret negotiations" or their
outcome. On 27 September, along with AMHINT-5, he requested a
meeting with the JMWAVE officer för discussion of the AMBARB
funding disagreement and the general ANSPELL situation (See
Attachment C). Perhaps this session gave JHWAVE a bit more insight
as to AMSPELL plans and intentions, but no real solution for the
AMBARBS resulted. In short, AMSPELL policy is to mold PBPRIME,
public opinion and bring pressure to bear on ODYOKE and GPIDEAL
for action in the PBRUMEN situation within the next four months.
e. To implement such a policy, AMSPELL has exploited
the impact of their 24 August attack on PBPRIME news media, as
well as their Caracas Declaration. Also, they have published a
weekly news letter in English entitled "The Cuban Report" (Refer-
ence C) and about 1,000 copies are mailed out to ODYOKE officials
and congressmen. Initiated in late August, the main theme of this
publication has been the Soviet/Bloc materiel buildup in PBRUMEN.

3) Intelligence Production:
UFG-1572 - "Status of Equipment at the Nico Lopez
Refinery & UK, Czech, and Soviet Assistance
in its maintenance; Shipment of Gold Bullion
from the Refinery to the USSR."
UFG-1585 - (As above)
UFG-1607 - (As above)
UFG-1622 - (As above)
UFG-1628 - (As above)
4) Development and Plans:
All planning phases of AMSPELL activities supported by
JMWAVE at the present time are subject to the results of meetings
with AMSPELL concerning increased control, and, the decisions of
JMWAVE to continue a support relationship if an acceptable degree
of KUBARK control can be established.
B. AMHINTS:
1) General:
a. As reported in Reference B, the most important
AMHINT development during September was the exfiltration of
AMHINT 53:01 This was also significant for JMWAVE, since all nego-
tiations with AMSPELL would be transferred from AMHINT 2 to 01
AMHINT-5301 Although AMHINT-53 Will undoubtedly be fully briefed
and re-Indoctrinated by AMHINT leaders concerning AMSPELL present
status and operational relationship with JMWAVE, AMHINT-53 is a
mature and astute leader and can be expected to appreciate the
broad scope of JMWAVE-AMSPELL operations.
b. In the Psywar field, the AMHINTS in PBRUMEN
continue to produce. "Trinchera" on a hand-operated mimeograph
machine in Havana and distribute about 10,000 copies monthly.
They are also committed to the collection and transmission of
reports and photographs on the Soviet buildup, at least until
the DAMSON intelligence operations are begun. This activity
is in direct support of the AMSPELL policy cited in Paragraph A.1)e
above. The AMSPELL propaganda section is divided into four
departments to carry out this program: PBRUNEN, Latin American,
PBRUMEN Exile Community and PBPRIME.
c. Diplomatic pouches intercepted for JMWAVE by
AMBLEAK-1 have revealed much of AMSPELL operational planning not
heretofore reported. In a series of letters written by the AMSPELL
national coordinators in exile to their opposite numbers in
PBRUMEN on 20 September, it was indicated that:
1. Negotiations by AMHINT 2 in Caracas, Costa Rica
and Panama are practically completed for an
AMSPELL operations base. (Letter from Bernabe
PENE to AMHINT-40)
11. AMSPELL has levied intelligence requirements on
AMHINTS in PBRUMEN for sending out information
on PBRUMEN ports that can be attacked from the
sea. (Intelligence Plans Numbers 5, 6 and 7, in
a letter from AMHINT-39 to "Jesus", National
Coordinator for Intelligence.)
iii. In the interim, reports on Mariel, Cabanas, Bahia
Honda, La Habana, Matanzas and Cardenas are re-
quested on a continuing basis.

d. Subsequently, in an incoming pouch and probably
crossing with the foregoing communications, a series of letters
from the National Coordinators in PBRUNEN reported a severe blow
to AMSPELL clandestine organization. Jore MEDINA Bringier
("Mongo"), National Coordinator for Military Reception and Supply,
reported that AMHINT 100 (PBRUMEN National Coordinator) had been
missing. (Later reported as arrested and being held at G-2
Headquarters on Ave 5 in Miramar.) Also, "Juan" and "Miguel"
were arrested in Havana. Several others were missing. MEDINA
went on to describe security measures implemented and report on
a re-organization of the National Coordinator Committee. He
closed with a plea for a small shipment of small arms for defensive
use, clothing and medicine, and a full-scale propaganda effort if
AMHINT-40 should be sentenced to summary execution.
e. In this same pouch, the National Coordinator for
Propaganda, Nicolas PEREZ Diez-Arguelles ("Jose Alfredo") rendered
a detailed report on Agit/Prop assets in PBRUMEN. The printing and
distribution of "Trinchera" has been moved up to every fortnight,
and efforts to get It printed on a commercial printing press in
Havana appear to be successful. Regular couriers are being trained
for delivery of the newspaper to the provinces. PEREZ alão
reported their progress in mounting two clandestine radio trans-
mitters for Agit/Prop purposes, one in Las Villas and one in
Havana. These are powered by 110 volt generators usually found
on a small farm. It is projected to transmit a regular propram,
probably entitled "Tele-periodico Trinchera". The report does
not explain what counter measures will be taken to prevent GOC
detection. Finally, PEREZ describes an Agit/Prop program already
in progress: Firss a plan for printing and marking walls with
their organization abbreviation, carried out in one operation,
synchronizing municipal and borough teams for the job. As a
follow-up phase, large cloth banners bearing the same letters will
be raised or tended in congested areas and photographs taken for
publication in "Trinchera". Also, with the aid of their Intelli-
gence Section, AMIHINTs have penetrated two radio stations in
Havana and are identifying all Sov/Bloc personnel employed there,
their security practices, addresses and routes for commuting.
2) Total AMHINT Support for September 1962: $5,000.00
(Included in AMSPELL General section of this report)
3) Intelligence Production:
(Reported in AMSPELL General Section.)
4) Development & Plans:
(See this section under AMSPELL General of this report)
C. AMBARB
During the reporting period no changes occurred in AMBARB
personnel assignments. With the exfiltration of AMHINT-53) from
PBRUMEN it is hoped that it will be possible to negotiate with
AMBARB the still unsettled question of AMBARB funding. We will
report further to Headquarters as soon as an agreement is reached
with AMBARB on funding of AMBARB representatives in the field by
local KUBARK Stations. For the present it can only be said that
the AMBARB leaders are strenuously resisting any effort by JMWAVE
to increase to more than eight the number of their people whom
they will permit KUBARK to furd.directly rather than through AMBARB
Headquarters in Miami.
The inspection tour of AMBARB-16 to delegations in
Latin America resulted in the general report forwarded for your

for reference purposes to examin Attachment E a report which the

4) Development and Plans:
All planning phases of AMSPELL activities supported by
JMWAVE at the present time are subject to the results of meetings
with AMSPELL concerning increased control, and, the decisions of
JMWAVE to continue a support relationship if an acceptable degree
of KUBARK control can be established.
B. AMHINTS:
1) General:
a. As reported in Reference B, the most important
AMHINT development during September was the exfiltration of
AMHINT 53:01 This was also significant for JMWAVE, since all nego-
tiations with AMSPELL would be transferred from AMHINT 2 to 01
AMHINT-5301 Although AMHINT-53 Will undoubtedly be fully briefed
and re-Indoctrinated by AMHINT leaders concerning AMSPELL present
status and operational relationship with JMWAVE, AMHINT-53 is a
mature and astute leader and can be expected to appreciate the
broad scope of JMWAVE-AMSPELL operations.
b. In the Psywar field, the AMHINTS in PBRUMEN
continue to produce. "Trinchera" on a hand-operated mimeograph
machine in Havana and distribute about 10,000 copies monthly.
They are also committed to the collection and transmission of
reports and photographs on the Soviet buildup, at least until
the DAMSON intelligence operations are begun. This activity
is in direct support of the AMSPELL policy cited in Paragraph A.1)e
above. The AMSPELL propaganda section is divided into four
departments to carry out this program: PBRUNEN, Latin American,
PBRUMEN Exile Community and PBPRIME.
c. Diplomatic pouches intercepted for JMWAVE by
AMBLEAK-1 have revealed much of AMSPELL operational planning not
heretofore reported. In a series of letters written by the AMSPELL
national coordinators in exile to their opposite numbers in
PBRUMEN on 20 September, it was indicated that:
이
:
1. Negotiations by AMHINT 2 in Caracas, Costa Rica
and Panama are practically completed for an
AMSPELL operations base. (Letter from Bernabe
PENE to AMHINT-40)
11. AMSPELL has levied intelligence requirements on
AMHINTS in PBRUMEN for sending out information
on PBRUMEN ports that can be attacked from the
sea. (Intelligence Plans Numbers 5, 6 and 7, in
a letter from AMHINT-39 to "Jesus", National
Coordinator for Intelligence.)
iii. In the interim, reports on Mariel, Cabanas, Bahia
Honda, La Habana, Matanzas and Cardenas are re-
quested on a continuing basis.

d. Subsequently, in an incoming pouch and probably
crossing with the foregoing communications, a series of letters
from the National Coordinators in PBRUNEN reported a severe blow
to AMSPELL clandestine organization. Jore MEDINA Bringier
("Mongo"), National Coordinator for Military Reception and Supply,
reported that AMHINT 100 (PBRUMEN National Coordinator) had been
missing. (Later reported as arrested and being held at G-2
