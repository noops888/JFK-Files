SUBJECT
: Case 64574 USSR External Policy - Pugwash Conference
Munich, Germany, August 1977
1. Enclosed you will find a list of attendees (Enclosure A)
to the Pugwash Conference held in Munich, Germany, in August, and
a set of questions (Enclosure B) prepared by the ORPA analysts
at our request. Since the original list of attendees contained
only the last name and first initial of each US participant, we
had to make some educated guesses as to the true identities of
many of them. As a result, do not be surprised if some question
why we felt they had attended. In many cases, however, there was
no question as to the true identity of the source.
2. ORPA has been quite pleased with the reporting generated
by their previous requirements. As a result, they have made an
extra effort to write even more thought-provoking requirements.
We feel that the enclosed questions are the best we have sent out
to date.
3. Responsive reporting should cite the current CISL, Objective
Ala and KIQ 90. We look forward to receiving your responses.

The Aaron E. Norman Fund, Inc., New York, New York
Purposes and Activities: Interests include the improvement
of inter-cultural and inter-racial relations; the protection of civil
liberties; the prevention and treatment of emotional disturbances, etc.
Norman Fund channeled the following amounts of CIA money to
CIA projects:
1961
$15,000 to American Society for African Culture
(AMSAC)
1962 $10,000 to African-American Institute (AAI)
1963
$15,000 to Pan American Foundation (PAF). (This repre-
sented a part of the total budget for PAF in 1963. Vir-
tually all PAF funds in 1963 were used for grants to in-
dividual recipients of Agency operational interest. No
domestic organizations received any of the funds.)
1964 $10,000 to International Development Foundation (IDF)
Norman Fund gave its own money to the following CIA projects:
1962 $7,500 to American Society for African Culture (AMSAC)
1962 $3,000 to African Research Foundation
1962 $3,100 to U.S. National Student Association (USNSA)
We hold copies of Schedule of Ordinary Grants of the Norman Fund
for 1962 and 1963. These documents confirm the figures and the recipients
cited in the Drew Pearson column. No CIA funds were given for other than
the four grants listed above.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations
SUBJECT
: Alleged CIA use of the Formosa Foundation and the J. K.
Norman Fund, Inc. to Pass Funds to Organizations Involved
in, e.g., Leo Cherne
REFERENCE
: New York Times Article of February 19, 1976 by Jay
Crevison, Case Subject
1. Reference reports that the President of the Formosa Foundation,
Mr. Frank Weil, said that he was approached by a "mysterious gentleman"
from CIA in 1964 and asked to pass about $15,000 in Government
funds to the International Rescue Committee of which Leo Cherne
was then Chairman. CIA files reveal that the Formosa Foundation
(formerly the Aaron E. Norman Fund, Inc.) was never used to pass CIA funds
to the International Rescue Committee as implied in Reference. Attached is
the record of CIA funds passed through the A. E. Norman Fund, Inc. and
bona fide grants made by the Fund to CIA projects. It is noted that in
1961, the Norman Fund passed $15,000 of CIA funds to the American Society
for African Culture (ASAC). Possibly, Mr. Weil confused this funding for
African activities with the International Rescue Committee.
2. It is true as reported in the article and sourced to an executive
of the J. K. Norman Fund, Inc. that the fund supported a single Agency pro-
gram in the item. That program was the Institute of International Labor
Research, Inc. (IILR), a non-profit organization active in the Latin
American labor field. CIA's use of the J. K. Norman Fund, Inc.
to fund the IILR persisted in 1964 when use of the Norman Fund was exposed
in Congressional hearings of the House Committee on Tax-exempt Foundations.
CIA files confirm that the J. K. Norman Fund, Inc. made in 1963 a bona fide
grant to the International Rescue Committee for Czech refugee relief. There is
no evidence that CIA funds were passed to the Norman
Fund for any purpose except support of the IILR.
3. Although there is no evidence that CIA ever directly or indirectly
funded the International Rescue Committee or Freedom House,
Mr. Cherne personally and through his firm, Research Institute of America,
Inc., actively assisted the Agency in the past as a DCI agent, Joel A.

SHALLOWAY (P) currently in Paris was provided cover in Paris, France
from 1954-1955 by the Research Institute of America, Inc. During
operations against Cuba in 1959-60 Mr. Cherne was active in both an
FI and CIA capacity. He was also subsequently a DCD source.

JFK MICROFILM FILE SUMMARY
SUMMARY: REEL 4, FOLDER(S) 3, CREATED 02/07/94 by ES
SUBJECT OF FOLDER: Abram Chayes
201 NUMBER, IF ANY
INCLUSIVE DATES OF FILE MATERIAL: Undated THRU APRIL 1978
RELEVANCE OR NON-RELEVANCE TO OSWALD & JFK ASSASSINATION:
Neither the information or time frame is relevant. See Summary below.
REASON OR ASSUMED REASON FOR INCLUSION IN THIS COLLECTION:
A review of the HSCA volumes did not surface an "Abram" Chayes but an "Abraham" Chayes, a legal
advisor to the State Department, who maintained that at the time Oswald received his visa to enter Russia
from the Soviet Embassy in Helsinki, normally at least 1 week would elapse between the time of a tourist's
application and the issuance of a visa. It would appear that Abram and Abraham are not identical to each
other. Betty Lichtenfeld of the HSCA reviewed the file on 17 August 1978.
SUMMARY OF INFORMATION WITHIN FILE:
Harvard Law School professor who attended a Pugwash Conference in Munich in 1977.
CIA/U. S. GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIP:
None.
