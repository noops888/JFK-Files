Talked to Jim Lollis, Deputy Chief
Ground Photo Services Branch, in the absence
of Harry Van Tuyl. There is no photo of
the "bums in police custody at the scene
of the assassination" without a credit
at the bottom of the photo. It cannot be obtained
from the wire service directly.
Mr. Collis called Herb Simmons, CRS
Document Services Group could arrange for
our man in New York (who has State color)
to put in a request to Newsweek. Mr.
Simmons said he could not make a
request for a domestic photo without the
authorization of Dr. Proctor, but even w/
authorization he does not recommend
this route, as there is no plausible
reason for a "State" person to be
requesting this photo. 24
