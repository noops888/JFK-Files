NOTE: This letter is classified "Seerat" because it
contains information so classified by CIA(Cu
CIA seeks to pass a summary of information concerning
subject withe BfV in Germany and has requested permission to (5)
include the following in this summary stating it comes from our
files:
"During his New York City tenure, he was known to
write bank drafts to persons known to be active Communist
workers. It was suggested that he was used as a means of
financing Communist Party activities. "(4)
CIA stated above conclusion "was apparently based on
numerous Bureau reports written during 1957 and 1958." CIA
refers specifically to only one bank draft, it having been
written by subject Alicia Merino Fuentes and states that our(s)
report dated 10/12/56-contained information that she was an
active communist. This report was in the case on/Merino Fuentess
and the only allegation that she was an active communist was the
1941 allegation made to the Embassy in Mexico. Burau has
developed no information indicating payees of other bank drafts,
written by subject had subversive associations or sympathies.
