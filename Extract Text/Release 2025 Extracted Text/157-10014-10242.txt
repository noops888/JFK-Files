SECRETS OF THE CIA!!!
American Mata Hari Who Duped Castro
Marie Lorenz: spied on Fidel.
Its clandestine operations now under-
going a sometimes painful official
scrutiny, the Central Intelligence
Agency maintains, as always, a tight lip. But
from interviews with the agents who
redout to do the CIA's clock-and-dagger
work, News reporter Paul Meskil tells
here for the first time of the intrigue
that surfaced in the Cuban missile crisis,
a confrontation that pushed the US
to the brink of war with the Soviet Union. First of a series.

"Yes. I'm with the American

SUNDAY NEWS, JUNE 185 1976
CIA Sent Bedmate
To Kill Castro in '60
By PAUL MESKIL
The Central Intelligence Agency sent a shapely Mata Hari to Cuba in
1960 to kill her former lover, Fidel Castro.
Details of this case were uncovered by The News and a Senate Intelligenes
Committee investigator who
learned that a mystery
woman had been involved
in an assassination plot
against the Cuban dictator.
It was
the first of several
CLA-sponsored attempts to exe-
cute Castro.
The mystery woman has now
been identified by the committee
and The News as Marie Lorenz,
attractive German-American
brunette who shared Castro's
Havana hotel suite for several
months in 1959. When a commit-
tee investigator confronted her
with evidence linking her to the
assassination plot, she admitted
that she had been recruited for
the attempted hit.
Exclusive Account
Then, last week, she gave this
reporter an exclusive account of
a mission so secret that she
never mentioned it to anyone for
11 years.
Ms. Lorenz, who now lives in
New York, is the daughter of
the late German Navy Capt.
Heinrich Lorenz and his Ameri-
can wife. After World War II,
Lorenz became skipper of the
luxury liner Berlin. He took
Marie along on a Caribbean
cruise in May 1959.
A month after the Cuban
revolution, the Berlin was in
Havana harbor and dined with
the captain and his vivacious
teenage daughter. He later per-
suaded Maric to return to Hava-
na to work as his personal inter-
preter. When she arrived she
was installed in Castro's 24th-
floor suite at the Havana Hilton.
She soon realized she was a
virtual prisoner.
Quizzed by FBI
Frank Fiorini, an American
who had become a Cuban Revo-
lutionary Army officer and a
CIA agent, contacted her and
persuaded her to photograph
Castro's secret papers. He later
helped her escape.
She left Havana in January
NW 50955 DocId; 32423630 Page, 5.
The Memo That Started It
On Dec. 11, 1959, Col. J. C. King, head of the CIA's
Western Hemisphere Division, wrote a memorandum to
Director Allen Dulles, according to a Senate commit-
tee report. Noting that the "far left" regime in Cuba
could encourage other Latin American countries
against US interests, he recommended that:
"consideration be given to the elimination of Fidel Castro.
None of the close to Fidel, such as his brother Raol
or companion, Che Guevara, have the same mesmeri appeal to
the masses. Many informed people believe that the disappear-
ance of Fidel would greatly accelerate a fall of the present
government.
Thomas Dulles and Deputy Director of Plans Richard B.
Helms approved the recommendation, and the CIA launched an
assassination campaign against Castro that lasted at least
five years. This is the exclusive story of the first try.

To Kill Castro in '60

gave her two capsules
full of poison powder. She was
York and told to sprinkle the powder in
Hospital for Castro's coffee.
"I guess the company (CIA)
supplied them. Frank said it was
a Cuba company operation."
Packing the olive-drab uni-
form that Castro had given her,
designating her as a lieutenant in the
Cuban Revolutionary Army, Ms.
Lorenz flew back to Havana on
Cubana Airlines. Believing she
might be searched at the airport,
she hid the capsules in a jar of
cold cream in her purse. When she
arrived in Havana she checked into
a tourist hotel, changed into her
Fidelista uniform and went to the
Hilton.
Cold-Cream Caper
"The lobby was full of report-
ers and other people trying to see
Castro, but he wasn't there.
One of his aides recognized me
and took me up to Fidel's suite.
Entering the two-room suite, she
saw that nothing had changed in
her absence. The sitting
room was crowded with Castro's
bearded, pistol-packing retain-
ers. The bedroom was littered
with papers, cigar butts and
guns.
She waited nervously in Cas-
tro's private room until he came
in a few hours later. As soon as
he smiled and hugged her, she
knew he didn't suspect she had
visited the suite a few months
previously and stolen his secrets.
And he certainly didn't suspect
she had come back to kill him.
Do Not Disturb
"He asked why I left him and
I said it was because I missed
my mother and my home. He
started talking about Cuba and
the problems, the lack of money,
the shortages. He talked a long
time. He said he was expecting
an important phone call, but he
took the receiver off the hook
and he shouted to the barbudos
(bearded ones) in the next
room: 'No me moleste (Don't
bother me)'
"Finally he ordered food and
coffee sent up. When it came, he
fell asleep on the bed, in his
fatigues and with a cigar in his
mouth. I had no confidence left,
but I knew this was the chance
to do it.
"I went into the bathroom and
opened the jar of cold cream. I
stuck my finger in it and the
whole thing came out like yuck.
I couldn't find the capsules.
They had melted.
"It was like an omen.
"I couldn't just dump a glob
of cold cream in his coffee, so I
shut the jar and went back to
the bedroom and I watched him
sleeping. Finally I lay down on
the bed beside him.
"I thought, 'To hell with it.
Let history take its course.'
"Stupid, Stupid"
Frank and Alex met me when I
flew to Miami next morning.
They asked me what happened
thousands, and I said the capsules melted.
Frank was very upset. He said,
'Stupid, stupid, stupid. Why did
you put them in the cold cream?'
I said, 'Where else? It was the
only place to think of where no
one would find them.""

Aria Floors
Opera Singer
London, June 12 (UPI)
Dn Giovanni reached for a
high note at the Royal Opera
House in London last night
and fell through the floor.
He stuck there, in the per-
sou of singer Ruggero Rai-
mondi, trapped to his waist
and singing for dear life. Sir
Geraint Evans and his other
co-performers, still singing,
tagged and pulled. Eventual-
ly Raimondi climbed out, un-
hurt but shaken with his word
bent into a curve.
"They
were
magnificent,"
said critic Hilton Tims, who
was in the audience. "They
carried on without letting the
incident upset their vocal
equilibrium."
Ms. Lorenz was not asked to
try again.
"Would you have killed him if
the capsules hadn't melted?" the
interviewer asked. "No," she
replied. "Probably not."
Alex Rorke later disappeared
on a mystery flight to Nicara-
gua. Frank Fiorini, now known
as Frank Sturgis, continued to
perform odd jobs for the CIA
until his arrest in 1972 as one of
the Watergate burglars.
Informed of Ms. Lorenz' ac-
count of the assassination at-
tempt, he verified her story.
Soon after her murder mission
failed, the CIA recruited Mafia
mobsters including John
Roselli of Las Vegas, Sam Gian-
cana of Chicago and Santo Traf-
ficante of Tampa, Fla. - to kill
Castro. But they were no more
successful than the sexy Mata
Hari.

CIA Sent Bedmate
To Kill Castro in '60
By PAUL MESKIL
The Central Intelligence Agency sent a shapely Mata Hari to Cuba in
1960 to kill her former lover, Fidel Castro.
Details of this case were uncovered by The News and a Senate Intelligenes
Committee investigator who
learned that a mystery
woman had been involved
in an assassination plot
against the Cuban dictator.
It was
the first of several
CLA-sponsored attempts to exe-
cute Castro.
The mystery woman has now
been identified by the committee
and The News as Marie Lorenz,
