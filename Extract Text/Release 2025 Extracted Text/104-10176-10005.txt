1. Forwarded as Attachment One under separate cover are seven contact
reports by LIRING-3 on recent developments of the LIRING-3
Operation, dated 27 and 28 July, 1, 3 (two reports), 5 and 9 August 1967
(two reports). One of the reports dated 3 August is a monthly resume of
operational activities for the month of July. It is forwarded together with
the other reports rather than separately to give as complete a picture as
possible of LIRING-3's dealings with Hoises OROZCO Leal, the circumstances
in which the two men met and the reporting of these dealings by LIRING-3
to ROWTON. Forwarded as Attachment Two, also under separate cover, are
photo copies of a two page typewritten message left by OROZCO at LIRING-3's
apartment on 1 August. Another copy of this message is being forwarded
Guatemala City separately.

2. There is little question that LIRING-3 seized the opportunity given
him by the sudden apperition of OROZCO on the scene to cover vis a vis his
wife a few days of misbehaving. Instead of proceeding to Tapachuls to receive
from the FAR new contract instructions in Mexico City (an awkward arrangement
to say the least), LIRING-3 remained at the safe house he uses in the capital
to receive the visit (as indicated by LIFEAT) of Berta WICISSER his "regular"
mistress, Silvia DURAN (of Lee Earvey OSWALD fame) and possibly a certain
Yolanda (who appears for the first time in this operation and whose phone
number is not in the Station reversed Hexico City telephone directory)
Pinned down on the fact that he was in Mexico City during the period of 19
to 21 July, LIRING-3 admitted that he was but felt that he had to tell
another lie rather than admit his misbehavior. This lie was that he did not
want to appear dependant on Sergio VALDEZ in the eyes of ROWTON and so
made his first meeting with OROZCO "more intriguing" by inventing the trip
to Tapachula. To add credence to the Tapachula story, LIRING-3 previously
asked his wife to impress ROWTON with her concern for his, telling ROWTON
that he had disappeared for three days without telling her where he went.
This she did very convincingly with much sobbing and crying. The LIROSIN
LP which continues to experience technical difficulties now and then did not
operate properly that day (it's recorder broke down) but, as luck will have
it LIROSIN live monitored conversation between LIKING-3 and his wife
during which the latter reported that her tears seemed to have convinced
Buntham and on what one had onme retry hint talk with
LIRING-3 coacerned the mention of the alias which ROWTON uses with LIRING-3
and 4 to various persons with whom LIRING-3 is in touch. LIFEAT coverage
had indicated, for example, that LIRDNG-3 mentioned BOSTON in alias to
Sergio VALDEZ. This LIRING-3 denied. He produced on 3 August 1967 a
written review of all the people of interest to ROWTON with whom he has
been in contact indicating whether or not he mentioned ROWTON's alias to
them. This review is attached to one of ROWTON's reports dated 9 August.
3. What happened between OROZCO, LIRING-3, Sergio VALDEZ and Raul
MORENO is explained in detail in ROWTOH's reports forwarded with this
dispatch. A few additional points should probably be made here. First of
all, part of the first meeting between LIRING-3 and ORCZCO at LIRING-3's
safehouse was live monitored by LIROSIN when the latter returned home from
his regular bartending job in the early hours of the morning. LIROSIN
heard enough (his recorder was once more inoperative) to basically confira
LIRING-3's report of his meeting with OROZCO to ROWTON. Secondly, neither
VALDEZ nor MORENO were present during the night of 31 July-1 August when
LIRING-3 told OROZCO that the latter vas in fact a deserter from the FAR,
refusing to indicate how he knew this (ROWTON had passed LIRING-3 information
on OROZCO received by the Station from both LIREBEL-1 and 2). The two men
arrived at LIRING-3's apartment in the early morning hours when OROZCO
had admitted everything and thus do not know what prompted him to tell the
truth. Thirdly, LURING-3 nsists that he told OROZCO nothing about his
plastic flower business and it's contemplated use to cover activities in
support of the Guatemalan rebels. According to him, CROZCO already knew
this as well as other details of his dealings with the FAR. LIRING-3
presumes that OROZCO learned this from the higher-ups of the FAR guerrillas
while in the hills. OROZCO mistakenly apparently thought that LIRING-3 was
in the actual arms procurement business whereas his discussions with the
FAR have been limited up to now to the eventual transportation of FAR
acquired supplies from Northern Mexico to Guatemala (with the FAR assuming
the responsibility of smuggling these supplies over the Guatemalan border).
LIRING-3's plastic flower business designed to cover support activities on
behalf of the FAR, is not, as a matter of fact operative yet. Thus OROZCO
was badly informed of LIRING-3's activities. How OROZCO hoped to obtain arms
from LIRING-3, had the latter been able to deliver some at the Guatemalan
border area, in view of the fact (as he later admitted) that he was stone
broke, is a matter of conjecture. A desperate man may do desperate things
and LIRING-3 could have found himself in serious trouble. Judging from the
FAR's shooting habits it is a good thing in any case that OROZCO was not
armed during the argument at LIRING-3's apartment the sight of 31 July to
1 August, particularly when VALDEZ started to threaten him,

4. This Station believes that the LIRING-3 Operation has reached a
critical point as a result of the OROZCO affair. Both the Cubans and the
FAR (via Ernesto CAPUANO Del Vecchio) have been notified by LIRING-3 of
OROZCO's conduct and statements (a copy of OROZCO's message forwarded as
Attachment Two was given CAPUANO). If the FAR is at all interested in
LIRING-3 he will somehow hear from the Guatemalan guerrillas and negotiations
concerning arms and equipment will be rearmed. LIPING-3 has not heard from
GARCIA since June and does not even know if the latter is in Mexico.
It is the Station's opinion that he probably will hear nothing directly
from the Cubans.
5. Headquarters will note, per ROWTOH's report dated 28 July, the
relative ease with which LIRING-3 claims to be obtaining false passports
and other identity papers. The Cuban's passports that LIRING-3 purchased
in Nuevo Laredo, mentioned in the same report, were issued in 1953 and 1959
and may be of marginal value. They will nevertheless be forwarded to
Headquarters together with other documentation held by the bearers of these
passports.

moviehouse. LIRING/3 stated that he took trip and was approached in lobby
by same xxxxx young Guatemalan woman (with criental features) whos he had
net in Guatemala City during his last trip. This woman simply informed him
that a cozarade would contact him (L/3) as his home in next few days and
disuuss future operations. 0/3 continued that he returned to Mexico

who later stated his true name is Moises Crozco Leal and that he has been
in Mexico past twenty years.
2. At meeting next day in safehouse Crozco informed 1/3 that he ordered by
Montes group to establish contact with 1/3 in order expedite first shipment
of arms and ammo which urgently needed. Then 2/3 mentioned possiblity air-
lift from Jan Cristóbal area through small privately chartered plane, Orozco
intensely interested and acceded to 1/3 request that he first meet with
"responsible high-level" FAR representatives. Crozco stated that in his
opinion 1/3 should discuss whole operation with Kontes himself and volun-
teered to ar ange meeting in near future.

their destination and its presumed that remainder was captured by Guate-
malan army. He added that FÅR needed a doctor urgently for about ten days
and would appreciate L/3 a ranging this if feasible. L/3 suggested to Rowton
that Raúl Moreno, who is in third year of medical studies, might qualify if
Rowton could not come up with fully qualified doctor.

Subject: Wallace S. Roxton Meeting with LIE.0/3.
1. On the corning of 27 July, 1957, the day after his return to Mexico
City, Eoston contacted IIPTG/3 at his home and arranged for a meeting
at the safehouse at 1130 that same morning. 2/3 commented that he was
greatly relieved thet Roston had returned safely since many things hai
happened during his absence and 1/3 had felt uncertain' about what he shoul
do in the event Fouton had been delayed any longer.
2. At the 1130 meeting at the safehouse, LIRING/3 reported that he and
LIRING/4 had accompanied 1/3's half brother in his car to Jabinas, Coat.,
related that inmediately on arrival he had his half-brother introduce him
as planned to the judge in Sueva Rosita, a small village near Sabinas. L/3
reported to Rowton that the judge is med Francisco Mario Valdez Herzández
and is actually a "Juez Kénor" but also a notario publico and an "agente
del Ministério Público", and, as such, has authority to issue important
documents. According to L/3, judge Valdez, who gave the appearance of a
homosexual, spoke openly about his ability and willingness to issue false
documents and arrange for a passport for 1/3 in the alias Alberto Zárate.
Ee promised to take care of the matter for the sum of 2,000 pesos, but ac-
cepted a down payment of 1,300 pesos and gave 1/3 a receipt for this scount
"para el areglo de un pasaporte mexicano", addressed to alberto Zárate Vi-
dal. In addition IRIBG/3's half-brother persuaded the judge to ixx arranng
for the issuance to Alberto Zárate of an identity card showing that. Cérate
was an "actuario" of the Ministry of Labor, and for a driver's license,so
that Zárate would have additional cocuments attesting to his identity.
3. LIRING/3 commented that he was certain that he could arrange for false
papers for Rowton in the event the latter felt he could use such papers.
1/3 continued that he and 1/4 then proceeded to Nuevo Loredo and picked
up the three Cuban passports that his half-brother had purchased on his
behalf for the sum of 500 pesos. L/3 explained that although the persons
to whom the passports were issued were dead they might conceivably be of
use to Rcwton in the future. He added that the hotel clerk who sold the
documents to his half-brother had originally asked 1,500 pesos but appa-
rently was glad to set the 500 when it was offered in cash on the table.
4. LIRING/3 continued that he and L/4 returned to Mexico City on 14 July
taking the bus at Correo/3 then announced Jubilantly that a few
days after his return, while he was visiting the sarehouse in the hope
of Rowton's retum or at lonst a telephone call, bu received a telephone
call from an anonymous man, obviously a Guatemalan, who asked whether he
could make a trip to Parachula in order to meet with a friend. When 1/3
indicated that he could make the trip, the person instructed his to wait
in the lobby of the Figueroa Lovie house until he was approached by the
"friend". LG/3 l Roston that he then proceeded by train to Tapachu-
la (on 19 July) and waited in the lorby as instructed. Co his great sur-
prise, he was approached by the same Guatemalan young woman who had met
hiz in Guatemalacity in late January, 1937, and told that a certain "Valen-
tín" would contact him at his home in Kexico City in the near future and
that this person was to be his new contact with F12. HIRING/3 continued
that co
we tue soie purpose of the trip, he returned
to Mexico City on 21 July in order to await the arrival of "Valentic". ac-
cording to LIRING/3 this sccurred in a rather strange way. hen be returned
home he found a ncte under the door with a brief text stating that some-
one had passed by to see him. The mte was signed with a five-pointed star
rather crudely drawn in the place of a signature. stated that he was
completely puzzled at this, but on reflexion felt that the five-pointed
star seant 1700 and he therefore went to the safetouse at 1700 that day
to avait further contact. According to 1/3, a person did telephone him
shortly after he arrived and identfied himself as "Valentín: He asked L/3
to avait another call at 1030 the following day so that a meeting could be
arranged. 1/3 continued that he finally succeeded in zesting with "Valentin
and brought his to the safehouse on the evening of 25 July. He stated that
he talked with this person until 0400 the following morning.
5. CIRING/3 reported that "Valentin", who identified hisself by true name
as Koisés Crozco Leal, Calle Tenfis 88, Apt 5, Zcaa 21, Country Club, Col.
Churutusco, Mexico City, D.F. Orozco stated to 1/3 that he had been in Me-
xico soze twenty years and had been engaged in propaganda work for the FAR.
Ee added that recently he had received instructions to contact 1/3 and talk
with him "very frankly" concerning the procurement problem. He explained
to 1/3 that Far had had very disappointing experiences in the past and was
in desperate need of secure and efficient channels for the procurezent of
aras and ammunition from the C.3. and Mexico. He stated that FAR had the
cash necessary to purchase the arms and hoped that Mas/3's commercial
netweork could handle the procurement and transport. Ee indicated to L/3
that FÅR had checked hiz out with favorable results both locally and with
the Cubans. In the course of conversation "Valentín" mentioned that Coc-
tora Hercedes Fereira, whom 2/3 had met in "avara, was currently in Hexi-
co. "Valentín" states that it was a very critical tize for PAR and that
everyone hoped that something would be rsolved in Havana with regard to
concrete aid from the Cubans. Za indicated that in the past both the Cubans
and the Soviets had done more talking that producing in both material and
hard cash. In speaking of the cost inmediate needs, "Valectic" stated that
FAR needed a focutor argently to train the revolutionaries in first aid,
and he asked 1/3 whether he could recommend a doctor that might be willing
to visit FAR headquarters for about ten days for this purpose. 1/3 told
Eowton that he rozised to look into the latter sconest, alling that he had
in mind his friend Rail Horeno Conchee, who was a zedical student and pro-
bably qualified to give first aid instruction.
5. LIRING/3 continued that he expressed his ٠٩١٦٩٠٠٠٠
arns procurement effort, but would prefer to be able to talk iirectly with
FAR leaders to get first-hand information as to their needs, and arrange
secure methods of payment. Then 1/3 referred to the delinquent account
(medicine and radio tubes) Walerin" relpied that unfortunately only part
of the medicine had arrived intact, the other part presumedly having been
captured by the Guatemalan aray. He promised that 1/3 would be paid fr
for the material furnished and apologized for not having the money with his
he added that he receives com financial assistence from FAR and has to live
as best he can from his own resources. In reply to 13's query, "Valentín"
stated that he did not personally know "Garcia", since Far insisted on com-
partmentation, and there had been no need for hin to meet "Carcia" in the
past. He then lectured 1/3 or security, stating that FAR principal :ro-
blem to date had been within the organization itself result = from laxness
on the part of revcluticmarinis and outright betrayal by some members.
added that LIRING/3 had been assigned the battle-name "Rafael" and that
henceforth he should use that name whenever dealing with FAR members.
6. LIRING/3 told Routen that, in the course of conversation regarding possib-
le supply channels, ta mentioned the possibility of air-drops from scall
privately chertered planes, using the Raúl Moreno as a pilot. According to
1/3, "Valentin" showed immediate interest in this, commenting that he was
certain FAR would be most interested. He then stated that he felt 1/3 was
an important enough asset to meet directly with César Kontes tiaself and
he promised to look into the possibility of arranging a personal interview.
1/3 replied that he would welcome this opportunity since it would clarify
the entire picture for his and enable is to render the most efficient
service to FAR. "Valentin" promised to have some specific word on this
at their next Lectin bien he requested for 1222 28 July, promising
to come to 1/3's home between 1500 and 1700. "Valentin" explained that
although the safehouseppeared to be an excellent meeting place, it was
Faz policy not to use the same apartment or place of meeting more than
cace.
7. Rowton net with/3 again at 1430 cn 29 July, 1967, at the safetruse
The second zeeting had been scheduled for 1900 on 22 July, but on arrival
at hte safehouse, Roxton found a acte from 1/3 stating that he would not
be able to make the 1900 nesting but would see Rowton at 1430 the follow-
ing day. The naly explanation in the note for the delay was "cosas muy
importantes han sucedido". when Boston met with TOTU12 than
1430, the latter explained that "Valentín" had left a note at his home
saying the meeting would be delayed, and then appeared unannounced when
1/3 was not at home and talked briefly with LIRING/A. 1/3 stated that he
alarmed DIRING/4 by stating that he ("Valentín") had a wounded man that
must be taken care of urgently and asked 1/4 to pass on the message to 13
xix the hope that 1/2 could look into the possbility of locating a good
trusted doctor. "Valentin" pr zised to come back to the ouse as soon as
he could. According to 1/3, "Valentin" reappeared uzannounced at about
1CCO on 29 July, and showed 1/3 a telegram which he had just received frבנ
Guatemala City. The telegran contained the text
you are interested
in further details ccccerning the business, present yourself here", and
was addressed to "Valentin" in his true zaze and address. 1/3 stated that
he could not recall the sender's aane or address but he assumed that it
would be an alias in any case.
8. According to L/3, "Valentin" explained to him that the telegram neant.
that a meeting with Cesar Montes could be arranged and that L/3 should ac-
cordingly prepare himself for the trip. In reply to 1/3's query, "Valen-
tha" stated that this took priority over the operation involving the woun
ded conrade, who was expected in Xexico City in about 7-8 days. "Valentia
then stated that he and 1/3 would have to make a trip to Tapachula as scca
as feasible and in order to receive from a FAR cent et a sealed envelope
containing the name of the first contact in Guatemala City. He added that
he himself would not know what was in the envelope and would himself pro-
ceed on into Guatemala with the Fan contact who delivered the letter. Ee
added that 1/3 would then have to return to Mexico City and fly into Guate-
mala City under commercial cover, since it would be too dangerous to
proceed on to Guatemala City from "apach-ls by air ( the affert being
small and all travelers being subject to the curiosity and beutiay of
the local officials). Toltectin then stated that 1/3 should be ale to
pass through the Bustezala City airport ithout difficulty provided he
kept his eye out for a certain José, an ex-Chief of Folice who
worked for the North-zerican Embassy had a splete fe on all sus-
pect persons who Light enter or leave the import. "Valentin" described
Linares as a man of short stature, thin, rey hair coated in a bhigh pesir
in front, usually fressed in a doble-brested Jocket. "Valeza" aided that
Linares was considered the most dangerous aan et the airport, altho-gh he
is not an offici but simply a cecret agent of the North Aericans.
9. "Valentin" then, according to 1/3, stated that the latter should pצרכי
Central de a chce so that as could or then to zapaccale v
hin:
1) Chaki shirt and trousers (pantalón y carisa de lona muy cruescs)
2) Leather ecotat boots (zapatos de campaña)
3) Erowning or alter automatic weapon with 3 clips and 50
rounds of anmunition.
4) Detonators with wick or electric fuse
5) Gauze for medicci treatment
6) Chree pills of cost potent roison avicliable.
"Valentin" explained that the Corwning actometic was the best since it
could be converted easily into a machinegun with its clip : 13 cart-
ridges. The Halter was also good since it could be fitted with a silencer.
"Valentín" also explained that the pois capsules were desirable to be
taken in the event of capture by the army to avoid the possibility of -
one confessing under torutare. He added that one was for the use of L
and the other two for the courades who would be his escorts.
10. "Valentín" further explained that should open the sealed envelope
he had received in Tapachula when he was aboard the plane enroute to Cua-
temala City, memoriz: the name and address and then destroy the paper. Ee
added quickly that he realized 1/3 could open the envelope any time after
he received it in Capachula, and he was free to do so, but it was hoped
for security reasons that he would open it caly after he had left Kexico
City airport. "Valentin" added that he self had no idea of shat nane
would appear on the paper, but in any case he was sure that it would be
the name of a person not directly involved in revolutionary activities.
201-798301
11. LITAMIL-7 was to pay a friendly visit to this person, asking no zeference
to politicis, but it using a prearranged code werd in the conversation.
This recomition signal would lead to the first creting with the courades
(probably two) who would escort IE/3 to Psar Kates.
12. IC/3 stated that he had another meeting with "Talentín" at 2200
that same evening (29 July at the Café Literario where he hopes to ob-
tain acre detail regarding the thing of the trips. 2/3 said that he pre-
ferred to make the first trip to Tapachule, o 1 gust since RING/4
was greatly upset over the recent developments and had to be clawed down.
He added that 1/4 was very pessimistic over 1/2's chances of returning
from such a trip alive and he would have to reassure has that he intended
to toro all
13. Inasmuch as howton's careful review of traffic for the period
12 12-24 oly failed to reveal any telepiche call from anyone actor-/3
to make the trip to Japachula, and in fact revealed traffic indicating that
3 was in Mexico City during the perica 19-21 ly, when he claimed
to be in Tapachula, Roxton stated that he did not believe L's story re-
garding his initial contact with "Talentir" and his trip to Tapachula. Since
Fort z's telephone ansering service reported repeated message's fra "señor
Juarez" and 3 bisern true case, he felt he could use this rather than
intisate in any way that 43's (safecause those was tapped. ZENG/3 be-
care choroughly upset, as he had done on the previous occasion when Rowton
had impugned his veracity, and assured Roxton with tears in his eyes that
he had always been "fundamentally" honest, although he might have exagge-
rated in the matter of details ari exact dates. 2/3 was so exoticrally dis-
turbed that he felt it raise to press he zatter further at that time and
proposed to 13 that he (icwton) meet with 30/4 that evening at 2200,
when he would be zeeting with "Valentin" again. Eorton turned down 1/3's
invitation to be present at the Café Literario so that he could get a look
at "Valentin" hisself since Rowton hoped that the meeting-would be covered
in any case by the Station team (which had 1/3 under surveillance since
the previous afternoon).
14. 3/4 came to the safehouse at 2200tems able to talk pri-
vately with her for about two hours. The arrive in a highly emotional
