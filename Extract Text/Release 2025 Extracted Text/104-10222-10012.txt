Charles A. Briggs
DDO Information Review Officer
Appreciation
1. As you know well, on September 19th, I turn over
responsibility for release or denial of DDO documents under
the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts. The experience
has been both frustrating and challenging, epitomizing the
issues in transition from a totally classified past to a new
intelligence environment yet to be defined. The tension in
law between protection of sources and methods and more open
government was apparent, daily, to those involved; good case
law was made as we sought to adhere to both principles and
to regain, through this process, some credibility for the
Agency.
2.
I've tried in the past to convey my appreciation
for the truly magnificent support I got from what is now
the Privacy and Information Action Group, through recommenda-
tions for the Unit Citation subsequently awarded by the DCI,
through QSI's. and promotions, and through personal comment.
All have worked long hard hours and all, those now in PIAG
and those who have left, deserve credit for their professional
efforts in this arena; I want to express my thanks to you for
the assistance your people gave to me as the DDO Information
Review Officer.
3. At the risk of being unfair to some who are more
recent arrivals, I want to express particular and very
personal thanks to win Brown, Cis Cass, Lou Dube, Mary Felton,
Doris LeBaron, Fred McCann, Karen Rice, Helen Stilson, Jon
Wolfe and Mack Wood,
4. My debt to Fred Randall and Andy Addona has been
made a matter of record on several occasions. Let me jus t
note here that any supervisor who has had the kind of
qualitative backing that those two gentlemen gave me
fortunate indeed.

5. In addition to the PIAG crowd, Paul Haefner's people
i
have had the endless and repetitive job of searching the
CHAOS files and helping me deal with that most sensitive
aspect of past history. Please express my thanks to them
and, most particularly, to Paul himself.
6. Finally, let me make special note of the contributions
from Joe Gigliotti and the retired officers handling the OSS
records requests. Their particular expertise was a welcome
addition to the staff support received.
7. I'm sure all will give Bob Owen, in his new role,
the same high quality support that they gave to me. To state
the obvious, although the win record is quite good, the race
is still on.

C/CNG
Promotion Recommendation - Frederick C. Randall to GS-15
1. This memorandum constitutes a formal recommendation that Fred
Randall, GS-14/8, now Chief of the DDO Privacy Information (DDO/PIC)
unit in Services Staff, be promoted to GS-15. The position calls for
that grade.
2. Mr. Randall is 49 years of age; entered on duty in CIA in
September 1951 as a GS-7, assigned to OSO/FDZ. He is married; has four
children, served briefly in the Air Force (1945-46); has an AB in
Government, an AM in Foreign Affairs, and was a PhD candidate in
International Relations. His Agency service was in FE from 1953 to
1965, including overseas tours in Djakarta and Tokyo; in DOD/FRD
from 1965 to March 1975, including 2 years in the DC field office;
his current assignment dates from 16 March 75. His date of grade is
June 1967.
3. The specifics of Mr. Randall's current assignment and all the
superlatives about it I have just recounted in a fitness report which
I prepared today, as well as in a QSI recommendation (approved) of
October 1975 and an out-of-cycle promotion recommendation dated
8 August 1975. I rate his performance Outstanding and refer the
reader(s) to the reports cited for details. I would note here that
Mr. Randall changed his home base and functional category in November
of 1975 and was rated number 1 of 4 Category C nominees from this Staff
by all four members of the SS Panel. I would note further that when
I submitted my August 75 out-of-cycle promotion recommendation, Mr.
Randall's career designation was B/OG; given his personal circumstances
the DDO suggested that Randall change his career designation to become
more competitive "and have an excellent chance on the next go round."
The QSI suggestion then resulted.
4. As the individual responsible for releasing or denying
thousands of DDO documents in response to FOIA requests, and subsequently
answering for DDO decisions in affidavits and court depositions, I know
how well Fred does his work and how richly he deserves this promotion to
GS-15.

ATTN:
SUBJECT: One-Time Reclama - Requested Randall Promotion
As you know, OB is not reticent about expressing his views, and in the informal
career development world, Fred had had it in FRD. I've known OB fairly well and re-
spect his candor and professionalism; we just worked very well together on the GS-
16/17 Panel, with an interestingly identical philosophy. Fred's performance did not
satisfy OB, and his Fitness Reports reflect that fact. It does not surprise me, since
Fred had been in FR from 1970-1975, that his Fitness Reports for the past years would
put him in a neutral middle, or even low middle, ranking among B/OG officers. But
that's yesterday.
Today, as I tried to say strongly in my 8 August, memo, my view of his work is
that it is Outstanding--and I don't so rate many officers. I would hope his present
work could stand on its own merit, and project forward, expecting FOIA to be a way of
life in the DDO with all the management challenge, and headache, that poses. His
present and future peer competition should be with the A/C crowd, not the B/OS group--
if that hurdle is determining.
At the risk of being irritating, I feel bound to state his case in what I con-
sider the appropriate competitive environment, to avoid an out-of-cycle suggestion
doing mischief to the system. Any hope?

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations
SUBJECT:
Out-of-Sequence Promotion Recommendation:
Fred Randall
1. We've spoken of the need to look further at both Agency
and DDO implications of the Freedom of Information Act and, now,
the Privacy Act, including the increased number of appeals and
litigation cases, and of the logic of collecting a coterie of
deponents or affiants to take some of the load off of both you
and me. The grade level of the appeals officers and the deponents
must include 14's and 15's, to incorporate the necessary clout
with the divisions and judgment vis-a-vis release of information
to the outside world.
2. Fred is a CS-14/7. He had just come to me at the time of
the last GS-15 panel exercise and had not been recommended for
promotion by FRD. I consider his performance over the past 6 months
to have been Outstanding. He is head and shoulders above the other
directorates' FIOs; I have considerable laudatory testimony from
OGC, OLC, O/DDA and within the DDO as to his professionalism, tact,
persuasiveness, analytic skills and realistic, while tough-minded,
protection of DDO sources and methods. This includes occasional
arm-wrestling with DDO branch/division/staff chiefs, OGC and OLC
lawyers, FBI contacts and others above his current grade level.
3. I have discussed this proposed out-of-cycle promotion
recommendation to GS-15 with Ev, who, in turn, has mentioned it
to Gordon. The return signals I got sounded positive.
4. I do, therefore, recommend that you, approve Fred's promotion
to GS-15, effective as soon as the action can be cut.
