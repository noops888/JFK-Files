In August 1951 the Agency was interested in contacting Professor
Edouard POLDINI, a geophysicist and professor at the University of
Geneva and formerly an employee of the SCHLUMBERGER CORPORATION in
Paris, for operational use. He was to be used as a channel to a Janus
KANTAS who could give information about the fate of the previous employees of
the Jersey Company in Hungary, the production figures and extent of
exploitation of existing oil fields and exploration of new oil fields
together with the names of the officials of the Russian Hungarian Company
who took over the Jersey Company.
In March 1953 the SCHLUMBERGER file reflects that an FBI source
furnished information that one Maurice Henri MARTIN, employed as an
engineer by the SCHLUMBERGER Company, Paris, France, received a letter
dated 27 July 1951 at Moscow from one Biegfried Stefanovitch MOROSOFF,
asking MARTIN for specialized information concerning geophysics. The
letter requested that MARTIN's reply be forwarded to Moscow through an inter-
mediary. From January 1932 until April 1937 MARTIN represented the SCHLUMBERGER
Company in Russia as an engineer, and it was thought that the correspondence
from MOROSOFF may represent a Soviet attempt to resume contact with MARTIN
and develop clandestine relations with him. The FBI conducted an investi-
gation dated June 1953 and determined that Maurice Henri MARTIN resided
at Nod Hill, Wilton, Connecticut and was employed by the SCHLUMBERGER
Well Surveying Co., Ridgefield, Connecticut. Informants advised that
although MARTIN was strongly nationalistic toward France, he gave every
indication of being anti-Russian and there was no evidence of CP activities.
When DAYSTROM, INC. merged with SCHLUMBERGER, LTD., research was
done on the directors and officers of SCHLUMBERGER, LTD. The results
are as follows:
OS indices reflect a record on Dillon ANDERSON, a trustee of
Electro-Mechanical Research, Inc. (a subsidiary of SCHLUMBERGER, LTD.)
who was also a proposed trustee of "NEW DAYSTROM" when it merged with
SCHLUMBERGER. ANDERSON is an attorney from Houston, Texas who was
appointed by President EISENHOWER as an advisor to the National Security
Council from 1953 until 1956. He was considered for a special clearance
in August 1955 but the briefing was not given. He was granted a covert O
clearance in December 1953 and April 1954 for use as a covert associate
on Project LPFUNNEL. J

SCHLUMBERGER, LTD., Houston, Texas, French citizen, was of contact

Charles C. PARLIN, Director of SCHLUMBERGER, LTD., and a member
of the law firm of SHEARMEN, STERLING and WRIGHT, Englewood, New
Jersey, U. S. citizen, was of contact interest in 1962 but was
security disapproved. PARLIN was allegedly the boy friend of Johanna
BEKER who was in contact with known Soviet Agents, ROBERT and JACK
SOBLE. BEKER advised the FBI in 1957 that she received, paid for and
transmitted to Robert SOBLE, OSS information which was given her by
two former OSS employees. She also advised the FBI in 1957 that she
SECRET
had given a very general outline of her activities to PARLIN ani
it is reliably reported that PARLIN and EMER shared a hotel roon
in Folland in 1957. PARLIN recorrented & Willion bart LANCASTER

PARLIN and had a long record of Cortunist, front affiliations. PARLIN
