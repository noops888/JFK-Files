PROCEEDINGS
The Chairman. We will soon have a quorum. Why don't
we begin with the Recommendation No. 43 on page 77, having
to do with academics.
My understanding is that this recommendation has been
redrafted along the lines of the Committee's recommendations, and
as it now stands it calls for the CIA academics and the
institution to be informed, and for any student being recruited
to be so informed..
:
There is a choice in the latter case in informing him
before he is paid or informing him before he leaves the U.S.
Will you explain that to me, please?
Mr. Aaron. In the course of our discussion about the
recruitment of students off campuses, there were two cate-
gories of concern. One was for the integrity of the institu-
was
tions themselves, and the second was, in turn, for the
students that might be involved.
To take the second one first, the Committee received
testimony that some foreign students recruited as agents for
the CIA were brought into kind of a holding status at a certain
point in which they were working for, if you will, CIA
proprietaries or CIA front organizations where they might
conduct some operational activity, provide some information,
under the impression that they were not working for the CIA
but for a company or, I think as one put it, I think, a group
TOP SECRET

of investors.
2
Concern was expressed by the Committee in considering
3
this testimony that this might be rather severe for the student
4
once he discovered the fact he had been working for the CIA,
5
6
7
or should his government find that out, so that it was an
element of coercion to hire somebody under, if you will, false
pretenses.
8
9
10
11
That second proviso, then, in effect says that we may
pitch and recruit a student as an agent, but you must, when you
do that, when you really bring him into an operational relation-
ship with the Agency, he should be so informed and not brought
into this sort of
The Chairman. Let's go off the record.
(Discussion off the record.)
12
13
14
15
16
The Chairman. The question that I have on this recommen-
dation is why shouldn't the foreign student being recruited
17
18
by the CIA be informed of his relationship with the CIA
at the time that that relationship is established?
19
Why do you condition it upon payment or leaving the
20
country?
21
Senator Huddleston. Well, I was going to say there are
22
23
many, many initial contacts that do not advance maybe much
further than that, and for the CIA to have to be exposed maybe
24
on each of those might not be reasonable.
What we have tried
25
to do is to make the wittingness be known about the time that
TOP SECRET
WARD & PAUL
NW 50955 DocId: 32423521 Page 6
TOP SECRET
4
1
they are to perform some service. Up to that time they are
still maybe prospects, where they may not have been recruited.
The Chairman.
2
3
Which do you think the Committee should
4
adopt of these two options?
Mr. Aaron.
5
Actually, one could use both of these. I think
6
7
the point is that the danger to the student, if there is any,
comes when he leaves the United States, either to return to
8
9
10
his own country or perhaps someplace else, but the commitment
or involvement which ought to be witting really needs to come
when he starts being paid, when he becomes in fact, or has
11
a real relationship with the Agency.
You could really establish
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
both standards, because it might well be that he could leave
:
the country but not have yet been paid, and not really have
a relationship that was anything more than kind of an asso-
ciation or an option, something of that character.
The Chairman. Well, what is the will of the Committee
as to these two options?
Senator Huddleston. Well, this represents a distillation
19
of what we have been proposing as Senator Mondale develops
20
for us, I believe, and I would move that we adopt this report,
and use both of these, an either/or.
21
The Chairman.
22
23
24
25
Whichever comes first, huh, either before
he is given payment of any kind or leaves the United States,
whichever may occur first.
Would that be satisfactory to the Committee?
TOP SECRET

All right. Without objection, then, that will be the
decision of the Committee.
What else do you have?
Mr. Aaron. We have two other recommendations.
Senator Hart of Colorado. Mr. Chairman, could I be recorded

in opposition to this?
The Chairman. Yes, Senator Hart of Colorado is recorded
as in opposition.
Mr. Madigan. Senator, there is a proxy in opposition as
12 opposition as well.
Senator Baker wants to be recorded in
Senator Mathias. I would, I think Senator Goldwater had
13
14
15
a very strong proxy that I read into the record on this subject
at the last meeting.

25
Mr. Kirbow. Against restricting any use of academics.
Senator Mathias. I don't have a proxy with him today, but
I feel his position ought to be noted.
The Chairman. Very well, then, with those particular
reservations made part of the record, the Committee will
approve the amended Recommendation No. 43.
We move then to Recommendation 45 on page 78.
Mr. Aaron. We attempted to redraft this along the lines
as we were instructed, I believe.
As it came out, it would prohibit the subsidy of any
TOP SECRET

Page 8

6
writing, publication, distribution within the United States
1
or its territories, of any book, magazine, article and so forth.
2
It has been pointed out that this formulation would prevent
3
4
5
6
the writing of a book, even in a foreign language, within the
United States, to be published abroad and distributed abroad,
or any such materials from being published within the United
States, even if they were distributed abroad.
7
8
9
10
Now, that may be too restrictive and go beyond what the
Committee intended, and so therefore we wanted to raise this
here, to get a better understanding of what we were attempting
to accomplish.
11
As I understand it, what we were it was not clear, but
12
13
14
it is possible that what the Committee had in mind was that
any writing, publication for distribution in the United States
would have been the appropriate formulation for this, and if
15
that is correct, we can make a very easy fix.
16
17
18
Senator Morgan. Why wouldn't it?
The Chairman. Why wouldn't it accomplish it if we say
i
that by statute the CIA should be prohibited from subsidizing
19
20
21
22
the writing or production or distribution within the United
States or its territories of any book, magazine, article,
publication, film, or video or audio tape unless attributed
to the CIA.
23
Wouldn't that take care of it?
24
25
Mr. Aaron. If that is what the Committee intends, that

Publicly attributed.
10
11
Well, I think that follows and should be a part of it.
Very well.
12
Senator Mathias. Mr Chairman, I wonder, while we are in
13
14
15
this area, if you could refresh my recollection, whether
"grantees" in No. 44 applies to both foreign and American
grantees.
16
17
Mr. Bader. Yes, it would, Senator, under this language,
because the Fulbright program or the such government-sponsored
18 programs to include, too, include foreigners.
As I understood
19
it from the discussion of the Committee, the intent here was
20
to ensure that public funds that were publicly devoted to
21
a specific purpose were so spent and that was the issue that
22 was involved here, was the appropriated funds for educational

Could one of our networks pick up a portion of a film

to show what they are doing and that kind of thing?
:

10
is not a problem.
I think the way it has been modified that
This says "by statute the CIA should be

prohibited from subsidizing writings," or production.
Senator Tower. That is what I mean, you are not precluded
13
14
from showing it, but it should not be done under CIA auspices
or government auspices.
15
The Chairman. And it should not be written for the
16
purpose of being shown in this country.
17
Senator Tower. Yes.
:
18
Mr. Aaron. Nor under the indirect clause, I think, nor
19 should the CIA go to CBS and say "we've got this wonderful

film."

The Chairman. Using a network for the purpose of bringing

also.

agreed to extend
Mr. Kirbow. Excuse me, Mr. Aaron. Senator Mathias's
question was on recommendation 44.
The Chairman. Were you satisfied with the answer?
Senator Mathias. Well, the question that was left
floating was what about a student who is in a program which is
primarily funded by some private institution, although there
may be some small element --
Mr. Maxwell. For instance, any major university that
sponsored an individual coming under 44, which receives
We have one other
17
Federal Government funds, might be barred under a broad
18 reading of 44, and it might be helpful to make that intent
19
clearer in 44, if that is a concern of the Committee.
20
21
Mr. Aaron. I think this goes to the grantee as opposed
to the institution.
22
Now, if it is true
23
The Chairman.
It is the grantee that is receiving
24
funds.
25
Mr. Aaron.
NW 50955 DocId: DocId: 30423521 Page 12
If you have a grantee receiving funds from

more than one source, then he receives them from more than one

Mr. Maxwell.
But the problem is receiving funds through

educational and/or cultural programs.

7
8
9
For instance, if he were totally funded by the University
of Maryland, which received financial support from the United
States Government, arguably he is covered by that. It is not
that he is receiving Federal grants. I think that is the
intention.
10
11
12
The Chairman.
Mr. Aaron. It should be U.S. Government educational
Mr. Bader. Would that help?
Through educational and/or cultural
13
programs sponsored by the United States Government.
Wouldn't
14
that take care of it?

Senator Huddleston
Well, grantees who are receiving

directly from the United States Government or through educational

18
or cultural programs supported by the United States Government.
The Chairman. Sponsored by.
19
Senator Huddleston. Well, in other words, whether he is
20
22
getting them directly himself as a grantee, or whether he is
21 receiving them from an educational program that is itself
supported by the Federal Government.
23
Senator Mathias. I don't want to prolong this, but what
24
about a program which is really directed right at this area

grant that the State Department has where they bring foreigners
to the United States for a period of time, presumably to
7
acquaint them with the country and what have you, under this

9
being recruited by the CIA. This doesn't mean that they
10 couldn't recruit them at some other point in their careers, but

13
that during the period of that grant they would not be in
effect brought here and used for that purpose. That is, I
think, part of the intent of this particular provision.

be.
The Chairman. Well, it depends upon what the policy should
I had thought the attempt here was to immunize any foreigner
who comes here on a program sponsored by the Government of the
United States and receives a grant for that program, to
immunize him during that period from being recruited by the
CIA.
Senator Schweiker.
Well, if he is here for military
purposes, then we know it is a military relationship, I would
think that is suspect.
The Chairman. Would you want him subject to recruitment?
Senator Schweiker.
Well, if he comes over here militarily,
you are so close to him, what is the difference?
Mr. Aaron.
Well, I think the point of the prohibition
really is this, that these programs are created for one
particular purpose.
They are considered by the Congress for
that particular purpose and the funds are voted for that
TOP SECRET
WARD & PAUL
NW 50955 DocId: 32423521 Page 15

13
1 particular purpose.
If the programs are then used for another
purpose by the Government, that was considered and suggested
2
3
that that second purpose should not be used.
4
5
Now, if you want to exempt certain categories here and
say, well, the military is a different thing, you can do that.
You can find a way to express that.
6
7
The Chairman. Well, it could be done. If you want to
8
recruit foreign military officers, we can bring them over
9
to put them through the War College.
10
Mr. Miller. What other training?
:
11
Senator Huddleston. Well, we have a steady stream at
12
Fort Knox, Kentucky of military people. I don't know what kind
13
of training.
Most of them are, of course, are from friendly
14
nations to start with.

other policies here we allow them to recruit foreign military

than the students, but I make it clear that what we don't

want to do, which is to abort our honest to goodness cultural
23
exchange and other programs.

most of the people the damned Soviets send over here on these

here. I am not going to tie our hands like that. The rest
of you can, but I'm not going to.
9
I will write a vigorous dissent on that.
:
10
Senator Morgan. May I make a comment on that?
11
I'm inclined to agree, and I'm also inclined to agree
12
13
14
15
that we are going so far in our foreign intelligence that
we are endangering the whole report, so you make that kind of
an argument on the floor of the Senate on this and on two or
three other things. I'm not picking at any of them. I am
16
17
18
19
just sort of accepting the recommendations of the Subcommittee,
but my reaction has been that maybe we are getting a little
bit so far afield that we may endanger the acceptance of our
whole report.
20
The Chairman. Senator Huddleston?
21
Senator Huddleston.
I would just say this, that the
22
Subcommittee has been cognizant of that situation. I think it is
23.
because of that that some of these recommendations are already
24
softer than some of us thought would be appropriate, and this
25
is one of the fields.
There was a considerable amount of support
TOP SECRET
WARD & PAUL
NW, 50955 DocId: 32423521 Page 18
TOP SECRET
17
1
of the idea that academics be off limits, period, and students
2
3
4
5
6
7
8.
in order to protect the integrity of our entire academic
community, and it is the realization that if we continued to
close the possibilities for recruitment, and the adverse
effect that that would have, maybe, on our ability to gather
intelligence, that some of us backed off of this, what would
be the optimum, we think, position to take.
So this already
represents somewhat of a retreat from the principle that some
9
would like to see established, and in this case I think we
10
11
12
13
14
15
are again faced with the question of whether or not we want
a government-sponsored program to enjoy a high level of integrity
so that the people who are participating in it and the American
taxpayer who is supporting it can have some confidence that it
is doing what it was set out to do and what the publicly...
announced purposes of it are.
16
17
18
19
20
21
And if we don't do that, if we permit it to be used as
an operational intelligence operation, then it seems to me like
we ought to announce that, that that ought to be one of the
purposes so stated in the grant to start with, while we are
likely to get an education, it is also likely if we can we
will have you gather intelligence for us.
22
Senator Morgan. Well, Dee, I think you are getting off
23
base for us. There is nothing that says they are required to
do it.
24
25
Senator Huddleston. That is correct.

Senator Morgan. In other words, we are not going to

condition this grant on
3
Senator Huddleston.
Well --
4
Senator Morgan. Let me finish out, now. What you are
5
leading up to is you are saying we are going to condition this
6
grant on your cooperation with other governmental agencies.
Senator Huddleston.
7.
I am saying that is not beyond the
8
9
realm of possibility in some cases, if we don't put some
prohibition.
10
11
12
Senator Morgan. Well, I think there may be times,
especially in the light of what we heard in the past year,
when, you know, we might make that assumption, but I don't
13
think that on the whole when you are dealing with the United
14
States Government that you can really assume
Senator Hudddleston.
15
But you can't assume he is not,
either.
16
The Chairman. But what worries me is you get a student
17
18
19
who in good faith goes abroad for the purpose of study and
qualifies for a Government grant, and he depends upon that
20
money and then he, when he gets over there and wants to complete
his studies, he is approached, and he can be approached in
21
22
such a way that he can be made to feel that if he does not
throw in with the CIA and do this and that, he may find that
23
24
25
the grant will be cut off or he can't complete the study as he
intended. He feels a certain dependency upon the money that

he is receiving, and he has an expectation he wants to fulfill.
2
3
And thus he is in a very vulnerable position when he is
approached.
4
Senator Morgan. Well, that is a persuasive argument, but
5
6
let me ask you, have we had any evidence that that sort of
thing has happened?
7
The Chairman. Well, I don't know.
8

10
11
12
13
Senator Morgan. Well, it is a very persuasive argument,
but I just wonder if we should, in the absence of abuse on
;
that part, whether or not we should go this far.
The Chairman. What about it, Mr. Bader?
Mr. Bader. Mr. Chairman, I might say in partial response
to Senator Tower's remarks that the Agency's basic instruction
1
14
15
16
for the operational use of individuals, 50-10, specifically.
prohibits the operational use of Fulbright grantees. They have
already made that decision in 1967, and reconfirmed in 1973.
17
18
19
I assume part of that came from agitation at the time in '67
and Senator Fulbright's own determination that that program not
be used for operational purposes.
20
It was the original intent of this language to extend
21
that prohibition, which is now a matter of public record, this-
22
actually, that part of the instruction is in the public record
23 now under the Freedom of Information Act, that part of 50-10
:
:
24
that talks about Fulbright grantees. It was the original
25
intent of the recommendation that is now before you to extend
NW 50955 DocId: 32423521 Page 21

that prohibition on Fulbright grantees to all of those under

the Fulbright-Hayes legislation. Under the specifics of the
Agency's interpretation, it makes a distinction between those
students, or graduate students, or professors selected by the
Board of Foreign Scholarships, and the rest and the rest
includes cultural leader grants and the like.
7
8
Now, perhaps it might be the sensible thing in the
language like this to confine it to the Fulbright-Hayes Act,
which is the basic legislation which deals with this.
9.
Senator Schweiker. How many others would you have outside
10
of that? Would you have a lot of other programs?
11
Mr. Bader. Other programs?
12
Senator Schweiker.
What percent of the total picture is
13
the Fulbright-Hayes Act?
14
15
16
17
18
Mr. Bader. I really wouldn't know, Senator. I think it
is the major part of it, actually. You could have a National
Endowment for the Humanities fellowship in which a person would
go overseas, and this, under the language we now have before
you, that would include those individuals.
19
20
The Chairman. Well, I can see how vulnerable a grantee
might be when approached, and if we have already written
21
into law a prohibition that relates to the Fulbright scholars,
22
I should think it ought to apply to any others that are
23
receiving educational or cultural grants from the United
24
States.
