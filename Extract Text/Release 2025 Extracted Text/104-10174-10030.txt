MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Payment to Edvard G. Tichborn (P)
1. On 9 May this office received a telegram (in the file)
from Tichborn (P) dated 5 May 1960 in which he stated that he had
not yet received his check for $650.00 from Ashmead, Hanniferd 24
Associates
2. The undersigned contacted Mr. Thomas Strange, Cover
Division, to find out the reason for this delay. After following
up this request he informed me that said check had cleared
Tichborn's (P) California bank on 27 April, the Federal Reserve
on 29 April and is now in Cover Division as a cancelled check.
3. I tried to phone Tichborn (P) late Monday afternoon (9 May)
but he was not in his office. I reached him this morning and
advised him that the money had beer deposited in his bank on the
date noted above. Tichborn (P) said he had not checked with the
bank but would do so.
