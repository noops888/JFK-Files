The subject was utilized by Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) as an informant in the communist-dominated Greek Maritime Sdala
Organization, OENO His past activities have been the subject/
of correspondence between us and CIA. During the past year, this
usefulness to CIA had practically expired, primarily because of
subject's desire to remove himself from the OENO atmosphere (8)
On September 13, 1960, Mrs. Jane Roman, CIA, advised
that the subject is currently a crew member of the SS Radnor,
which is scheduled to dock at New Orleans within the next two
(5)
weeks. (CIA has had clandestine meetings with Moutos andis (5)
now endeavoring to work out an arrangement whereby he can travel to
Cuba and can serve as a source of information in that country. In
order to arrange for such travel, it will be necessary for Moutos
to jump ship at New Orleans. This will be done with the approval
approval (5)
(5) of Immigration and Naturalization Service. CIA will then hold
conferences with Moutos and subject will thereupon proceed to
Havana under a cover being established for him.J(5) him
ESIMETHIO
Prior to leaving for Havana, Moutos will endeavor to
have contact with his wife, Angela Boyer, who is well known to
us and who has a communist background. His marriage to Boyer
was actually promoted in order to improve his position in OENO
He has been separated from his wife for a lengthy period although
she has indicated that she desires to live with him again. CIA
hopes that a resumption of relations between the two will helps
Moutos in establishing worthwhile contacts in communist circles
in Cuba.
