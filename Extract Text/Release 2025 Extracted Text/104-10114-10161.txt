SUBJ: FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE
At the request of Mr. Dave Phillips, C/WH/4/Propoganda, I spent
the evening of January 6 with Court Wood, a student who
has recently returned from a three week stay in Cuba under the
sponsorship of the FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE.
2. Court and his father both have voiced very strong Pro-Castro
sentiments and are extremely critical of our foreign policy
in general.
3. I've been advised by Mr. Phillips to continue my relationship
with Mr. Wood and I will keep your office informed of each
subsequent visit.
4. This is forwarded to you as a matter of information and to
become a permanent part of my security file.
