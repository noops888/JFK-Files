the end of any year in which you, while under age 72 at least one full month of that year, or any child for whom you are
filing, earned more than $1,200. Also, your benefit is not payable for any month you do not have in your care a child of
the deceased entitled to a child's benefit unless you are receiving benefits because you are a widow age 62 or over.
FAILURE TO REPORT THESE EVENTS MAY RESULT IN THE LOSS OF ADDITIONAL
MONTHLY BENEFITS.

tions (however, all marriages must be reported); or (b) she is under age 62 and no child of the deceased is entitled to
child's insurance benefits.
A child's entitlement to benefits ends with the month before the month in which the child: (a) attains age 18 (unless the
child has a physical or mental impairment which began before age 18, is expected to be long-lasting, and prevents any sub-
stantial gainful activity); (b) dies; (c) marries, with certain exceptions where the child is disabled (however, all marriages
must be reported); or (d) is legally adopted (unless the adoption is by the child's stepparent, grandparent, aunt, or uncle
after the death of the parent on whose record the child's claim is based).
If the child is age 18 or over and is receiving benefits as a disabled child, his entitlement to benefits also ends with the
second month after the month in which his disability ceases.
30. Do you agree to notify the Social Security Administration promptly if any of these events occur
and to return promptly any check for benefits received by you if you or any of the children are
not entitled to it?
