Sua of Initial Missions
In the period from 20 June to 10 July 1956 the Soviet Bloc air defense
system was subjected to eight penetrations of an unprecedented nature, seven
occurring within a period of only eight days. It must be remembered that
Comprovides the only basis of judging the performance of the Soviet
system. This is important because it is clear from REGAL raterial that
considerable air defense business is conducted over landlines and thus not
observed by COMINT. However, some tentative conclusions may be drawn from
these initial flights and these are indicated as follows:
1. In spite of the fact that these missions come as a surprise,
zone of them went undetected. This is clear evidence that their
rader coverage extends above 72,000 feet.

2. By 5 July 1956, the fourth flight, the USSR was aware
of the purpose of the missions and were taking counter action.
One positive action was the standdown of civil flights while the
mission aircraft was over the USSR, and a second action which is
believed related is the moving of MIG-19 aircraft into East
Cermany and Poland on 7 July 1956. Also MIG-19's were moved
into Hungary at about this time.
3. The performance of the Soviet system on the 5 July mission,
٦٠٠
2014, was indeed curious. While the action evident from COMIT
is not clear an explanation which appears to fit the known facts
is offered as follows: As a result of the previous missions, the
Soviets had concluded the essential facts concerning the missions,
1.e., that they were for reconnaissance, that they flew above 65,000
feet, and that a penetration as deep as Moscow was possible. They
probably surmised that the 5 July mission was headed for Moscow when
the track appeared on a northeasterly heading. The loss of the
target when it entered Soviet territory was probably deliberate and
the "red herring" track returning to the wast was either a dodge
or a convenience to avoid broadcasting a track for all the system
to see that a 'hostile or intruder" was coming over Moscow with no
means available to stop it. This idea is supported by the use
of a raid number assigned in the region just beyond the point
where the track had been "lost". In addition, the track was not
labeled "costile or intruder" when it was broadcast after it
had passed beyond Moscow. The reporting of the track when it did
appear was only by Moscow and it has been suggested that other
stations had been instructed not to broadcast the track. Further, it may
or may not be a coincidence that the height broadcast was almost
exactly half of the true altitude of the mission aircraft, but on
the next missions, four days later, the altitude reporting was
consistently above 50,000 feet.
4. By 9 July 1956, in addition to the evident recognition of
the great height of the mission flights, tracking was better and
in general the performance of the warning system was much improved.
5. The next day, 10 July 1956, the Soviet air defense warning
system closed a 3000 mile track with only two short periods of
confusion or track loss. Altitude reporting was over 60,000 feet
with one plot passed 68,800 which was only 100 feet off target.
6. The first cight missions proved that the air defense warning
system is deployed in depth. This was evident from both the continuity
of track and most forcefully from the ELIT data collected. Some 1461
intercepts of Soviet Bloc radars operating in the 3000 mc/s band were
cotained by project ELINT as follows: TOKEN-1331, WHIFF-37, GAGE-26,
PATTY CAKE-37, Other 30. These numbers cannot be equated to in-
dividual radar sets since the same radar ray be intercepted more than
chee. 618 TOKEN sites were located, including 213 new sites. Some
343 additional TOKEN signals were identified out available information
aces not permit determination of location so that it must be con-
cluded that these signals include both known and new sites. Because
of the limitation of ELINT to the 3000 mc/s band and the Soviet
practice of collocating radars on different frequencies the total
mber of radars may be expected to be at least double the number
cf sites.

7. Confusion and track loss seemed to be related to the
presence of large numbers of fighters although the saturation point
has not been determined because of insufficient date.
8. The question of radars for height finding, the capabilities
of TOKEN in this role, the introduction of ROCK CAKES and later
developments are discussed in another section. It is believed,
however, that these missions were a catalyst in the introduction
of ROCK CAKES.
