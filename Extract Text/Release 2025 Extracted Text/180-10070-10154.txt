Assassination Records Review Board
Final Determination Notification
AGENCY : HSCA
RECORD NUMBER : 180-10070-10154
RECORD SERIES : STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS
AGENCY FILE NUMBER :
December 8, 1995
Status of Document: Postponed in Part
Number of releases of previously postponed information: 7
Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors
including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the
absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.
Number of Postponements: 3
Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.
Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could
reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of
privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

We have received Form CA-1 reporting an injury and your agency's response
to the evidence submitted. It has been determined that:
X
1. The facts of the injury and employment support the employee's
contention that he/she was a Federal employee who sustained a
traumatic disabling injury in the performance of duty. You
should, therefore, continue his/her pay for the period of dis-
ability not to exceed 45 days.
X
2. The information of record is insufficient to make a decision on
3.
the case; however, you should continue the employee's pay without
interruption. Additional information is required as noted on the
reverse of this letter.
