2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
HEMORANDUM FOR:
2 August 1978
General Counsel
Director of Security
FROM
:
S.D. Breckinridge
SUBJECT
: HSCA Request of 20 July 1978
OLC-78-2728
1. Attached is correspondence from the DDO focal
point on the IISCA investigation, responding to Question
12 of reference. It states that there are and have been
no agreements (at least not as described in the IISCA
request) between CIA and the FBI, or other governaent
agencies, that pertain to the Agency's responsibilities
to report on U.S. citizens abroad who contact Communist
embassies or officials. It also states that current
legislation forbids such reporting.
2. Attached are copies of papers collected by
O/IG during the Rockefeller Commission's inquiry; I
recall that there was a 1966 agreement, which is not in
these papers. In any event they do not seem to contain
a specific provision such as is envisioned in the report.
It is possible that interpretations of NSCID and DCID
provisions resulted in routine reporting of such con-
tacts, although there were no agreements, per se, for
such action. Since the promulgation of Executive
Orders 11905 and 12036 there have been limitations on
reporting on U.S. persons, which may affect past practice.
llowever, this office is not in a position to provide an
Agency position on this issue.
3. It is requested that you coordinate with the
DDO in preparing an answer to an Agency response to
the HSCA question.

2. UE. WERE ESPECIALLY GRATIFIED WITH THE OPENING PARAGRAPHS OF
THE LETTER WHICH EMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT FR IS CARRYING OUT A U.S.
GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENT IN ITS RECRUITMENT OF FOREIGI: INTELLIGENCE
SOURCES AND THAT THIS ACTIVITY IS BEING CONDUCTED IN THE USA WITH
FULL BUREAU CONCURRENCE. ANOTHER BASIC POINT WHICH THE LETTER MAKES
IS THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE GUIEDELINES (1966 AGREEMENT) IS TO PROTECT
THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE U.S.EGOVERNMENT, NOT ENABLE THE BUREAU TO
MONITOR OUR OPERATIONS.
:
3. THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE DISCUSSION INVOLVED IN DRAFTING THIS
LETTER, BUT NO REAL STICKY DIFFERENCES AROSE. WE BELIEVE IT MIGHT BE
USEFUL TO GIVE ADDRESSEES SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THESE DISCUSSIONS
AS BACKGROUND FOR ANY TALKS YOU MAY HAVE ON THESE SUBJECTS WITH YOUR
FIELD OFFICE CONTACTS. THESE ARE SET OUT BELOW:
:
A. PAGE 2, LAST PARAGRAPH: ON THE QUESTION OF WHAT FOREIGN
-OFFICIALS ARE OF "PRESUMED INTEREST" TO THE BUREAUS WE AGREED THAT
THIS CATEGORY CHANGED WITH WORLD DEVELOPMENTS AND THAT FR WOULD
SIMPLY USE A COMMON SENSE JUDGMENT TO MAKE ITS CASE BY CASE DETER-

C. PAGE 3, BOTTOM PARAGRAPH: ALTHOUGH WE ARE REQUIRED ON
TO KEEP FBI APPRISED OF INFORMATION RELATING TO ITS COUNTERINTELLIG
AND INTERNAL SECURITY RESPONSIBILITIES, WE CONCURRED IN THIS REQUES
FOR MORE DETAILED AND TIMELY REPORTING ON CERTAIN CASES SINCE WE
CONSIDERED THE DETAIL ASKED FOR TO BE OF DEMONSTRABLE CI VALUE AND
TIME LIMITS TO BE REASONABLE. THE BUREAU WAS COMPLETELY AMENABLE 1
LIMITING SUCH REQUIREMENTS TO CASES WHEREIN THEIR STATUTORY RESPO:
SIBILITIES WERE CLEARLY INVOLVED, AND WE WERE PARTICULARLY PLEASED
THE ADDITIONAL AGREEMENT ALLOWING THE FIELD OFFICES AND THE FR BASI
TO WORK OUT THE LOCAL HANDLING OF ALL OTHER CASES, INCLUDING &3850

BUREAU HAS ALREADY AGREED TO PROVIDE US WITH CERTAIN TYPES OF OPERA-
TIONAL INFORMATION IN EXCESS OF ANY EXISTING AGREEMENT, AND WE HAVE
RECEIVED INITIALLY FAVORABLE REACTION TO PROPOSALS FOR ADDITIONAL
ITEMS IN THE FUTURE. UE DO NOT BELIEVE THIS REPORTING AGREEMENT UILL
CAUSE YOU ANY SERIOUS PROBLEMS, BUT IF IT SHOULD BE BROADENED OR
INTERPRETED IN A WAY THAT YOU CONSIDER UNREASONABLE OR BURDENSOME,
PLEASE ADVISE AND WE WILL TRY TO HAVE THE CRITERIA DEFINED MORE LEGERO
CLEKRUBEOSELY.
D. PAGE 4. BOTTOM PARAGRAPH: WE HAD CONSIDERABLE DISCUSSION
ON THIS SUBJECT. THE CBUREAU FELT THAT IN SOME INSTANCES WE WERE
"STRETCHING" THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS INTO THE FIRST STAGES OF RECRUIT-
MENT AND IN SOME OTHERS UE WERE MOVING INTO RECRUITMENT WITHOUT
: FORMALLY SEEKING BUREAU CONCURRENCE AND COORDINATION. GOOD FAITH
BEING PRESUMED, IT BECAME APPARENT THAT OUR PROBLEM WAS BOTH SEMANTIC
FAND ONE OF DEFINITION. THE BUREAU INSISTS, AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT
• CONCURRENCE IN OUR PROCEEDING WITH ASSESSMENT CANHOT BE INTERPRETEED
AS CONCURRENCE TO MOVE BEYOND ASSESSMENT. THEY EXPLAIN THAT THEY

OFTEN CONCUR IN OUR ASSESSMENT OF TARGETS IN WHOM THEY HAVE A VE
ACTIVE "RECRUITMENT INTEREST" WITH BUREAU SOURCES IN TOUCH, ETC.
HENCE, BEFORE THE AGENCY MOVES INTO THE ACTUAL RECRUITMENT OPERA
THE BUREAU NEEDS SPECIFIC NOTICE IN ORDER TO ASSESS ITS OUN COUN
INTELLIGENCE OR INTERNAL SECURITY EQUITIES AND MAKE A DECISION.
THE DEFINITIONS OF "ASSESSMENT" AND "RECRUITMENT" IN THE LE
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED TOGETHER: THE ONLY POSSIBLE AREA OF CONFUSI
HOULD SEEM TO BE IN THE "PROCESS" OF RECRUITMENT. A SIMPLIOFIED
COMMON SENSE BREAKDOWN WOULD BE THAT ASSESSMENT IS THE OBTAINING
AND ANALYZING OF INFORMATION CONCERNING A TARGET INDIVIDUAL TO E
US TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT IT IS DESIRABLE-AND/OR FEASIBLE T
MOUNT A RECRUITMENT APPROACH; IF OUR ASSESSMENT IS AFFIRMATIVE.
THEN MOVE INTO THE RECRUITMENT PHASE
