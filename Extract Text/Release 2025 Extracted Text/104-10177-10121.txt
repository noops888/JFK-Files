Termination of Paul D. LANGEVIN
HER: SAGO 903 dated 10 October 1953
1. Attached are a) statement of termination signed by subject
and b) agent's service record. Submision of these items
has been delayed pending receipt of Field Instruction 236-1.
Since this instruction has not been received we are submitting
the enclosures to close the record on this case.
2.
Paul D. LANGEVIN may be used for recruiting tasks before his
permanent departure from Chile in April 1954. His security
is not questioned and he has expressed a willingness to per-
form such tasks..
3. He also requests arrangements for the payment of income tax
on his earnings ouring 1953. This matter will be handled
by cable in view of time element.
4. The following explains the timing of LANGEVIN's termination:
he had been advised that he would be terminated one month
after all advances had been liquidaten. This would have
• been 30 September 1953. This ante was also chosen since
it was expected that COALIUS would take over FURIOS0 "C"
at about that time. COKONTUS did take over the project.
early in October. However, LANG VIN dia no work during the
month of September for which he would be entitled to pay-
ment, althoum he presumably was available for duty. The
last payment of 357.44 for the Leriod 1 through 31 August
195 was in addition to the liquidation or his avances
although it did not cover a over a full month fror the cate of
such liquidat on which must have occuried sometime in August.

Sago-360
par CEX 10-43
1. Pursuant to the verbal statements of Dennis K. COPELAND at the Lima Confer-
ence of certain Station Chiefs, pertaining to ZACACTUS Operations in Chile,
the following suggestions are advanced for Headquarters consideration:
a) Cover for Chile, Official:
The Air Attache, Col. William ROSS, talked at length with General ACKERMAN,
Assistant A-2, AFGS, while attending the Panama Service Attache Conference,
on the question of providing a replacement for the Air Officer who had
originally been scheduled for Santiago Air Attache Office to handle ZACACTUS.
ROSS, who is a very intelligent, capable officer, with excellent intelli-
gence experience, told ACKERMAN that he would appreciate being considered
for this assignment in addition to his regular duties, as he was keenly
interested in this type of endeavor. He was of the opinion that he could
devote as large a share of his time to this work as would any other officer
so assigned to his office. Furthermore, due to the size of his staff,
three officers, he felt he could assign the bulk of his Air duties to his
assistants and concentrate his efforts on ZACACTUS matters, which he thought
were of greater Importance in Chile. General ACKERMAN, according to ROSS,
was not adverse to this proposal but stated he would await contact from
ZACACTUS Headquarters before considering the matter further.
This Station has high regard for ROSS and is of the opinion that he would
apply himself in a very diligent and intelligent männer to the duties of
handling ZACACTUS in Chile. He is fully aware of the necessity for discre-
tion, as he had been briefed on this at the time the former ZACACTUS candi-
date had been considered for the Air Attache Office.

This Station highly recommends Headquarters consideration of FULMINATER-1
as the principal ZACACTUS operator in Chile on a permanent basis. This
person is well known to this Station and has demonstrated his ability in
handling FULMINATER-2 and the publication of the posters/stickers for the

UN-ECOSOC propaganda effort. His assets are generally as follows:
1) Covers He is publisher and editor of a fairly successful weekly news-
paper in Chil. Although he is at the moment considering the possibility
of selling this newspaper, he has been encouraged to defer such action
for thirty days pending Headquarters' decision on his case. This paper
has its own printing presses and is capable of handling large printing
"orders of all types. This activity could be regulated in such a manner
that it would only require a minimum amount of FULMINATER-1's time and
would provide him with an excellent cover for his ZACACTUS activities.
2) Ability: He is a writer, playwrite, publisher and editor. Those
qualifications plus his initiative, imaginativeness, ingenuity and broad
intellectual background should qualify him for ZACACTUS operations. He,
of course, has an excellent command of Spanish as well as French and
German.
3) Contacts: Due to his professional status in Chile, he is on excellent
personal terms with all other newspaper publishers, correspondents and
editors. He also conducts a radio program and is accordingly well in-
formed in this field and has many radio contacts. In view of the fact
he originally published his newspaper in Valparaiso, he has many contacts
on the coast as well which should be important in this work.
4.) Personality: He is considered exceptional both in appearance and per
sonality and has easily acquired the confidence and friendship of
Chileans and Americans alike. Due to his wide interests, he is con-
sidered very well informed and cultured. His demeanor is always that of
a gentleman, yet he is capable of courageous action as evidenced by his
war experience and his conduct of assignments for this Station as indicated
below.
5) Intelligence experiences He was originally approved operationally to
handle the complex Soviet espionage case of FULMINATER-2. His conduct
of this case was considered excellent, and he displayed resourcefulness,
tact and ability to handle himself in difficult circumstances.
During the LCACTING operations of this Station involving the printing
of the posters, stickers, handbills and the "Communist Pig", this Station
called on FULMINATER-1 to do the job. It will be recalled that Head-
quarters was very pleased with the printing job in this project which
FULMINATER-1 had done. This particular project revealed FULMINATER-1'8
ability to handle ZACACTUS work effectively and with discretion as borne
out by the fact that the local Communists were never able to trace the
origin of this material.
o) Modus operandi:
1) Diplomatic covers It is suggested that ROSS be dosignated as the control

officer for ZACACTUS in Chile and that he maintain the official files,
funds and communications with ZACACTUS Headquarters.
2) ZACACTUS Field Operator: It is suggested that FULMINATER-1 be employed
on a regular State-side salary basis and that he be authorized a small
staff to assist him in the actual handling of all field projects. He
should have one officer assistant in a covert capacity and two stenog-
raphers, all of whom would be in his overt cover office, presumably as
his regular employees.
3) Cut-outs, agents, etc.: FULMINATER-1 should be authorized to develop
such cut-outs, agents, etc. as required to carry out his objectives in
Chile.
2. This Station is of the opinion that with the exception of possibly Mexico and
Venezuela, Chile is one of the most important Pa targets in Latin America.
The Communist influence in Chile is unquestionably a serious political factor,
and their propaganda is growing steadily throughout the country with extremely
little if any opposition. The present Communist drive towards nationalization
of the copper industry is gaining adherents daily and should be considered a.
potentially serious matter from the standpoint of our reliance on Chilean.
copper. Thus, it is the view of this Station that PW work is important in
Chile and that its initiation on a larger scale should not be unduly delayed.
It is also believed that considerable time, effort and money would be saved by
utilising the talent now in Chile, such as ROSS and FULMINATER-1, who already
have their feet on the ground and are ready to start.
3. In the case of ROSS, if Headquarters is interested, it should approach General
ACKERMAN direct in A-2. Regarding FULMINATER-1, a very tentative approach
has been made to sound him out, and he reacted very favorably although no
commitments were made as to salary or exact nature of the work. The moment for
a decision in his case is very opportune, as he is planning to sell his news-
paper and leave Chile for the United States or some other country. Recogniz-
ing the value his paper and presses would have to his cover and his work, be Hub
was asked, as mentioned above, to postpone selling his paper for thirty days. $10
It is believed that he would be an excellent person for ZACACTUS in Chile and
for future consideration as a Staff Officer. It is not believed that he would
be interested in any salary less than $5,000 per year although again, this
subject has not been discussed with him to date. It is urged, however, that
Headquarters cable this Station as early as practicable if there is any interest
in obtaining FULMINATER-l as proposed above.
