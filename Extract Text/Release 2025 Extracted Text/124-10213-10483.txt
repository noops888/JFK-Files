3. I doubt that Leal has been designated as the US representative for FIUR,
and do not believe that the documents he gave me originated in Cuba. I
suspect that another group of exiled Cuban politicians wrote the document
in the US, and are trying to get national publicity in publicity in order to get support.
I have recently heard that Eloy Gutierrez menoyo has been added to the list
of Cabinet appointments. I doubt very much that Gutierrez and Ray would be
fully accepted by the majority of Cubans in exile.
