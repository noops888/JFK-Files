Arthur G. VAI VADA-Request for KUCAGE Operational Clearance
It is requested that an operational clearance de obtained for VAIVADA
which will permit the Station to discuss with him KUCAGE operations in the
student field. We realize that VAIVADA is fully occupied with hispresent
duties, and it is not intended to place any responsibility on hin for KUCAGE
operations. It would be of great assistance to the Station, however, if the
writer could be permitted to obtain VALVADA's views on the type of KUCAGE
activity in the student field which might be most likely to succeed, ard
capitalize on his knowledge of the field by using him as a spotter. (we
have in mind the organization of a student political action team similar
to the one operating in frazil under project ALKALINE-C.)

REFS: (a) HKH-W-1607, 30 March 1956
(b) HKH-W-1505, 28 December 1955
Regarding reference (a) the Station concurs fully with the proposed promotion
of Arthur G. Vaivada and desires also at this time to bring to the attention
of Headquarters the merits of granting Vaivada staff status either
concurrently with the promotion or as soon thereafter as may prove feasible.
The agent himself has expressed a keen interest in acquiring such status,
for a number of obvious reasons. As a contract agent, Vaivada has not been
entitled to the standard step increases that accrue to regular GS employees
Horeover he has not had the benefit of recent legislative increases in basic
salary rates, such that his salary, originally set 16 August 1954 at the then
CS-9 level, is still $5060.00 per anmum. Perhaps of more importance than
the foregoing considerations is the fact that this agent has been and is
losing out in terms of the retirement, health insurance, and other more long-
term advantages available to staff personnel. The agent has several times
expressed to the case officer his concern, as a family man, over the fact that
he is not receiving retirement credits with his years of service. Vaivada's
expressed career interests lie in continued employment by KUBARK, more
especially in the area of unofficial cover assignments in the field, and in
view of his qualities of character and high level of performance for KUBARK
the Station has no hesitation in recommending to Headquarters that he be
awarded the desired change in status.
In view of the agent's present salary level it is recommended that the
promotion from his present grade be to the equivalent of a GS-10 at a per
anmum salary_of_v5,915.00. If Headquarters_concurs_in_the_recommendation-
that the agent be granted staff officer status, the agent would move up to
the GS-11 grade at that time.

1. The following information on Arthur G. VAIVADA is being forwarded
so that you may consider using him in Mexico City as a contact agent,
which capacity he has served KUFIRE most ably in the past four
years. His present contract, which became effective on 1 September 1953.
for a two year period, provides for a salary equivalent to grads
05-7, with allowances.
2. A review of the Headquarters file indicates that subject is an
aggressive, rather well qualified operative, who han enjoyed a goci
measure of success and has exercised good judgment under operational
stress. He desires a carser with this Agency, and is devoted to
the work. Subject's acedasic oncation has been designed to fit
him to becomes an economist. Prion to gutering a contract relation-
ship with KUPARK, subject had received. S. Army intelligence
training and had worked fer Air Force Intelligence in Panama. He
was trained covertly by Anstructors of WBARK in Washington, D.C.
in the latter part of 1953. His instructors indicate that they
were most favorably impressed and feel that he possesses a sound
practical knowledge of osaic clandestine operational principles
and should became an increasingly valuable agent in the long rangs
work of this organisation.

3. The following is a summary and appraisal of subject's work which has 13/X
been provided by the Costa Rican Desk at Headquarterss
a. He tas recited by the Panama station in November 1948, bus5
in early 1949 he moved to San Jose, Costa Rica, where he
enrolled in the University of Costa Rica as a student of
economics. In June-1949-subject acted as cutout-for-two
mail intercept agents and handled a low level panetration
of the Communist Party. In-October-1949-a-very-high-level
penetration of the Communist Party was also turned over
Das to the subject, who was by this time devoting approximately

half his tine to our work. Since that tise his mala
daties have been to act as cutout and direct these
agents. His most important single activity has been
debriefing the high-level penetration agent whom he has
been able to develop to a point where he end this one
agent constituted the most important assets to the
station.
b. In the course of his operational cuties, subject has
proved himself to be very secarity conscious and to
possess a degree of initiative which has impressed the
station chief on more than ons occasion. He has
participated in setting up safehovaós, vas responsible
for recruiting the two mail intercept agents, and has
provided the facilities for photographing the material
these two agents turn over to him for rapid processing
and return to normal mail chamels. Subject has
recruited tro additional agents, both of thus are
presently being used, and carried out a cold recruitment
attempt on a Communist. He participated in a technical
surveillance operation in early 1951 during which he was
in charge of the monitoring post together with an
indigenous agent under his direction.
:
c. Subject is an expert photographer and at one time operated
his own photography shop in San Jose. He is also fairly
proficient in sending Morse code, is trained in the use of
firearms and has studied and worked with charts and aspo.
He is considered an expert in writing reports. Sabjeet
has proved himself to be knowledgeable in the usual
techniques of covert operations after four years of working
in San Jose, and has proved to be invaluable to the
station in spotting and/or recruiting additional agents.
4. Subject will be available for duty in the near future. Should
you find his qualifications of interest and favor his entry
into Baxico as a contract agent, please advise as early as
possible. Dunshurst has requested that Subject's possible use
