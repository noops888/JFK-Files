The tems of the agreement include, he st teu, that he will provide
through his European contacts at least three pilo: instructors and three
mechanic instructors within thirty days. (Thirty days from when is an
open question) Hore instructors will be needed at a later date, the
possible total number being set at ten, five for flying and five for
mechanical instruction. These instructors will be paid 20,000 Belgian

this was promised to him, with other equipment, and though his targeting
has shifted he still has great use for it. Currently WIRCGUE has one of
the station beica's on short loan in order topirotogrash the Color
port facilities for PIERACT.
7. Recruited instructors should be provided a means of outside
contact with the Station separate from FIROGUE, which could be implementei
if needed, at a later date. The actual hiring and correspondence rela-

wish to commence repayment of the $4,000 loan made to him for his business.
Also, this particular situation could be fairly short-lived in view of
