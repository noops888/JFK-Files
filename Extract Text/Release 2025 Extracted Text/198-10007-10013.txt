led to postponement of the Congress.

bas presented legislative proposals to the Costa Rican Assembly
which will require ell persons intending to travel to Comunist
countries to have their travel approved by a newly created

through their areas, and to reject applications for such visas
except in certain special cases. Persons not possessing visas
