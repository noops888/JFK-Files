1. Please query Jerone H. EMISIS in regard to the location of the
1964 overt and covert tax returma and payment check in the acount of
$1774.00 of Edward G. TICHEORN and advise.
2. TICHEGEN states that he passed the only the copies of each return and
the check to FALSIS on 29 April 1965, Aurther stating that BALSIS told him he
would completely audit both returns to assure their accuracy in resari to
miteratical computations and application of tax liability. BALSIS was to
return a copy of the overt return for TICHEORI's retention.
3. A thorough search of Station files falled to uncover the subject
taz returns and check or any transmittal record of returns or payment.
4. Since TICHBOR will be extremely hard pressed to duplicate the returns
without a copy of the overt return, the location of the returns is very important.

1. Due to operational requirements a meeting was not
held with Edward G. TICHBORN by an Adain representative, how-
ever, the items noted below were briefly discussed with him
by telephone on 26 October.
2. TICHBORN was advised information would be forwarded
to the Station and, upon his return to the Station, he should
ask his contact about the items--both as a reminder and for
fuller explanation. As will be noted, there is a time element
concerned with c. below.
a. Reference A (Transmittal of hospitalization claim).
TICHBORN asked about the claim and was advised the dia-
patch was received 5 October and the separate cover was
received by the insurance Branch on 25 October. The ine-
surance section has agreed to expedite the claim and it
is expected Pinence will advise the Station of the amount
of reimbursement to TICHBOR!! within the next two-threo
weeks.
b. Reference B (Concerned signing the contract anend-
sent forwarded by Book Dispatch 5178). The provisions of
the BD regarding signing the amendment still pertain. The
subject was very briefly but, by no meatis thoroughly, ex-
plained. In this connection, it had been planned to have
him read the two attached pamphlets "Your Social Security"
and Social Security Amendments--1965". If cover or oper-
ational considerations do not preclude, the pamphlets may
de given to TICHSORN to either read and return to the
Station or to retain.

c. Reference C (Transmitted Income Tax information
in response to Book Dispatch 4659), The Tax Committee
was checked regarding TICHBORS and advised they needed
additional explanatory information from TICHBORN prior
to being able to compute an Assessment and bring hla
under the revised tax procedures. TICHBORS could not
recall sufficient facts and figures to provide the re-
quired information, lie was therefore advised it pas to
his benefit to subalt the information to the Station as
soon after his return as practicable.
(1) Otter Income. He had indicated receipt of
fees but did not state whether they were the resuit
of work outside the U.S. or if they were received while
in, and as a result of work in the U.S. If the fees
were earned as a result of work outside the U.S.,
they are excludable for federal tax purposes.
It
(2) itemized Deductions. He had indicated under
"other" $1400. but did not provide any breakdown or
explanation as to what the acount represented.
18 necessary to provide sufficient supporting infors-
ation to enable the Cosoittee to recognize the amunt
as an allowable ites. He also inmilcated a loss of
$2,000 on investments. Explanatory facts are required
such aso-mazes, when, reason for the loan (sale of
stock at $XX versus cost of SEX or whatever), whether
the loss was a carryover frua prior year(a), etc. It
is better that too much information be provided rather
than too little.
PICHEORN is to provide the taformation in writing with
his certification as to completeness and accuracy for trans-
mittal to lHeadquarters. If the information is received
within the first part of November it is like'y the re-
