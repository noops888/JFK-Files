5. SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGEABILITY:
A. WASH-32615 APPARENTLY HAS LIMITED
KNOWLEDGEABILITY ABOUT THE GORIZONT PLANT, WHERE SHE WORKED
FOR 25 YEARS, FROM 1966-1991, FIRST AS A TIMEKEEPER AND LATER
AS A TELEVISION SET FINAL TEST TECHNICIAN. WHEN SOURCE FIRST
WENT TO WORK IN THE GORIZONT PLANT IN 1966, IT WAS STILL KNOWN
*AS THE MINSK RADIO PLANT. REPORTEDLY, <LEE HARVEY OSWALD>
WORKED AT THE PLANT WHEN HE LIVED IN MINSK DURING 1959-1960.
THE PLANT MADE MANY ELECTRICAL SPARE PARTS AND PRINTED CIRCUIT
BOARDS FOR THE MILITARY. BY 1972 THE PLANT HAD EXPANDED ITS
FACILITIES TO COVER TWO CITY BLOCKS, AND EMPLOYED ABOUT 10,000
PEOPLE. IN 1972, SOON AFTER IT COMPLETED A NEW SHOP WHICH
MADE WOODEN T.V. CABINETS, AN EXPLOSION AND SUBSEQUENT FIRE
TOTALLY DESTROYED THE T.V. SHOP. ÚLTIMATELY, THE 51
CENTIMETER (CM) T.V. SET THE PLANT MADE PROVED TO BE LIKE ONE
OF THE BEST QUALITY T.V. SETS IN THE U.S. IN THE EARLY 1970S
THE PLANT MADE SOME TYPES OF SECRET MICROELECTRONIC PRINTED
CIRCUITS WHICH REPORTEDLY WERE USED IN ROCKETS.
WASH-32615
KNEW NO DETAILS OF THIS WORK.
B. WASH-32615 CLAIMS SHE TRIED NOT BE BECOME
INVOLVED IN ANY TYPE OF SECRET WORK AT GORIZONT.
INDEED, SHE
NEVER HAD A SECRET CLEARANCE. BY 1990 ORDERS FOR THE SECRET
MICROELECTRONIC ITEMS MADE IN SHOP NO. 6 OF THE PLANT WERE
CANCELLED, AND MANY COOPERATIVES WERE STARTED IN THE PLANT.
SHE WORKED IN ONE OF THESE COOPERATIVES, IN THE T.V. SHOP,
WHERE ABOUT 50 EMPLOYEES REMAINED. THESE 50 EMPLOYEES WORKED
SEVERAL DAYS A WEEK, WHENEVER SPARE PARTS WHICH NORMALLY CAME
FROM MANY PLACES IN THE FSU WERE NO LONGER AVAILABLE. THE
COOPERATIVE IN THE T.V. SHOP WAS CALLED "PRAGMA." IT WAS
ORGANIZED BY IGOR ((PITKEVICH)), WHO EXPANDED PRAGMA'S WORK
BEYOND T.V. SETS, TO DEALING IN COMMODITIES AND RAISING AND
SELLING VEGETABLES AND LIVESTOCK. BY EARLY 1991, NO MORE SPARE
PARTS WERE LEFT TO MAKE T.V. SETS, AND ALL MILITARY WORK AT THE
GORIZONT HAD STOPPED. BY AUGUST 1991, WASH-32615 HAD BEEN
FORCIBLY RETIRED. HER RETIREMENT PAY WAS A PALTRY 1,500
RUBLES A MONTH. THE RAPIDLY INCREASING PRICE OF FOOD SOON ATE
UP HER PENSION PAYMENTS. HER FAMILY SURVIVED ONLY BECAUSE SHE
WAS ABLE TO RAISE SOME FOOD ON THE PLOT OF LAND SHE HAD BOUGHT
IN 1989.
