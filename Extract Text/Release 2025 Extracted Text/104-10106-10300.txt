Yurily Ivanovich NOSENKO
ORISINA
IDENTIFICATION:
NOSENKO, Yurily Ivanovich, a Soviet
KGB officer who defected in 1964 and
was subsequently involuntarily con-
fined in the U.S. by the Agency for
a period of approximately three years.
BACKGROUND
:
APPROVAL
:
NOSENKO first contacted Agency per-
sonnel in Switzerland in June 1962
and subsequently defected in January
1964. NOSENKO was brought to the U.S.
and after a period of relative freedom
he was involuntarily confined in
April 1964. From April 1964 to
August 1965, he was confined at an
Agency controlled site in Clinton,
Maryland. From August 1965 to
October 1967, NOSENKO was confined
at Camp Peary Virginia. In October
1967, he was returned to the Washington
area, given increasing amounts of
freedom until he was given total free-
dom in April 1969. NOSENKO became a
U.S. citizen in April 1974. NOSENKO
was employed by the Agency as a
consultant in March 1969 and continues
under contract to date. His present
salary is $23,500 per year.
(1) The legal basis to confine NOSENKO
against his will was discussed by
Mr. Richard Helms, DD/P, and others with
the Deputy Attorney General on 2 April
1964 (Tab 1). On 3 April 1964, the
Agency General Counsel, Mr. Lawrence
Houston, advised the Director of Security
by memorandum that such confinement was
proper (Tab 2).
(2) There are a series of letters from
the DDCI, DCI and others to various
agencies, including the Department of
Justice and the White House, covering
the period 1964 to 1969, evidencing
awareness of these agencies of the
NOSENKO affair (Tab 3).
(3) The conditions of NOSENKO's confine-
ment were established by the Office of
Security (Tabs 4 & 5).

TERMINATION :
COMMENTS
:
By memorandum dated 2 October 1968,
the Director of Security forwarded
two reports to the DDCI summarizing.
the results of the NOSENKO case to
that date. The reports are voluminous.
One was prepared by the Office of
Security and the other by the FBI.
Both reports conclude that NOSENKO
was a bona fide defector. A draft
memorandum attached to this file,
dated 21 October 1968 and prepared
by the CI Staff, raises question
regarding NOSENKO's bona fides
and challenges the above two reports.
NOSENKO Continues under contract to
the Agency. He is brought to Washington,
periodically to consult on matters
germane to his background and experience.
Various reports are available in the
files of the Office of Security which
detail financial aspects of this case.
No final accounting has been made since
the project continues.
(1) While the Office of Security files
do document the rationale for the original
confinement of NOSENKO, they do not
document the rationale for his continued
confinement over so long a period of time.
A memorandum dated 5 August 1969 states
that various congressional staff officers
were briefed on NOSENKO and states that
concern for his safety, as well as con-
cern regarding his bona fides, prompted
the prolonged confinement. (See Tab 6)
(2) Office of Security files document
a period in 1969 during which a mail
cover was placed on NOSENKO.
(3) During the above period, NOSENKO
was allowed a pleasure trip to Florida.
During this trip, Agency personnel, with
apparent Headquarters approval, obtained
the services of prostitutes. This
apparently occurred on at least two
occasions.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD
SUSJECT:
Discussion. with Deputy Attorney
General on Nosenko Case
I. Ar Helas, Mr. Houston and Mr. Murphy met with
the Deputy Attorney General and members of his staff to
discuss subject case. Present from Hr. Katzenbach's--
staff were Messrs. Foley, Yeagley and Reis.
2. Mr. Helas explained the Nosenko case briefly
and indicated that shortly we would be faced with what
we at least considered to be two problems on which we
would like the advice of the Department of Justice.
First, we would seeon feel compelled to begin hostile
interrogation of Hosenko in order to arrive at the truth
with respect to his mission for the KGB and we wondered
what the legal position would be in circumstances in
which we detained Nosenko against his will for this pur-
pose. Second, we would have to be ready after determin-
ing that we could obtain no additional information from
Nosenko to deport him. We had thought of taking him to
Germany and transferring him to Soviat custody in Borlin
where this has been done a number of times in the past.
:
3. There was some discussion of whether deportation
to another country might be a consideration. Mr. Halms
explained we would probably face publicity problems in
deporting to a third country of the kind we would en-
counter if he were free in the U. S. Nr. Helms noted
there were many items of information which we and the
FBI realize are of no significance because of the file
holdings we have but which an unscrupulous newspaper man
could use to create mischief. This aspect was then dropped
and it was the consensus that Berlin was probably the best
place.
4. The question of the basis for detention was again
raised and related by Mr. Foley to the conditions under
which Nosenko is in this country. He is hore as an "ex-
clusion and parole case" which means he has not been
admitted and has been paroled to the Agency which is
responsible for him while he is in this country.

parole can be interpreted to mean parole to a specific
locale which would provide some justification for our
detaining him for questioning. It was then pointed out,
however, that if he said he wished to leave the country
to return to the Soviet Union, technically we would not
be able to detain him further. In this event, we would
be faced with the need to deport his quickly and quietly
and for this purpose the immigration warrant of arrest.
and deportation was was probably the best instrument.
5. Mr. Katzenbach asked Mr. Foley to check into
this and Hr. Foley will in turn contact Mr. Houston.
Mr. Houston will in turn discuss the problem with CIA
Office of Security officials to get the background-of
their liaison with the INS on these matters.
6. Mr. Helas thanked. Mr. Katzenbach for his assistance
and wo departed amid some jovial banter with respect to
"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold" about what we expected
to happen to him when he started to climb over that "wall"
in Berlin.

MEMORANDUM FOR: : Director of Security
SUBJECT:

Parole Status of Defectors
:
1. On 2 April 1964 we had a discussion with the Department
of Justice or the status of aliens whose inspection by I&NS is deferred
upon arrival at our request and who are then paroled to this Agency.
It was the position of the Department of Justice that we were responsible
for taking any action necessary to carry out the terms of the parole.
2. As you know, a basic parole agreement was executed by the
Attorney General and the DCI on 10 February 1955. After setting up
conditions for authorizing parole in any one case, the agreement states:
"After parole of such aliens, the Central Intelligence Agency will assume
responsibility for care, supervision and control of a kind and degree it
believes consistent with the internal security needs of the United States
during continuance of their parole status." This means that the
responsible Agency officials must take the minimum action necessary
to protect the internal security needs of the United States. The word
"minimum" is not necessarily a limitation. It merely means that good
judgment must be used as to what kind and degree of action is necessary.
3. The agreement further provides that upon completion of the
parolee's intelligence or operational purposes in the United States or if
internal security reasons so require, the alien will be removed from
this country through arrangements made by the Agency and, in such
case, the Agency will inform the Service in advance of each proposed
departure.

went which permitted his to carry out intelligence and Y
security functions in Geneva on behalf of the ECB
..
:
3. HOSENKO also attended various sessions of the
Disarmament Conference hold in Genova in 1962. During
the course of these sessions NOSENKO sought contact with
officials of the U. S. Government, informed these officials
that he was affiliated with the Soviet State Security ap-
paratus and volunteered to aid the U. S. Government in
datecting Soviet subversive activity directed against the
U, S. Government. During the course of his contact with
U. S. authorities NOSENKO stated that bis cooperation with.
the U. S. Government originated with his distaste and hatred
for the Soviet regime in general, with his desire to obtain
revenge for the unjust death of his father, a senior official
in the Soviet shipbuilding industry, and with the general
admiration of the Azericans with whom he had come in con-
tact within the Soviet Union.
4. In lato January 1964, NOSENKO arrived in Geneva,
again masquerading as a member of the Soviet delegation
to the Disaranment Conference. Subject secretly notified
his CIA contacts in the United States concerning his pres-
ence in Geneva and arranged to meet with these contacts..
During a series of sootings NOSENKO provided information
including documents concerning Soviet Stato Security acti-
vities within the USSR SR and abroad and a detailed account
of the XC3 operation against U. S. Professor Barghoora
which NOSENKO said he had personally supervised at the
direction of SEMICHASTNIY, the Chairman of the Committee
for State Security (KG3).

1964, at which the following were present: Messrs. Charles Kane,
Jack Bauman, OS; Dr. Charles Bohrer, Medical Staff; Messrs.
Bagley, Karpovich), McMahon and David Murphy, SR Division.
2. The essence of this meeting was furnished to the Acting.
Chief, Support Branch on 12 May 1964, as follows:
Effective immediately or as soon as practicable, the following
procedures will apply with regard to the handling of the
Subject
(1) Subject will receive a regular diet with modest regulated.
portions. He is to have no dessertor or "trimmings,"
but may have have the necessary silverware with which to
eat properly. (CAUTION--Extreme care should be
exercised with regard to controlling the silverware,
and it it was suggested that at least two of the guards
be required to count the silverware in and out; that..
the silverware be placed on the tray in a manner
where it could be observed before the guards enter
the room, etc.)
:
(2) Arrangements are to be made for the installation of
adequate air-conditioning equipment to insure that a
comfortable temperature is maintained. (It is under-
stood that there is quite a bit of equipment available
through Logistics channels.)
:
(3) Subject is to receive a bath; change of underwear;
change of uniform; and a change of linen for his bed.

(4) Subject is to receive a haircut, the shorter the better.
(5) Subject is to receive one cigarette on 12 May 1964.
(NOTE--These changes with regard to the bath, haircut,
cigarette are not to be considered as something to be
done on a regular schedule. We will await specific
instructions from SR Division as to when these items
are to be accomplished in the future.)
(6) Effective immediately, Dr. Bohrer will visit the
Subject only on Tuesday each week.
(7) In addition to the above, it must be emphasized that
our attitude toward the Subject will remain precisely
the same, and our security procedures, including
searches, will continue to be at maximum control.
:
3. It was further ascertained that we will have custody of
the Subject until at least July. It was suggested that perhaps we may
wish to explore some modifications in the assignment of personnel
or schedule of assignments. In addition, the Acting Chief, Support
Branch has suggested that immediate consideration be given to
devising necessary procedures to be followed in the event of an
emergency involving loss of control of the Subject. This should
be discussed immediately with the responsible DFO supervisors
and specific procedures devised, and all guards properly informed
as to their responsibilities in this matter.
