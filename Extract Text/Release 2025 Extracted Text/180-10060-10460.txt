Assassination Records Review Board
Final Determination Notification
AGENCY : HSCA
RECORD NUMBER : 180-10060-10460
RECORD SERIES : STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS
AGENCY FILE NUMBER :
December 8, 1995
Status of Document:
Postponed in Part
Number of releases of previously postponed information: 7
Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors
including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the
absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.
Number of Postponements: 2
Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.
Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could
reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of
privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Dear Congressman Edgar:
On your recent trip to Canada, Mel Kreidman did
not realize that under the House Rules, we cannot reimburse
him for expenses paid for another.
Consequently, we prepared a voucher for $75.00 in your
name for the expenses paid by Kreidman.
When you receive the check, you should endorse it over
to Kreidman so that he will be reimbursed.
Have your office give me a call if you have any questions.
Sincerely,
Jon
Thomas Howarth
Budget Officer
