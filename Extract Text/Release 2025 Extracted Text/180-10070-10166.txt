MEMORANDUM
TO: TOM LAMBETH
FROM: KENNETH D. KLEIN
DATE: JUNE 16, 1977
RE: BILL TRIPLETT
It is my recommendation that Bill Triplett
be hired as a staff counsel. I interviewed
him approximately 5 months ago and he is far
superior to almost all of the applicants I have
interviewed. His legal background is excellent
for our purposes. He has experience as a pro-
secutor, a defense lawyer and as an investigator.
He impressed me as being intelligent, well spoken
and as having an easy going manner.
He desires to leave his present position with LEAA
due to the lack of challenge. I am certain that
this Committee would be gaining a productive member
by hiring Mr. Triplett.
