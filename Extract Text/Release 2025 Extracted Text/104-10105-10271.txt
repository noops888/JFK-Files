to whom. Draw a line across column after each comment.)
1.
Attached is an ad-
vance informal copy of our
proposed security deletions
and revisions of the Hunt
galley proof. Please note
that this list has not yet
been reviewed by Mr. Blee
and is, therefore, still
subject to change.
2. The DDO panel that
reviewed the Hunt manuscript
has designated items, numbered
12, 14, 19, 21, 24 and 25, as
"hard core," by which we mean
that the Agency should insist
on their deletion or revision
and be prepared to obtain an
injunction and engage in
litigation should Hunt refuse
to cooperate.

Page 59, line 38 beginning with "However" and ending
on page 60, line 2 with "milieu". Rutherford T. "Pinky" Walsh
retired under cover and his CIA relationship should not bald
exposed. His assignment in Paris under student cover/is
similarly classified. The description of this activity just
a couple of pages before the author gratuitously mentions the
advisene
lack of an agreement between the Agency and the French barring (DA)
unilateral operations in France) (Item 4 below) is potentially
an additionally damaging blow to liaison relationships. (Page

3. Page 63, line 21; the name "Frank Holcomb"
Mr. Holcomb retired under cover and his past relationship
with the CIA should not be exposed. It is additionally
recommended that the entire paragraph wherein Mr. Holcomb's

knowledges CIA operations in support of anti-communist political
operations in Italy. (page 105, lines 18-21.)
4.
Page 63, line 30 beginning with "By" and ending with V.A.
"arrangement" on line 33, page 63. It is recommended that this
passage be deleted since its inclusion not only is not pertinent
2Yto the narrative but it unnecessarily jars, liaison with the
British and is an implied insult to the French/liaison services.
(page 106, lines 4-7.)
5. Page 66 beginning with "Finis" on line 24 and ending
with "world" on line 27. This passage describes a specific CIA

6. Page 68, the pseudonym "John F. Rittenhouse" on line 34.
The author's original CIA pseudonym was classified, and even
though compromised, never appeared in the press and still exists
on various currently classified documents. (page 114, line 23.)
7. Page 71, beginning with "Spanish" on line 28 and ending
with "America" on line 20, page 72, and including the footnotes
on pages 71 and 72. This passage should be deleted because it
describes the Agency's role in subsidizing, producing and dis-
24 tributing "El Campesino's" book, Life and Death in the USSR.

8. Page 72 beginning with "Eudocia" on line 21 and ending
with "Scribner's" on line 32. This should be deleted because
it describes the Agency's role in the translation, publishing 24
and distribution of Eudocio Ravines' book, The Yenan Way.
It
also describes William Buckley's role in that operation as a
CIA officer. (Page 121, lines 17-23 and page 122, lines 1-6.)
9. Page 73 beginning with "Mexican" on line 5 through
"Rivera" on line 8. This should be deleted because it not only

11. Page 73 beginning with "cover" on line 17 through
"legend" on line 19. This should be deleted because it identifies.
a CIA-sponsored cover arrangement in Bangkok. Furthermore, thig
particular type of cover, the movie industry, has figured in
earlier unfavorable publicity to CIA in other Southeast Asian
countries and thus serves to further render suspect the use of
such cover in still other areas. (Page 123, lines 10-12.)
12. Page 73 beginning with "planned" on line 22 through
"authentic" on line 5 of page 74 and including the footnote on
page 74. This should be deleted because it describes a specific
operation involving the forgery of a page of the Shanghai Post,
and also includes descriptions of sources and methods. (Page 123,
lines 15-23 and all of page 124 including footnote.)
13. Page 77 beginning with "technical" on line 19 through
"station" on line 21. This should be deleted because it describes
and authenticates a CIA operation. (Page 131, lines 2-4.)
14. Page 80 beginning with "surreptitious-entry" on line 9
through "Embassy" on line 12, page 82. This should be deleted
because it describes a specific, sensitive operation as well aszy

identifies a specific operation and the foreign assets involved
in its support. (Page 147, lines 6-8.)
16. Page 95 beginning with "quasi-military" on line 11
through "East" on line 16. This should be deleted because it
describes various cover and support facilities used in Far East
Asian countries. (Page 163, lines 6-11.)
17. Page 95 beginning with "Hong Kong" on line 16 through
"Branch" on line 19. This should be deleted because it describes
an operation conducted jointly with a liaison service in Hong

damaging to current American detente efforts but is particularly
menacing to Hong Kong authorities in view of their proximity and
susceptibility to potential Chinese retaliatory pressures.

Page 123 beginning with "Soon" on line 12 through
"Madrid" on line 35. This passage deals with the author's work
on several "Peter Ward" books and, later, his assignment to
Madrid. It is recommended that OGC's/attention be called to
this passage. (Page 212, last line through page 213, lines 1-23.)
29. Page 126 beginning with "Chief" on last line through
"officers" on page 127, line 5. This passage should be deleted
because it specifies the classified activities of a CIA officer,
Roger Goiran 03, His assignments in Tehran and Brussels), as well
as his involvement in the compilation of a classified "encyclopedic
study" are unwarranted disclosures of Agency methods. (Page 219,
lines 8-13.)
30. Page 130 beginning with "Free" on line 20 through "CIA"
on line 21. This phrase should be deleted because it could serve
to affect the life of one of the principals of the Free Cuba
Committee, Mrs. Marieda Bourgin, gin, a former witting contact, who
is now employed by the State Department. (Page 225, lines 10-11.)
31. Page 150, all of lines 14 through 16. It would appear
that this description of the author's contact with Dr. Barney
Malloy of CIA is very unfair to the latter. It implies that
Hunt had a special relationship with Dr. Malloy and an effort
ought to be made by OGC to have the author rewrite this version
in order to reflect Dr. Malloy's true role in this affair.

cludes loose language which implies that still another set of
documents was prepared by the CIA for Hunt's use

Congressional "Watergate hearings". As such this is misleading
and could serve to create additional difficulties for the Agency.
It is recommended that the OGC make an effort to have the author

language be removed from his manuscript. (Page 387, lines 4-9.)
