Re: The Central Intelligence Agency's Compliance with the JFK Assassination
Records Collection Act, 44 U.S.C. § 2107
Dear Mr. Deutch:
Since 1994, the Assassination Records Review Board ("Review Board") has been
working with a number of Federal agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency,
to locate and publicly release records related to the assassination of President Kennedy.
These actions have been taken pursuant to The President John F. Kennedy
Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994) ("JFK
Act"). We have been working with Mr. John Pereira, Chief, Historical Review Group
and Mr. Barry Harrelson, Senior Review Officer, Historical Review Group of CIA and
have appreciated the cooperation we have received.
The purpose of this letter is to request your agency's cooperation in assisting the
Review Board in discharging its responsibility of assuring Congress and the American
people that the goals of the JFK Act have been accomplished to the greatest reasonable
extent. We want to assure the American people that the United States Government has
identified, located, and released all records relating to the assassination of President
Kennedy. Indeed, one of the paramount purposes of the JFK Act is to certify to the
public that the United States Government is not withholding relevant materials related
to the assassination. See, e.g., Assassination Materials Disclosure Act, H. R. Rep. No. 102-
625, Part 1, 102d Cong. 2d Sess. (1992) ("The Federal Government's failure to release
official materials has contributed to numerous conspiracy theories and fueled charges of
government complicity in the assassination... a salutary purpose is served in opening
these files (relating to the JFK assassination ] to allay the suspicion of government
cover-up.").

The Review Board has recently considered how it, along with the relevant federal
agencies, can best demonstrate to the American public that a thorough, good faith, and
diligent effort has been made to locate and release all remaining assassination-related
records within the control of the United States Government (and that the Government is
not hiding any such materials from public disclosure). Pursuant to the Congressional
mandate under the JFK Act to "create an enforceable, independent, and accountable
process for the public disclosure of such records," 44 U.S.C. § 2107(2)(a)(3), the Review
Board seeks to have the relevant federal agencies provide a complete and specific
accounting of their efforts to locate and release assassination-related records, including
a full explanation for any destruction of such records.
j
Accordingly, the Review Board requests that each relevant agency adhere to the formal
compliance program (hereinafter "JFK Act Compliance Program") outlined below and
devised by the Review Board pursuant to its powers under Section 7(j)(1)(A), (B), (C),
(D), and (F) of the JFK Act. We hereby request that you undertake the following
measures by the dates provided (these dates were set in view of the fact that the
Review Board's operations currently are scheduled to expire on September 30, 1997):
1.
Designation of Agency Compliance Official (or officials) and statement of
intent to comply with the JFK Act. We request that by December 9, 1996,
your agency designate an Agency Compliance Official who ultimately will
be responsible for ensuring that the agency has complied with its
obligations under the JFK Act, including the identification, location, and
organization of assassination records and the transmission of those
records to the National Archives and Records Administration ("National
Archives"). Although the Review Board assumes that Mr. John Pereira or
Mr. Barry Harrelson will serve in this position, we nevertheless await
your formal confirmation. If necessary, your agency may designate
additional persons with knowledge of the measures that have been
undertaken to locate assassination records.
We also request that by December 9, 1996, the agency convey its
agreement to adhere to the compliance procedure described below in this letter.
To the extent that any compliance procedure described below appears to
be unreasonable or to present difficulties that we may not have
anticipated, please explain why and make alternate suggestions to us.
2.
Initial Statement of Compliance. We request that the Agency Compliance
Official prepare, by January 6, 1997, an initial written statement of the
13-00000
The Honorable John M. Deutch
November 27, 1996
Page 3
agency's compliance with the JFK Act ("Statement of Compliance"),
setting forth the steps that the agency has taken to locate and process
assassination records. The Review Board recognizes that many of the
relevant federal agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency, have
previously written letters to the Review Board apprising it of their
progress at various stages of identifying and processing assassination
records under the JFK Act. The Statement of Compliance, while it may
include information previously reported to the Board, is to be the agency's
comprehensive and final report to the American public of what it has
done to locate records relating to the assassination. This Statement of
Compliance shall include, to the fullest reasonable extent, the following
information:
a.
b.
A complete description of all steps that your agency took to
identify and locate assassination records including, but not limited
to, an identification of the major record collections and files that
were consulted in the agency's search, any departmental file
indices consulted, the names and titles of the persons who were
responsible for conducting the searches, the physical locations of
the records that were searched, the off-site storage facilities (e.g.,
Federal Records Centers) searched, the specific steps that were
taken to locate and retrieve materials in archives, and any other
criteria used by the agency to locate assassination records,
A description of the steps that the agency took in direct response to
specific requests of the Review Board to locate certain additional
records or information relating to the assassination. In particular,
we ask that the CIA describe what specific steps it has taken to
address the following requests: CIA-9, Publications and Analytical
Materials (See David G. Marwell letter dated March 6, 1996 to Mr.
John Pereira); CIA-11, Silvia Duran's Original Statement (See David
G. Marwell letter dated May 3, 1996 to Mr. John Pereira); CIA-12,
JMWAVE Materials (See David G. Marwell letter dated May 22,
1996 to Mr. John Pereira); for HTLINGUAL records (See T. Jeremy
Gunn Memorandum dated October 1, 1996 to Mr. Barry Harrelson);
and for Monthly Operational Reports on Cuban Exile Groups (See
Manuel E. Legaspi Memorandum dated October 17, 1996 to Mr.
Barry Harrelson).

C.
To the extent that any assassination-related records have been
destroyed by the agency or any agency official, a full and specific
explanation of the circumstances surrounding the destruction of
such records.
d.
The status of remaining work that you can now identify that needs
to be completed by your agency in order to comply fully with the
JFK Act, including an identification of the categories of records
that must be processed and transmitted to the National Archives, a
description of any additional searches for files that must be done,
and the projected date(s) for completion of these tasks.
3.
Review Board Interview With Agency Compliance Official (or Officials).
Shortly after the submission of the agency's written Statement of
Compliance, we ask that the Agency Compliance Official (as well as any
persons who helped prepare the agency's initial Statement of
Compliance) be made available to the Review Board for an interview
regarding the location of agency assassination records. The interview will
be used as an opportunity to resolve any outstanding questions regarding
the agency's search, including any follow-up tasks to be completed by the
agency. The Review Board anticipates that these interviews will be
conducted in January 1997.
4.
Submission of Final Agency Declaration of Compliance. By July 1, 1997,
Federal agencies are expected to complete the process of identification,
location, and declassification of its assassination records at which time
they should submit to the Review Board a final declaration certifying,
under oath, their compliance with the provisions of the JFK Act (the "Final
Declaration of Compliance"). Because of the volume of CIA records, such
a "final" statement may not be practicable at that time. However, we do
expect that CIA will provide a complete status appraisal by July 1, 1997.
This final declaration shall set forth all of the information initially set forth
in the initial Statement of Compliance and shall also supplement the initial
Statement of Compliance by detailing any further steps-that were
conducted by the agency in identifying and locating assassination records.
The agencies' Final Declarations of Compliance will be included in our
final report to Congress.

5.
Compliance Depositions. Starting on or about August 1, 1997, the Review
Board, pursuant to its statutory authority, may conduct depositions,
under oath, of the Agency Compliance Official along with any other
agency officials with responsibility for complying with the JFK Act. The
decision to take a compliance deposition of an agency will be made on a
case by case basis, taking into account the importance of the agency to the
work of the JFK Act and the sufficiency of the agency's efforts to account
fully for its compliance with the JFK Act. In the event that the Review
Board decides to commence a compliance deposition of an agency, the
responsible agency designee(s) will be expected to testify under oath with
respect to any and all issues relating to the agency's record search,
including the scope of the search, the identity of filès searched, the
destruction of any relevant records, and any other matters set forth in the
Final Declaration of Compliance. Any person obligated to appear for a
deposition under oath shall be fully entitled to obtain legal representation.
We look forward to receiving your initial response, by December 9, that designates your
Agency Compliance Official and includes your statement regarding your position with
respect to the provisions outlined in this letter. To the extent that you have any
questions or suggestions regarding the Compliance Program, please do not hesitate to
contact our General Counsel, T. Jeremy Gunn, at (202) 724-0088.
Thank you for your cooperation with our work.

David G. Marwell
Executive Director
Assassination Records Review Board
600 E Street N.W., 2nd Floor
Washington D.C. 20530
Dear Mr. Marwell:
The Director of Central Intelligence has forwarded to
me your 27 November 1996 letter for response. I commend the
efforts of the Review Board and its staff in reviewing and
releasing hundreds of thousands of United States Government
documents for greater public understanding about the
assassination of President Kennedy. I also confirm the
Central Intelligence Agency's commitment to continue working
closely with the Review Board in carrying out its statutory
authorities.
With regard to the requests made in your letter, I
understand the Review Board's desire to demonstrate to the
public that it has carried out its duties thoroughly and
diligently. You have requested that CIA appoint an Agency
Compliance Official to be responsible for ensuring CIA's
compliance with its obligations under the JFK Act.
The DCI
has full confidence in Mr. John Pereira as Chief of the
Historical Review Group (HRG) and has determined that Mr.
Pereira will continue to act as the CIA official responsible
for ensuring full compliance with the JFK Act and will
remain the Agency's focal point with the Review Board.
You have also requested that CIA provide an Initial
Statement of Compliance. Mr. Pereira and Mr. Barry
Harrelson, the senior review officer for HRG, as well as the
rest of the HRG staff, have always been available to you
without restriction. The Review Board and your staff have
been provided access to any relevant documents or
information you have requested. As you know, the Review
Board was fully informed as to the steps CIA took to
designate Agency records as part of the President Kennedy
collection. HRG has also arranged for multiple briefings by
senior CIA officials from a wide variety of CIA components
so that the Review Board can better understand the
information it is reviewing. Given the current effective
relationship between HRG and your staff, should you require
additional assurances of this Agency's compliance with the
JFK Act, I suggest that you contact Messrs. Pereira and
13-00000
DEC 09 '96 03:17PM
David G. Marwel1
Harrelson directly. As usual, they will provide you with
the specific information you need as quickly as possible to
continue to record CIA's compliance with the JFK Act.
As to your request for a complete description of the
steps CIA has taken to respond to specific requests, I
understand that there are several outstanding requests. HRG
has assured me that these requests have been discussed with
your staff and responses will be provided to you as quickly
as possible. Given the number and breadth of the requests
that are being made by the Review Board and the limited
staff resources available to CIA to process such requests, I
ask that the Review Board continue to prioritize all its
requests for information or documents. With the Review
Board's priorities established in this way, the Agency can
immediately work on those requests that are most important
to the Review Board. Of course, as CIA responds to these
requests, HRG will provide any information the Review Board
needs as to how the searches were conducted. I believe that
this method will best meet the needs of the Review Board and
will allocate CIA's limited resources in the most efficient
manner possible.
Finally, as to your requests to interview CIA officials
responsible for this Agency's compliance with the JFK Act,
Mr. Pereira has always been available to the Review Board
for informal discussions as well as for giving sworn
testimony including depositions. CIA has never objected to
the Review Board deposing or interviewing informally any of
its current or former employees and has, in fact,
facilitated such interviews. You will also recall that, on
6 August 1996, Messrs. Pereira and Harrelson gave sworn
testimony at an open hearing of the Review Board.
I trust that this responds to the concerns raised in
your letter. Of course, if you should have any questions
regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact
Linda C. Cipriani, an attorney in the Office of General
Counsel, at (703) 874-3124.
With every good wish, I am
Sincerely yours,

Re: Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board's Compliance
Program and Requests for Additional Information and Records
Dear Barry:
I am writing to memorialize the Review Board's understanding of the status of CIA's
responses to our formal and informal requests for additional information and records
that have been requested pursuant to the Review Board's authority under Section
7(j)(1)(C)(ii) of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of
1992, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994) (JFK Act).
It is important that everyone at the Agency who is responsible for providing answers to
our requests for additional information and records understand that the answers will
need to be incorporated by reference into the Agency's Final Compliance Statement.
Essentially, CIA will need to attest, under oath, that it has made all reasonable and
diligent searches and that its answers are true and correct to the extent of the best,
reasonably available information. In this regard, is important to note that when the
Review Board requests, for example, a 201 file, it is not asking that you identify relevant
records within the Sequestered Collection. Rather, it is asking to review the original
201 file in its current and most complete version.¹
¹The Review Board has no basis for assuming that a 201 file as it appears in the
Sequestered Collection today is necessarily complete. It is fully possible that a relevant
document was not identified by CIA or the HSCA in 1978-79 and therefore is not
included in the Sequestered Collection, or that a relevant document that was initially
placed in the Sequestered Collection in 1978-79 may have been misplaced at some point
during the subsequent twenty years. Therefore, in response to requests for files, it is
not sufficient merely to point to places where responsive records appear in the
Collection. On a case-by-case basis, we are very willing to hear your explanations for
the possible burdensomeness of any particular search or your analysis of why a search

As we have written in our formal requests and as we have said to you orally, you
should interpret our requests in the broadest reasonable sense. However, to the extent
that you believe that a request poses an unreasonable burden that we may not have
anticipated, or to the extent that you have suggestions to modify or to amend our
requests in such a way as to better reach our goals, you should not hesitate to make
suggestions or seek clarification. However, unless we specifically hear from you to the
contrary, it is our presumption that CIA will respond fully to the requests as posed.
In response to your request, the ARRB staff has now identified six of our outstanding
requests as high priority issues. We would appreciate your forwarding to us as much
responsive material as you are reasonably able to assemble during the upcoming two
weeks with regard to these six issues. We wish to obtain a reasonably complete
response to these requests within one month. These six issues are identified in the text
by double asterisks (**).²
The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts involving first, the formal requests
for information and records, and second, the informal requests for information and
records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the following points
differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.
I. Formal Requests.
CIA-1 Organizational Material.
CIA has collected information responsive to this request for Review Board
action. The ARRB staff has identified records that it believes will enhance the
²As identified more fully below, the six issues are: CIA-7 (Histories); CIA-16
(Oswald Pre-assassination files); personnel assigned to a designated post;
QKENCHANT; the electronic take from the Mexico City Station; and files on George
Stanley Brown.
³This memorialization follows-up, in large part, on your conversations of March
19 and 20, 1997 with Michelle Combs and on the DO and DS&T briefings to the ARRB
staff on April 1, 1997.

historical understanding of the assassination by providing some background on
CIA records.
CIA should now review the DO and DS&T organizational material and
re-examine some of the proposed redactions. Several documents have been
cleared by the directorate IRO's for either release in full or release with minor
redactions. The ARRB staff will consult with CIA to determine whether these
records should be designated "assassination records" or whether they could be
made available publicly in a manner similar to the material from the 1996 Boston
trip. HRG would like to discuss this issue before the materials are formally put
before the Review Board.
CIA-2 through CIA-5.
These requests have been satisfied and no further action is needed by CIA.

CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches.
The Review Board first made this request on September 11, 1995. On September
11, 1995, CIA agreed to make these materials available by December, 1995. On
October 1, 1996, CIA agreed to make these materials available by November,
1996.
We are aware that many of the cables requested are already in the JFK files, but
not all are included. Those that we have not been able to locate in the collection
include: Mexico City Station to Headquarters (September 26-30, 1963);
Headquarters to Mexico City Station (September 26-30, 1963); JMWAVE to
Headquarters (September 26-November 21, 1963); Headquarters to JMWAVE
(September 26-November 21, 1963); and all traffic between the Mexico City
Station and JMWAVE for the periods September 26-October 20, 1963 and
November 22-December 30, 1963.
⁵CIA-7 Histories.
The Review Board first requested access to several internal CIA histories and to
indices of histories on November 8, 1995. On August 8, 1996, after reviewing a
list of histories that you provided, the ARRB staff designated approximately
sixty histories for which further review was sought. To date, the ARRB staff has
reviewed the seven histories that CIA has made available and has made
suggestions with respect to further processing of those seven histories. CIA
should make the remaining sixty-plus histories available.
CIA-8 Intelligence Community Staff records.
The Review Board first requested information on the Intelligence Community
Staff on March 1, 1996. On October 1, 1996, CIA agreed to report on the status of
this request within two weeks. The Review Board has not yet received any
substantive response to this request.
CIA-9 Intelligence Community publications on Cuba or USSR (November 20-30, 1963).
The LBJ Library has already identified several publications for mandatory

review. Michelle Combs reviewed the materials and identified some that should
probably become available to the public. The DI has been tasked to locate the
additional publications that have been requested.
CIA-10 Interagency Source Register.
CIA has provided a full description of the ISR, which should now be submitted
as a formal response to the Review Board's request. Once the formal statement is
provided, this request will be complete. (Under separate cover, the Review
Board is sending to you an additional request for information and records, CIA-
17, which provides a list of names that we request you check against the
Interagency Source Register.)
CIA-11 Sylvia Duran materials.
CIA reports that it has exhausted its reasonable leads for pursuing additional
information. CIA has agreed to provide a formal letter for the record detailing
what searches were done and confirming that the responsive document currently
in the JFK collection is a true copy of the original letter. Once this formal
statement is provided, this request will be complete.
CIA-12 JMWAVE and David Sanchez Morales.
On May 22, 1996, the Review Board requested access to "all 201 files, personnel
files, Office of Security files, P-files, or any other files" relating to five persons
allegedly connected to JMWAVE. It is our understanding that, in response to
this request, several months ago CIA located and made available for our review
many records responsive to this request. However, it is also our understanding
They include:
Intelligence Report (11/22/63; 11/23/63; 11/24/63; 11/26/63; 11/27/63;
12/11/63; 12/13/63; 12/18/63; and 12/20/63).
Intelligence Memorandum (11/23/63; 11/24/63; 11/25/63; 11/25/63;4/20/64;
and 10/16/64).
President's Intelligence Checklist (11/23/63; 11/24/63; 11/25/63;11/26/63;
11/27/63;11/28/63; and 11/30/63).

that all of the records provided were located in the Sequestered Collection.
As stated in the second paragraph at the beginning of this letter, we seek to
review the original files that we have requested. The DO provided no response
and no time frame for a response.
CIA-13 Mexico City Backchannel Communications.
This request, dated November 1, 1996, was raised at the DO follow-up briefing
on April 1, 1997. The DO provided no response and no time frame for a
response.
CIA-14 Mexico City Station Annual Reports.
This request, dated December 23, 1996, was raised at the DO follow-up briefing
on April 1, 1997. The DO provided no response and no time frame for a
response.
CIA-15 Win Scott files identified in Russ Holmes Files.
CIA has completed its response and no further action is needed.
⁶CIA-16 Oswald Pre-Assassination Files.
The HRG reportedly received a lengthy answer from the Office of Security on the
LHO files and a formal response to the Review Board's request is in process.
Oswald's Office of Security file has been located and will be delivered to HRG
for review in April. Access to other files will require a special request from HRG
to the Office of Security and should be requested by HRG for ARRB staff review.
II. Informal Requests.
All of the following informal requests have previously been made to CIA. For future
reference, they will be referred to by the "Informal Request" (IR) number provided
below.
Mr. J. Barry Harrelson
April 16, 1997
Page 7
⁷CIA-IR-01 Personnel assigned to post from 1959-64 (see RIF 104-10065-10199).
This request, originally made in November 1996, was raised at the DO follow-up
briefing on April 1, 1997. It is our understanding that the DO believes that it is
not able to answer this request. The ARRB staff does not find DO's response to
be credible. We believe that with all of the resources at the Agency's disposal --
including ready contact with individuals who should be able to answer this
question from memory - this question can be answered. The ARRB staff has
provided suggestions as to how this information could be obtained, including
suggesting the types of files and cables that could be searched.
CIA-IR-02 Location of cable identified in JFK 1993.07.20.10.18:29:650630.
The cable was delivered to the Review Board on March 20, 1997. No further
action by CIA is needed.
CIA-IR-03 Full computer search for list of documents in HTLINGUAL file.
CIA should undertake a computer run for all HTLINGUAL documents. All
computer searches for these documents should be documented in a formal letter
for the record.
CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton's files.
The Review Board seeks to ensure that it has taken all reasonable steps to
account for any files that James Jesus Angleton possessed or controlled that
related to the assassination and to Lee Harvey Oswald. Because of the perceived
controversy surrounding the disposition of Angleton's files, the Review Board
believes it prudent to obtain a clear understanding of the types of files that he
maintained and their ultimate disposition. (The Review Board does not seek to
explore any subjects in Angleton's files beyond those that may have pertained to
the assassination.) To date, CIA has made available certain documents provided by
the CIC and the case files for Mangold v. CIA. The Review Board requests any
additional information in the possession of CIA that would explain the
disposition of Angleton's files.
⁸The ARRB staff has spoken with a retired CIA official who claims to be able to
answer this question from memory, but who refused to do so.
Mr. J. Barry Harrelson

CIA-IR-05 Possible foreign source for records on Oswald.
CIA was informally requested, more than two years ago, to use its contacts to
pursue certain records related to Oswald that were orally described to CIA. The
Review Board believed that, for reasons of security classification of information,
