Dear Charles,
Thank you for your letter of 15 October
recommending against the declassification of
Warren Commission document CD-971. I might
montion that our inquiry to you in August (1968)
was in anticipation of further pressure for the
release of Warren Commission papers, a pressure
which has not materialized. Accordingly, there is
not, at the present tias, any intention to release
CD-971.
Should the question be raised at some futuro
time, the points made by you in your letter provide
every reason to keep the document out of the
public domain.
With kindest regards,
Document Number 1042-947C
for FOIA Review on SEP 1976
Sincerely,
/s/ Richard Helms
