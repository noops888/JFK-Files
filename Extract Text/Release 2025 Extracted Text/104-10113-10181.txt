Missing Subject Files
QUINE, Myrtle V.
GUSS, David R.
HESS, Rudolph J.
SILVER, Helena V.
BRANDMAY, Rach G.
A review of the subject files reflects that they do not meet with
the requirements set forth in recent instructions from the Assistant Director for
Special Operations.
I request that this office be furnished with two copies of personal
history statements of each of the subjects at the earliest date possible
in order that appropriate security checks may be initiated.
