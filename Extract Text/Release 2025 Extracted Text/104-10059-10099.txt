1. Reference is made to your request dated 4 January 1966
for a Covert Security Approval to permit Subject's use as a First
Officer in the Far East under Project HBILKA/JBGREED. Concurrent
with issuance of the approval, the following is offered for your
information.
2. Investigation has recently been completed with generally
favorable results. However, Subject's military file indicated that
he had been found unfit for duty due to excessive drinking, and
had been allowed to retire in the best interests of the Navy. His
Navy record stated that this drinking problem adversely affected
his judgement, reliability, and personal behavior. This weakness
had been discussed to no avail with Subject on several occasions.
It should be noted that domestic inquiries developed no indica-
tion of over-indulgence since his departure from the military on
October 1964.
3. Additionally, it was developed that Subject's brother
Bartholomew, aka: Bart PUGH, was the Subject of an FBI investi-
gation in 1941, which was conducted to resolve allegations regarding
the loyalty of Subject's brother. Subject's brother was determined
to have been associated with known Communists and was active in
Communist matters in the Los Angeles, California area during this
period of time. However, it was noted that these activities had
caused a break with this individual and his family, who were not
in sympathy with his viewpoints and activities. There was no
