Papich began with a brief summary of his experi-
ence in the FBI. During World War II and there-
after he ran certain operations in Latin America.
In 1945-47, he ran counterintelligence operations
in Brazil against the Communist Party of Brazil
and bloc intelligence agents. In 1952 he became
FBI liaison with CIA charged with coordinating
and planning, including the development of sources.
He also had special assignments overseas for Hoover.
Papich presented the following overview of the

is no estimate of how many Soviet illegals are in
the United States. The old view was that illegals
would aim at middle-class government and business
positions. It has been discovered that they take
jobs like dishwasher to develop an employment
background. There is no knowledge of Soviet
objectives. Illegals may do nothing for years so
they can be tapped for the future. There may be
100, 500, or 5,000 of them. Some were sent in as
early as the 20's and 30's. They are the Rudolph
Abel-type.
His network was never identified.
Therefore, Papich is clearly unhappy with U. S.
results in identifying Soviet operations in the
United States.
Papich stated that he played a controversial
"devil's advocate" role between the FBI and the
CIA. He did not confer with Attorney General
Mitchell after Helms called his name to Mitchell's
attention. Papich assumes Helms wanted Mitchell
to get a review of the history of FBI-CIA relations.
Papich would not have gone to Mitchell without
checking with other FBI officials.

To understand decisions in 1966 or 1970 it is
necessary to go back to World War II, according
to Papich. President Roosevelt got the FBI into
the foreign intelligence field in World War II.
Overnight the FBI had to generate the capability
to move into Latin America against the German
espionage operation which included business covers,
radio networks, and influence in Latin American
governments.
The FBI had no precedent or guidance.

couldn't do that with foreign police. A foreign
intelligence service cannot operate like a domestic
intelligence agency.
In 1952, when Papich became FBI-CIA liaison, rela-
tionships between the agencies were a mess. Beedle
Smith was CIA director. There were many flaps
between FBI and CIA over CIA political and psycho-
logical warfare, especially regarding the funding
of labor groups, student groups, and political
parties. At the time of the 19 1947 Act, these tech-
niques of "covert action" were the subject of
tremendously heated battles between CIA and State.
There were fewer flaps in the counterintelligence
field.
In the field of political and psychological warfare
operations, the CIA didn't want stereotyped people.
The CIA was not disciplined and ignored jurisdictional
agreements.
It would contact a U. S. newsman about a

possible assignment, the newsman would contact
the FBI to ask what was going on, this would go
to Hoover, who would raise hell with the CIA
director. But Beedle Smith was tough. Communi-
cation between the FBI and CIA was almost non-
existent by 1952.
Papich had no CIA counterpart since the CIA is
so compartmented. He had contacts at all levels,
exchanging ideas for operations. He would push
CIA ideas in the FBI. Flaps would come up. He
would stamp them out and say "get on with the job".

Tolson
Hoover never
expressed a desire to give up his intelligence
job. Nobody, including Tolson, knew Hoover's
reasons for doing what he did. He had his own
conversations and contacts in the White House,
Congress, and his personal sources. He knew what
he was doing and had "a nose and ear for the
political climate in Washington". This was true
for "risky" operations.
Papich believes it would be disastrous to give
both foreign and domestic intelligence duties to
a CIA. While there would be advantages in
coordinating fragmented sources, it is a risk to
liberty, like a national police.
Papich did not recall any significant plan to
improve coordination in 1958 when FBI joined USIB.
FBI was part of the USIB predecessor group.
The CIA would suggest joint field operations but
Hoover would rarely buy it. This was like his
reluctance to join any operation with any other
agencies. He thought the FBI should always have
control, a commanding role. For example, Allan
Dulles discussed the United Nations with Hoover.

Friction would develop in "the gray area" of posi-
tive intelligence. For example, a top foreign
official came to the United States for medical
treatment. The CIA knew he was coming to the U. S.
and wanted to know his relationship with Communists
and wanted intelligence on the instability in the
country. The CIA wants him surveilled to find out
his contacts, what he's saying, and a wiretap or

Regarding FBI service and support to other agencies,
Hoover was "goddamned careful". He was sensitive
to any "risks" and thus any request for FBI support
had to be established firmly. Hoover never
responded "let them do it" within the United
States. Hoover did not give other agencies any
blessing or approval for questionable domestic
activities such as the case of the Bolivian official
mentioned above.
In both the FBI and the CIA, Papich stimulated
interest in covering and recruiting people in
the United States, for example embassy officials.
The CIA wanted to use its sources to recruit
foreign officials in the United States before the
officials went home. These officials are not

There were flaps in the 1950's when the CIA
recruited without clearing with the FBI. The CIA
asked for FBI wiretapsino more than five or six
times. Papich was asked by FBI officials whether
the CIA ever went to the Attorney General directly
for wiretap authority. Papich says this may have
happened, but not to his knowledge. Few Attorneys

Regarding the CIA and domestic dissidents, in
the 50's the CIA's general attitude was not to
investigate or surveil Americans overseas. FBI-
CIA communications rarely involved U. S. citizen
targets unless they clearly involved a KGB agent.
In the 1960's, Papich recalls two early incidents
of FBI requests for CIA coverage overseas.
One
was the Republic of New Africa, a black group
with contacts with Communists and foreign radicals
(note by Elliff the individual was Robert
Williams?). The second was Stokely Carmichael, who
traveled around the world. The FBI asked the CIA
for coverage of Carmichael's contacts overseas
but there were no results since the CIA had no
capability. In retrospect, Papich thinks his
importance was exaggerated.

CIA regarding Dr. King. The FBI levied no requests

was not a CIA priority. CIA was satisfied with FBI
coverage of the Communist Party. If the KGB was

there was Soviet financial support into the 1960's.
The FBI attitude as early as the 50's was that the
CIA did not have the capability to discover CPUSA
links to the Soviet Union. There were no leads for
the CIA to explore in France, Czechoslovakia, etc.
If a Communist Party member went to Rome or London,
then FBI would ask CIA coverage, but the CIA gave
it low priority and produced little. This led to
FBI dissatisfaction with CIA, so FBI went through
its legal attaches, who would contact foreign
security services. Normally, the CIA was informed
but sometimes the CIA was not notified if the FBI
called it "an internal security" matter. Papich

life should be protected. Instead, the FBI informed
the CIA of the results upon the informant's return.
The FBI liaison section was made up of six or seven
agents. Papich and Bill Creager handled the CIA.
Creager dealt specifically with USIB, the Security
Committee, the Interagency Defector Committee, and
the Office of Security. Papich and Creager backed
each other up in their respective areas. There
were several liaison agents at the Pentagon. The
liaison at State was Oren Bartlett. The other
liaison agents were not so deeply involved in in-
telligence operations as was Papich. FBI liaison
at NSA was Bill McDonnell, although Papich was also

Regarding the CIA and Local police, the only thing
Papich recalls is discussion of the CIA's relation-
ship with New York City police. The purpose was
not operations, but protection of CIA New York
facilities. He was also aware of relationships
between Washington, D. C., and suburban police for
protection of CIA facilities and personnel. He
knew that some CIA employees joined questionable
groups and that the CIA was concerned about its
personnel associating with radicals and protesters.
The CIA Office of Security informed the FBI in
1967-1970 that it had developed from two to six
sources to assess involvement of CIA personnel in
protest groups. The information provided to the
FBI from these sources about such groups was "crap".
Papich was not involved in any meetings with CIA
sources. He is not aware of any CIA activity re-
garding Women's Strike for Peace, nor was he aware
of any CIA intelligence operations for the purpose
of protecting CIA from violent demonstrations.
CIA should have relied on FBI.
Bill Creager was succeeded as liaison with Office
of Security by Fred Cassidy. They provided memo-
randa to the FBI Intelligence Division on all trans-
actions with CIA. Creager kept Papich advised,
especially of the potential for flaps and for
successful operations. Papich believes Office of
Security was restricted both in number of personnel
and by CIA rules. It could claim a need to protect

Regarding the Dominican Republic in 1965, Papich
recalls the fear of another Cuba by the President
and the National Security Council. Johnson may
have asked the FBI for help. An FBI agent from
the office in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and possibly
from Mexico City, were sent to the Dominican
Republic. This was done with CIA approval and the
joint effort was successful. There were no flaps.
The FBI agent had sources all over Central America
going back to World War II. Other FBI activities
in the Caribbean grew out of the FBI's role in
Havana before Castro, Jamaica, Miami, and San Juan.
