MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Career Management Group
SUBJECT:
:
Promotion of Mr. Calvin W. Hicks
1. I would solicit Career Management Group and the Promotion Panel
to consider the overall career of Calvin W. Hicks when deciding on the cur-
rent cycle of promotions from GS-13 to GS-14.
2. After Mr. Hicks EOD in 1950, he advanced rapidly in three years
to GS-11. He was promoted to GS-12 in 1956, six years later to. GS-13 in
1962, and since then has been almost 12 years in grade. He has had over-
seas tours with FE and NË Divisions, has served as a training instructor, on
a PM task force, and with Miami Ops and area branches in WIH. In these
assignments he consistently received Strong ratings. Despite a largely para-
military background, in 1967 he adjusted to the intelligence production cycle
and developed the skills of an operations officer doing operations-oriented
reports work in the Intelligence Watch. As of this date he has the longest
continuity in' the Intelligence Watch and is rated as a mature and thoughtful
Individual who exercises excellent professional judgment. He was recom-
mended for promotion from GS-13 to GS-14 in April 1968 and in April 1969.
In 1970 he was recommended for a QSI by FI Chief, Peer deSilva. He was
again recommended for promotion in March 1971, in November 1972, and in
November 1973.
3. Admittedly, promotions are competitive and the rankings are rela-
tive and must be adjusted to the headroom available. The overall history of
his career would seem to argue the equity of granting the often recommended
promotion to Mr. Calvin Hicks as he nears the end of a career. Mr. Hicks is
49 years old and has a family of five children. He has a medical hold which
will not allow him to serve overseas at this time and he therefore, contem-
plates retirement at age 50 (in late 1974). He is and will be until then a
valuable member of the Intelligence Watch.
4. I recommend that the promotion which has escaped him in the last
decade be granted at the time of this year's promotion cycle.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Career Management Group
Mid-Career Officer Branch
SUBJECT : Recommendation for the Promotion of Calvin W. Hicks (056361)
to 6S-14
1. I would again like to recommend the promotion of subject officer from
GS-13 to GS-14. Mr. Hicks has been with the Intelligence Watch since June 1967
and his performance has been characterized consistently by exceptional proficiency.
He serves on a rotating schedule with seven other officers doing identical work,
some of whom are currently in GS-14.
2. A medical hold has precluded any further overseas assignments and for
this reason his stay in IW has been extended until November 1974, when he will
be 50-years-old at which time he plans to retire under the Agency retirement
system.
3. Mr. Hicks' resourcefulness and ability to apply the multitude of
reporting. instructions and techniques have been convincingly demonstrated in
crisis situations such as the recent Chilean coup and the Middle-Eastern crisis.
He has consistently displayed initiative and good judgment in meeting unforeseen
crisis with rapid and effective action and has clearly demonstrated his ability
to continuously adjust to rotating shifts and the irregular flow of traffic.
4. For his sustained high level of performance in 1972 Mr. Hicks received
a quality step increase in recognition and as proof of the high esteem in which
he is held by his superiors. He occupies a GS-14 slot. His promotion is again
recommended in recognition of his long years of Agency service.

Appreciation of IW Performance During
Chilean Upheaval
1. The officers of the Intelligence Watch (IW) perfornied
admirably in swiftly processing the heavy flow of intelligence
engendered by the recent political upheaval in Chile. In many
instances, reports were in the hands of customers in the intel-
ligence community within minutes of being filed in Santiago.
2. Please extend to the IW officers concerned the appre-
ciation of this Division for their fine performance. I suggest that
a copy of this memorandum be placed in the personnel folder of

SUBJECT
Intelligence Watch Assistance to
European Division
1. As I am preparing to leave the European Division,
a note of appréciation is in order for the services rendered
to us for the four years of my tenure here by the officers
of the Intelligence Watch.
2. At a time of increasingly complicated intelligence
collection and reporting problems, our Agency has come of
age. We have recognized that information often cannot be
allowed to wait for attention until sunrise, and that we
must be able to respond to national needs and world events
rround the clock. The Intelligence Watch, more than any
other single institution, has made it possible for us to
đó this. We have benefited from its cooperation particularly
under strained reporting conditions -- during Presidential.
trips abroad, for instance -- but have also found IW's
presence and judgment helpful at other times. I know that
my staff relied on IW extensively.
3. I am making a point of recognizing this because
the Intelligence Watch -- a bit like our Agency as a whole --
is apt to get more attention with an occasional slip than
with a record of continuing accomplishment and success in
coping with problems. From what I have been able to observe,
the job has been well done.
4. I hope you will bring this memorandum to the
attention of those concerned.

SUBJECT
Awards Panel
Request for Quality Step Increase
Mr. Calvin W. HICKS, GS-13 (056361)
1. I recommend that a Quality Step Increase be
awarded to Mr. Calvin W. Hicks.
2. Mr. Hicks is one of three officers in the Intel-
ligence Watch, FI Staff, on whom identical recommendations
are being submitted. These officers, all in grade GS-13,.
have for several years done responsible and demanding work,
identical to that done in the same office by five other of-
ficers, GS-14 and 15, and all three have been rated "Strong."
3. The Intelligence Watch is the primary intelligence
dissemination office of the Clandestine Service. Its out-
put of over 2,000 reports a month is the chief end-product
of CS collection operations. Watch Officers serve on a
rotating schedule. When an officer draws the night shift
he serves alone. He must make quick, independent dissemina-
tion decisions. Mr. Hicks has done well at this work. He
is alert and conscientious and has a sharp operational sensė
which is extremely useful in the handling of CS intelligence
information. He has been recommended several times for pro-
motion to GS-14.
i
4. The high quality of Mr. Hicks's performance has
continued for more than two years. There is no reason to
expect any decline in it. His enthusiasm continues, and
his tour has recently been extended for another two years.
5. Consideration has been given to recommending him
for an Honor and Merit Award, but on balance I believe that
a Quality Step Increase would be more appropriate.

MEMORANDUM FOR: SECRETARY, CSPS/SECTION A
SUBJECT:
RECOMMENDATION FOR THE PROMOTION OF
CALVIN W. HICKS (056361) TO GS-14
1. I RECOMMEND THE PROMOTION OF SUBJECT OFFICER FROM GS-13 TO GS-14.
MR. HICKS HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO THE INTELLIGENCE WATCH/FI STAFF SINCE JUNE
1967 AND SERVES ON A ROTATING SCHEDULE WITH SEVEN OTHER OFFICERS DOING
IDENTICAL WORK, FIVE OF WHOM ARE CURRENTLY IN GRADE GS-14.
2. MR. HICKS HAS BEEN IN THE INTELLIGENCE WATCH (IW) FOR ALMOST
FOUR YEARS AND HIS WORK, BOTH QUANTITATIVELY AND QUALITATIVELY, HAS BEEN
CONSISTENTLY OF A VERY HIGH CALIBER..
3. HIS KEENLY DEVELOPED SENSE OF OPERATIONAL SECURITY RESULTING FROM
HIS EXTENSIVE PARAMILITARY EXPERIENCE, COUPLED WITH. HIS CLEAR UNDERSTAND-
ING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OPERATIONS AND INTELLIGENCE, HAS MADE HIM
A VERY FINCE OFFICER AND A VALUABLE ASSET TO IW. HE HAS BEEN UNDER MY SU-
PLRVISION FOR 18 MONTHS AND I HAVE HAD AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO OBSERVE HIS
PERFORMANCE UNDER CONDITIONS OF STRESS. HE VERY ABLY APPLIES A MULTITUDE
OF DETAIL AND GENERAL REPORTING INSTRUCTIONS TO THE DIFFERENT SITUATIONS
MANIFEST IN EACH INCOMING REPORT AND DISPLAYS INITIATIVE IN MEETING UN-
FORESEEN CRISES WITH RAPID AND EFFECTIVE ACTION. SINCE THE INTELLIGENCE
.NFORMATION IS THE FACE THAT THE CLANDESTINE SERVICE PUTS OUT TO THE IN-
TELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, THE PERFORMANCE OF WATCH OFFICERS IS OF GREAT
¡MPORTANCE. THIS FACTOR BECOMES APPARENT WHEN IT IS NOTED THAT OVER
75 PERCENT OF ALL CABLED INTELLIGENCE REPORTS ARE DISSEMINATED BY IW.
4. MR. HICKS HAS AN EXTENSIVE BACKGROUND IN PARAMILITARY OPERATIONS
BOTH IN THE FIELD AND AT HEADQUARTERS. ALL OF HIS FITNESS REPORTS FOR THE
SIX YEARS PRECEDING HIS ASSIGNMENT TO IW HAVE BORNE THE OVERALL RATING
OF "STRONG." HE HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS "HIGHLY MOTIVATED, SINCERE, AND,
CAPABLE. ALSO, "HE WORKS WELL WITH OTHERS AND HIS KNOWLEDGE AND ABILITY
ARE RESPECTED." OTHER SUPERVISORS DURING THE YEARS PRIOR TO THIS ASSIGN-
FMENT HAVE DESCRIBED HIM AS "SERIOUS, HARD-WORKING AND DEPENDABLE." HIS
PERFORMANCE IN HIS PRESENT ASSIGNMENT HAS DEMONSTRATED THESE SAME QUALI-
TIES.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, DDP QSI and Honor and Merit
SUBJECT
Awards Panel
Request for Quality Step Increase
Mr. Calvin W. HICKS, GS-13 (056361)
1. I recommend that a Quality Step Increase be
awarded to Mr. Calvin W. Hicks.
2. Mr. Hicks is one of three officers in the Intel-
ligence Watch, FI Staff, on whom identical recommendations
are being submitted. These officers, all in grade GS-13,.
have for several years done responsible and demanding work,
identical to that done in the same office by five other of-
ficers, GS-14 and 15, and all three have been rated "Strong."
3. The Intelligence Watch is the primary intelligence
dissemination office of the Clandestine Service. Its out-
put of over 2,000 reports a month is the chief end-product
of CS collection operations. Watch Officers serve on a
rotating schedule. When an officer draws the night shift
he serves alone. He must make quick, independent dissemina-
tion decisions. Mr. Hicks has done well at this work. He
is alert and conscientious and has a sharp operational sensė
which is extremely useful in the handling of CS intelligence
information. He has been recommended several times for pro-
motion to GS-14.
i
4. The high quality of Mr. Hicks's performance has
continued for more than two years. There is no reason to
expect any decline in it. His enthusiasm continues, and
his tour has recently been extended for another two years.
5. Consideration has been given to recommending him
for an Honor and Merit Award, but on balance I believe that
a Quality Step Increase would be more appropriate.
