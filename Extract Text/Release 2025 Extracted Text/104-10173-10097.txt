SUMMARY
SUSCEPTIBILITY: Nothing in the conventional sense. If he is trying to
tell us anything he is obviously trying to get our attention via a CI
ploy with the intention of bringing us to him. He moves with confidence
and near-impunity- certainly not like one who might be in trouble.
PROFESSICANLISM: Not smooth and subtle nor particularly secure. But
crafty, fast on his feet, makes fast decisions and then acts on them.
Aggressive and ubiquitous. Socially active. Woman-chaser.
PERSONALITY: See above.
Should be leaving before another year and one-half. Has been there for
: three and one-half years.
