1. We came in contact with a new source who will be a continuing one,
known as Robert A. Pratchett, a US citizen with 27 years experience in
Cuba who is currently in direct contact with a Cuban counterrevolutionary
group in the US known as Alpha-66, and who is also in contact with anti-
Castro Cubans working in Havana. He will give us more detailed information
during the coming weeks, and represent to us the ambitions, operations
and proposed sabotage activities of Alpha-66 so that they can either be
controlled, encouraged or discouraged, as the case may be from the
viewpoint of those interested in Cuban action groups.
2. Bio data on Pratchett, for any prior clearance or interest in
him, based on what he may present to us for consideration, is as follows:
Date & Place of Birth - 31 Oct 1918, Havana, Cuba (US citizen
by birth)
Education - University of Pennsylvania, 1940
Employment - 1961 - Present H. H. Pike Co., New York and Havana
1958-1960 Brando and Co., Havana
1946-1958 Paramount Pictures International, Havana
1941-1945 US Army (Rank of Major)
Present Address 35 Walton Ave., New Providence, New Jersey
3. Prachett, who appears to be a mature and loyal US citizen, is
interested in being of the best possible service to the US Government in
a non-pay status, in assisting where he can in terms of his detailed
knowledge of Cubans, Cuba, and the Spanish language, which he speaks
perfectly. Other than observing the plans of the Alpha-66 group as a
potentially successful sabotage group, he is not affiliated with any
counterrevolutionary group, but is now in business for himself as a
private investor in a firm he owns and operates, called/PREFIXT Business
Forms Inc., 60 East 42nd St., New York. He indicated that Alpha-66 plans
were to blow all the power plants in Cuba.
