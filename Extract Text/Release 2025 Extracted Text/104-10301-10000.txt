CHAPTER IV
In the meanwhile, Cuba remained a sore point for both the CIA and
the Kennedys.
Shortly after the Bay of Pigs, President Kennedy asked General
Maxwell Taylor to chair a small commission, consisting of Robert
Kennedy, Allen Dulles and Admiral Arleigh Burke, to investigate.
Highly critical of the piecemeal and acquiescent administrative
decisions which had accompaned the operation's progress, the Taylor
report was mild in comparison with the severely critical internal
report prepared by CIA Inspector General Lyman Kirkpatrick.
Robert Kennedy also produced a personal Bay of Pigs report to the
President, which he discussed with McCone in late November 1961. The
Attorney General was especially critical of Richard Bissell, Deputy
Director for Plans, because Bissell had told the President the
operation was likely to succeed. Robert Kennedy was also highly
critical of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for spending only twenty
minutes studying the planned operation before making its first report
to the President endorsing the operation.
It is worth noting that McCone was the only official in the

government privy to all the studies of the Bay of Pigs operation,
including the Taylor report, Robert Kennedy's personal report, the
Kirkpatrick report, and the views of the President's Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board.
McCone did not dwell on the Bay of Pigs after he took office, but
he did draw several conclusions. Firmly believing the decision to go
ahead was a mistake, he nevertheless thought it an even worse mistake
to dismember the operation once underway, contending that the CIA
should have appealed directly to the President to reverse the
decision to stand down the air strikes. Concluding as well that the
members of the Taylor commission had been too closely involved with
the events to have sufficient perspective, he believed the CIA and
JCS had to bear special responsibility for advising the new President
to go ahead, since at that time these were the only two Washington
organizations dealing with international affairs which possessed
complete continuity.
Taking a detached view of the operation, McCone was able to
concentrate on what the Agency could do to avoid similar mistakes in
the future. Leery of large-scale operations involving the Agency's
paramilitary capability, McCone strove, with mixed results, to remove
the CIA from such enterprises. He also stressed the importance of
planning an operation from beginning to end (an attitude which
dominated his approach during the Cuban missile crisis). Finally, he
insisted that the Agency's estimative function be privy to planned
operations, providing early and frequent judgments.

Cuba, however, remained a subject of considerable concern. In
April 1961, shortly after President Kennedy established the Taylor
Commission, Presidential adviser Walt Rostow speculated that Cuba
might join with the Soviet Union in setting up an offensive air or
missile base. He additionally posed that Cuba might build its
conventional military strength and develop its subversive network to
threaten other Latin American nations from without and within. "Its
ideological contours are a moral and political offense to us," he
concluded, "and we are committed, by one means or another, to remove
that offense...."
The Kennedy administration proceeded to address the situation
directly. At a White House meeting which McCone attended in late
November 1961, the President announced that General Edward Lansdale,
acting under the direction of the Attorney General, had already begun
to study possible actions to overthrow the Castro regime. These
covert activities, explained Robert Kennedy, included anything
possible to create internal dissension and discredit Castro. He then
proposed that, to accomplish this goal, Lansdale head up a committee
made up of representatives of Defense, State, USIA, and CIA, which
would cut across organizational lines.
McCone decided that the administration and the Agency both seemed
in a state of shock so far as Cuba was concerned. Although skeptical
from the beginning about the Lansdale program's prospects for
success, he nevertheless recognized that the CIA had a special role
and responsibility so far as Cuba was concerned. He himself

supported the notion of dynamic action, but urged that such action
not be reckless. Consequently, he recommended that the Lansdale
group report to the 5412 oversight committee, which was properly
qualified to give political guidance and evaluate proposals for
action. In addition, although McCone agreed the facilities of all
agencies should be made available for such high-priority operations,
he emphasized that these should remain in place and not be removed to
form a new unit under Lansdale.
In this way, MONGOOSE, as it came to be known, was launched.
With the White House's decision to go ahead (keeping the 5412
Committee fully informed), McCone proceeded to discuss the Lansdale
operation with top Agency officials. Acknowledging that the project
had to be closely held--Lansdale had asked that the CIA's
representative, Richard Helms, report only to the DCI--McCone
nevertheless stated he intended to skip no appropriate echelon of the
Agency, as such a course would deprive him of the advice of other
senior officers. Action would be at the Helms level, and the Agency
would offer Lansdale all necessary support and assistance, but
without excluding the participation of other Agency members within
the strict security guidelines laid down by the President. Further,
McCone directed the Board of National Estimates and the DD/I to
undertake a continuing evaluation of MONGOOSE, viewing such
precautions as a major step toward overcoming the compartmentation
which had excluded the DD/I from any advance knowledge of the Bay of
Pigs landing.

Significantly, McCone insisted on bringing analytical and
estimative functions to bear on Cuban operations from the beginning.
Most
Further, he insisted that truly clandestine actions be small.
importantly, he required that careful records be kept of actions and
conversations, himself setting an example by keeping meticulous
memoranda for the record.
MONGOOSE represented McCone's first working encounter with Robert
Kennedy. The Attorney General, McCone immediately realized, was a
dynamic force with a keen interest in the intelligence community, as
well as a strong influence on the President. McCone became quite
close to him. MONGOOSE also reinforced McCone's awareness of the
extent of the administration's obsession with Cuba. He consequently
accepted as a personal charge the administration's desire to
overthrow Castro. He was not, however, about to allow Lansdale or
anyone else dictate the use of CIA sources. Had he detached Agency
resources for Lansdale's use, McCone would have lost control. He
further insisted on the checks and balances of 5412 committee
overview.
:
:
The Special Group (5412 Committee), made up of the Special
Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Deputy
Secretary of Defense, the Under Secretary of State for Political
Affairs, the Director of Central Intelligence, and other appropriate
representatives, had been established in 1955 by National Security
Council Directive 5412/2 to provide interdepartmental coordination of
covert actions. In general, the Group's cognizance extended to any

covert activity which, because of its impact, could, if exposed,
reflect on the official position of the United States. Thus, a
sizeable activity aimed solely at intelligence collection through
clandestine methods could come under the Group's scrutiny.
Conversely, small political actions, with little flap potential,
could be undertaken without referring the activity to the Group.
The Kennedys, however, were sufficiently alarmed over the threat
of Communist subversion and covert aggression that, in January 1962,
another special committee, Special Group (Counterinsurgency),
appeared. Largely the brainchild of General Maxwell Taylor, Special
Group (CI) aimed at identifying those areas where an insurgent threat
existed or threatened to emerge, directing the use of appropriate
resources to counter that threat.
In practice, the CIA had always been reluctant to expose its
activities to an interdepartmental body. The Defense Department had
been similarly reluctant to submit its extensive program of
peripheral reconnaissance flights to Special Group review, although,
beginning in June 1961, the group began to consider these flights.
The Special Group's influence depended, in the final analysis, on the
attitude of the President and the Special Group chairman, as well as
on the temper of the DCI. Allen Dulles served as an advocate for the
CIA's proposed activities. John McCone took the position that, as
DCI, he was a personal adviser to the President and thus free to
approve or disapprove the CIA's proposals as he saw fit.
The entire Cuban situation was difficult from the outset, and

McCone was careful to warn the President and Attorney General that he
anticipated no quick or easy road to success. With the approval of
Ambassador Alphand, a close personal friend of McCone, the French
embassy in Havana had agreed to serve as the Agency's Cuban eyes and
ears, with Philippe de Vosjoli, SDECE's Washington representative,
reporting directly to McCone. De Vosjoli reported that at least
ninety percent of all Cubans supported Castro, while McCone added
that of twenty-seven or twenty-eight CIA agents in Cuba, only twelve
presently were in communication. Contact even with these was
infrequent, and an additional team of seven, infiltrated in December,
had been captured (with two featured on a television "confession"
show).
Nevertheless, at a Special Group meeting in April 1962, McCone
urged a review of our national policy toward Cuba and asked that we
consider more aggressive action, including direct military
intervention. Noting that various intelligence reports suggested
that Castro was in deep trouble, he questioned whether the military
strength of the Castro government was as large and as effective as
had been understood. In response to objections that such a course
might lose us friends in Latin America, McCone countered that a show
of strength was more likely to win than lose us friends.
Shortly thereafter, McCone learned from the Attorney General that
there was some movement afoot to exchange our prisoners from the Bay
of Pigs for food. (Castro had offered to release the prisoners in
exchange for a large quantity of drugs and medicines). Later, in

early June, McCone suggested forming a committee to negotiate such a
release. Robert Kennedy was generally sympathetic, but did not at
that time request covert support for the project. The subject was
left for further discussion, with an agreement that it would not be
discussed with anyone in CIA, Defense, or State who was active in
Cuba operations.
In mid-July, McCone and Robert Kennedy reviewed the Cuban
situation in considerable detail. Kennedy thought that, although
considerable intelligence had been acquired, the program's action
phases had been disappointing. Shortly after, McCone had the
opportunity to review MONGOOSE with the President. Since the
beginning of February, McCone reported, nine intelligence collection
teams (about half the originally-planned number) had been infiltrated
into Cuba and maintained in place, thousands of Cuban refugees had
been systematically interrogated in Florida, and a number of
third-country agents recruited inside Cuba. U-2 overflights were
being conducted on a regular two-a-month schedule. The operation was
costing the CIA about $1 million per month in direct costs and even
more in indirect support costs.
Although McCone was skeptical about the aims and operations of
MONGOOSE, he believed the CIA bore a special responsibility to
collect intelligence on Cuba. He therefore told the President that
this collection effort had produced a substantial amount of hard
intelligence on conditions inside Cuba, and a continuation would
provide additional intelligence, possibly revealing opportunities for

political, guerrilla or insurgent activities designed to overthrow
Castro. McCone added, however, that many individuals felt that more
dynamic actions were called for, including mass landings and military
activity. McCone did not agree. Our intelligence, he said, did not
support this point of view, and any such attempts would face disaster
unless the United States was prepared to commit large military forces
to support them.
In the meantime, Castro had officially cast his lot with the
Soviet Union, and indications were increasing that the USSR was
willing to invest substantial amounts of money, not only to keep the
Cuban leader afloat, but to enhance his capability to create mischief
for the United States. After 1 February 1962, our U-2 flights over
Cuba increased from one to two per month, and intelligence reports
revealed steady Soviet shipments of military as well as economic aid.
On August 4, McCone learned that eleven Soviet ships believed to
be carrying arms were bound for Cuba. McCone asked for further
details. On August 5, he received a breakdown on the ships, and he
directed immediate U-2 coverage (which began the following day).
According to reports, up to 5,000 Soviet technicians had arrived, in
addition to military communications equipment. The preliminary U-2
readout, however, was not very helpful, and another flight was
planned for August 11.
On August 10, McCone met with Secretary of State Dean Rusk,
presidential military adviser General Maxwell Taylor, McGeorge Bundy,
Deputy Secrety of Defense Roswell Gilpatric and the Attorney

General. It was during this meeting, which approved intensifying
MONGOOSE operations, that McCone first shared outside the CIA his
fear that the Soviets might introduce offensive missiles into Cuba.
His statement had little immediate impact. The experts unanimously
and adamantly agreed that this was beyond the realm of possibility.
McCone's conclusion that the USSR might put offensive missiles
into Cuba was set in motion by the continuing influx of Soviet
military equipment. It was intensified by the arrival of Soviet
personnel, then brought to a head by reports which suggested that the
Soviet Union was preparing to install surface-to-air missiles (SAMS)
there.
Why, asked McCone, would the Soviet Union place SAMs in Cuba? If
the United States were to launch a military attack, the SAMs could be
easily and quickly destroyed. The SAMS were not being put there to
protect Cuban canecutters; therefore, McCone argued, their real
purpose was to blind the United States by deterring further U-2
overflights. This action would then permit the Soviet Union to take
further steps which they could reveal at a time of their own choosing.
McCone then asked himself what he would do if he were in
Khrushchev's shoes. The United States and Soviet Union were balanced
in nuclear weapons and missile delivery systems, but the USSR had a
decided edge in intermediate and medium-range missiles. These
missiles could not, however, reach the United States from Soviet
launch pads. The USSR had not deployed these missiles outside its
borders, presumably because they could be redirected against the

Soviet Union if they fell into the wrong hands. However, Cuba was
one place where the Soviets could safely put their missiles. As
McCone put it, "If I were Khrushchev, I'd put offensive missiles in
Cuba. Then I'd bang my shoe on the desk and say to the United
States, 'How do you like looking down the end of a gun barrel for a
change? Now, let's talk about Berlin and any other subject that I
choose, including all your overseas bases.'"
McCone had confidence in the logic of his conviction and was
prepared to alert the top policy levels. He recognized that he
lacked hard evidence, but was convinced that the implications of
putting Soviet offensive missiles in Cuba would be so serious for
American national security interests that the contingency should be
considered as soon as possible.
He stood absolutely alone.
At noon on August 21, he met with Dean Rusk, Secretary of Defense
Robert McNamara, Deputy Under Secretary of State Alexis Johnson, the
Attorney General, Maxwell Taylor, General Lyman Lemnitzer (Chairman,
Joint Chiefs of Staff), and McGeorge Bundy to review the Cuban
situation. He noted that since their last meeting on Cuba, the CIA
had received intelligence indicating an enormous increase in Soviet
military support to Cuba. Further, there now were indications of
construction work by Soviet personnel, as well as technicians to
handle the newly-delivered Soviet equipment. While the nature of the
construction remained unknown, McCone warned that it could be missile
sites. For, he emphasized, we had to consider the possibility that

the Soviets would install offensive weapons in Cuba.
The group proceeded to consider various courses of action open to
the United States should the Soviets place MRBMs in Cuba. McCone had
a three-part proposal already in hand, calling for 1) an immediate
aggressive political action program to awaken Latin America and the
Free World; 2) a provocative action against Guantanamo or some other
vital American interest, leading to instant United States
retaliation; and, 3) immediate commitment of sufficient U.S.
military forces to occupy Cuba, destroy the regime, free the people,
and establish Cuba as a member of the community of American States.
McCone noted that the group was reluctant to consider committing U.S.
military forces, however, both because of the magnitude of the task
and because of concern about Soviet retaliatory actions elsewhere in
the world.
Reaching no conclusions on any course of action, the group at
length asked McCone to brief the President on the situation. The
following day, McCone reported in detail to the President, adding the
personal report of De Vosjoli, who had recently visited Cuba. The
President, who appeared quite familiar with the situation, expressed
concern, but agreed with General Taylor and McCone that policy
decisions should wait until the next day, when he would meet with his
principal advisers.
On August 23, therefore, President Kennedy met with Rusk,
McNamara, Gilpatric, Taylor, Bundy and McCone to discuss Cuba. The
President requested an analysis of the threat which offensive

missiles located in Cuba posed to the United States and Latin
America. He requested as well a continuing analysis of the numbers
and types of Soviet and Oriental(as reported by De Vosjoli)
personnel being introduced, the quantities and types of equipment,
their probable uses, and all construction activity in Cuba. In
response to the President's question about our ability to
discriminate between SAM and surface-to-surface missile sites, McCone
said we probably could not differentiate between SAM sites and
350-mile surface-to-surface missiles, but that MRBMs and IRBMs could
be distinguished. McNamara noted that portable missiles could not be
located under any circumstances.
The President wondered whether we should make a statement of our
position in advance, outlining the courses of action open to us in
the event that the Soviets should install missiles in Cuba. He also
asked what we could do against such missile sites. Could we take
them out by air action, or would ground action be required? Could
they be destroyed by a substantial guerrilla action? He also asked
what we should do in Cuba if the Soviets decided to precipitate a
crisis in Berlin.
Secretary Rusk received approval for his proposal that the United
States inform its NATO allies, particularly Canada, of the growing
seriousness of the situation. The Joint Chiefs of Staff, however,
strongly opposed his recommendation to remove restrictions on
MONGOOSE operations operating out of Guantanamo. McCone again
proposed his three-part program to combat the current Cuban

situation. After consideration, the President directed the Defense
Department to prepare contingency plans for possible military action
against Cuba. He and his advisors agreed, however, that no steps
should be taken until full agreement was reached on a policy aimed at
completely solving the Cuban problem.
Cuba was our most serious problem, McCone shortly afterward told
Robert Kennedy, adding that, in comparison, he would readily give up
our missile bases in Italy and Turkey. Cuba, he told the Attorney
General, was more important than Berlin. It was the key to Latin
America; and if Castro succeeded, then most of Latin America would
fall to Soviet influence and domination.

forty-eight hours should the President's terms not be met.
Sunday morning, October 28, with U-2 overflights continuing and
no evidence of slow-down on the Cuban missile sites, Moscow
broadcast yet another Khrushchev communique--this one announcing
that, in the interest of world peace, the Soviet Union had agreed to
dismantle and return the Cuban missiles under United Nations
verification. Not waiting for the official text, the President
drafted a quick acceptance. The immediate crisis was over.
***
Serious problems, however, remained. It had become clear to
McCone that removing Castro no longer was an objective of American
policy, and he was concerned that, as a result of Soviet military
and economic aid, Castro would be left in a position to create much
mischief. Since no agreement had been reached for on-site
inspection, and the SAM system remained in place to limit aerial
inspection, the DCI and intelligence community would not be able to
verify the removal or check on possible future reintroduction of
Cuban missiles. Further, the MONGOOSE operation, tasked with
toppling Castro, was in disarray. Lansdale complained he was not
being kept informed of JCS planning and that the CIA's Cuban Task
Force was acting outside MONGOOSE channels. At the height of the
missile crisis (on October 26), a high-level meeting on MONGOOSE
agreed to recall intelligence collection teams and discontinue

TOP SECRET
sabotage operations while relations between the United States and
the Soviet Union were so delicate.
On November 3, McCone informed the Executive Committee that,
despite indications that the missiles were being dismantled, there
also were signs that the Soviets were taking steps which might
represent a continuing threat to the United States. More IL-28s had
been uncrated; some fourteen Soviet ships were en route to Cuba,
and there were indications that the Soviets were proceeding with
plans to develop a submarine support base at Banes. Stressing the
unprecedented nature of the SAM system deployment and the fact that
the system remained in place to provide a shield from aerial
inspection, McCone emphasized that we did not and could not know the
exact number of offensive missiles originally placed in Cuba or
whether all in fact had been removed. Indeed, McCone pointed out,
there remained a distinct possibility that missile complexes could
be hidden from view in Cuba's caves.
The President listened to McCone's warning but appeared more
concerned about the question of past intelligence failures. For by
this time postmortems had begun to surface alleging either a near
intelligence failure or the withholding of vital intelligence
information on the Cuban missile build-up. Deeply concerned, McCone
had already ordered an intensive internal investigation. Now the
President himself requested a review of the entire intelligence
community, seeking a judgment as to whether better intelligence and
intelligence evaluation could have forecast Cuban developments more

however, that the United States continue its surveillance and be
prepared to act if a plane were shot down.
98
With the release of the Bay of Pigs prisoners and the completion
of Donovan's mission, McCone again pressed for low-level flights
over Cuba--a recommendation supported by the USIB but opposed by
both McNamara and Rusk because of its possible political
consequences. Noting that the administration could not very well
ignore the views of the DCI and USIB, President Kennedy proposed
three sorties on a trial basis. But, after considering the pros and
cons, the President on May 21 decided to postpone a subsequent
low-level mission on the grounds of insufficient urgency.
Following the missile crisis, Cuban exile groups escalated their
activities, but the Executive Committee was unable to come to a firm
agreement on how to respond. Similarly, the Special Group to
consider Cuban sabotage operations met with disagreement and
indecision. It was clear McCone stood virtually alone in his view
that the United States should sustain an aggressive approach towards
Cuba, with the dual aim of getting rid of both the Soviet presence
and Castro. No senior officials went so far as to propose that the
covert action program be stopped; but the original impetus which
had given birth to the program had all but disappeared.
American policy towards Cuba, and especially the Agency's role
in supporting this policy, remained ambigious for the rest of
McCone's tenure. Officially, the United States held the Soviet

military presence in and Castro's control over Cuba to be
unacceptable. Practically, however, the disposition to take strong
actions had weakened. Instead, the administration was willing to
accept the removal of the missiles as an adequate foreign policy
achievement.
McCone never accepted this judgment; he never was comfortable
with the policy restrictions placed on Cuban operations, and he
never wavered in his conviction that in order to carry out the tasks
levied on him as DCI, he needed the freedom to carry out intensive
reconnaissance and covert operations.
Under President Johnson, there were flurries of concern about
Cuba; but, after the missile crisis, the momentum had largely
disappeared. The United States government turned its attention to
other issues, and McCone found himself once again fully engaged.

CHAPTER XVIII
Shortly before the coup began, on 1 November 1963, Diem suddenly
became cooperative.
Lodge and Admiral Harry Felt (CINCPAC) had been at the
Presidential palace until almost noon. Rather than see Felt off at
the airport, Diem asked if Lodge would remain. Lodge stayed, and
Diem proceded to tell him that he could understand President
Kennedy's concerns about South Vietnam. Lodge should assure the
President that he, Diem, was prepared to take almost any steps the
United States considered appropriate to correct existing problems
and improve relations.
Diem's concessions--if that was what they were--came too late.
At about the same time, General Don's aide-de-camp directed Lou
Conein to go at once to the Joint General Staff headquarters.
Assigned a private telephone, Conein proceeded to provide a
comprehensive, current and coherent account of the coup to the CIA
station in Saigon. The station, in turn, informed Washington.
The first reports reached Washington shortly after midnight. By
mid-morning it was clear the coup was likely to succeed. By this
time, however, both Diem and Nhu were dead, and the President was

concerned about the circumstances. When the facts became known, he
said, he hoped the new government would be able to state that the
Ngo brothers had either committed suicide or violated their
surrender agreement, rather than been murdered in cold blood.
The President was also concerned that the new government might
be tempted to offer anmesty to the Viet Cong. He consequently was
emphatic that we watch with care the type of political leadership
the military group might install. Warning against the installation
of ultra-liberals or quasi-Communists with a free hand in political
affairs, he remarked that he was more interested in an effective
than a "pretty" government.
As a result, President Kennedy sent William Colby, in the
capacity of Presidential representative, to Saigon--an assignment
which McCone noted with pleasure as a mark of great confidence in
both Colby and the CIA.
On November 18, McCone, Rusk, McNamara and Bundy flew to
Honolulu to confer with Lodge and Harkins. McCone later reported
that the formal briefing sessions had gone fairly predictably until
an economist named Silver from AID had discussed the South
Vietnamese economy, with its huge deficits and unfavorable balance
of trade. This briefing triggered a lively discussion and the
general conclusion that the Vietnamese economic situation was bleak,
with no apparent solution in sight.
There was other bad news as well. In some areas, the Viet Cong
reportedly had a better strategic hamlet and school system than the

government. And it was clear to everyone present that the military
situation was far from rosy, although Harkins tried to put it in a
good light. The meeting decided that a major effort should be made
to construct strategic hamlets and to wage anti-guerrilla warfare in
the delta region, but McCone returned more discouraged than ever
about Vietnam and believed McNamara and Bundy shared this
impression. Lodge, McCone remarked, would emerge from Vietnam
either as a fourteen-foot-tall political giant or as a thoroughly
washed-up government official.
***
The end of the Diem era marked one kind of transition in
Vietnam; President Kennedy's assassination, on November 22, marked
another.
The day after the assassination, as official Washington and the
world were trying to come to grips with the shocking news, McCone
told his morning meeting that he knew very little about the new
President's personal relationships around Washington or his position
on current issues. In late August, Lyndon Johnson as Vice President
had been opposed to ousting the Diem regime, but McCone had not even
spoken with him since the time of the Cuban prisoner exchange.
McCone then reviewed the CIA memorandum on world reactions to
the President's assassination and ordered that it be disseminated.
He also reviewed the President's Intelligence Checklist and directed

that it be delivered to the White House as usual. Johnson was
unaware of the checklist, having previously received the Current
Intelligence Bulletin. McCone reported that Johnson had told
McGeorge Bundy to carry on as before, and that the Agency should
therefore continue to move its publications through the usual
channels until directed otherwise.
In other ways, McCone attempted to carry on as before. Before
the morning meeting, he had instructed Walt Elder to telephone
Johnson's secretary to tell her that he would be at the White House
at 9:00 a.m. as usual, to give the President his regular morning
intelligence briefing. This message was relayed as a statement of
fact. The only question was whether Johnson would be going to his
old office in the Executive Office Building or to the Oval Office.
The word came back that Johnson was on his way to the White House.
McCone accordingly was at the White House by 9:00 a.m. At 9:15,
President Johnson arrived.
Johnson opened the conversation by recalling a long background
of association and friendship with McCone. On a number of issues
which had arisen since McCone had become DCI, Johnson said he and
McCone had seen eye to eye. Expressing great respect for the CIA
and complete confidence in McCone as DCI, Johnson said he wanted
McCone to continue in the future doing exactly as he had done in the
past.
After McCone in turn expressed his confidence in the President
and stated his desire to support him in every way, he reviewed some

of the items from the President's checklist, explaining the nature
of the publication. Johnson asked that, for the next few days,
McCone continue to brief him personally every morning and that
senior CIA officials brief the President's staff. Johnson also
directed that any urgent matter of importance be brought to his
personal attention at any hour of the day or night. In this, he
designated no intermediary.
That noon, McCone met with both Johnson and Bundy to relay the
information that Lee Harvey Oswald had been in touch with the Soviet
and Cuban embassies in Mexico City. That evening, McCone reviewed
this information with Secretary Rusk, in addition volunteering the
Agency's assistance in coping with the flood of official visitors
coming to attend the funeral. Rusk agreed to call on
