the services of Colonel Valeriano available for a one-day
orientation in the latest techniques used in the field of
counterinsurgency. The trainees are well aware of the
general problems and history of fighting guerrillas and
are actively engaged in oporations at the present. It is
suggested that the instructions stress use of intelligence
in combatting guerrilla groups and ceana of procuring it
to include the creation of intelligence nets acang peasants
in the afflicted areas. It is also belioved that any
current information on modifications in the tactics of
Mao Tse-tung would also: be of value as would be examples
of the use of psychological warfare programs against the
guerrillas cud the intellectual leaders of the communiet
party, considered as the novlug force behind the guerrilla
novomentin Verozuolaji(It is proposed that Mr. Cavan 03
who would use the alias of "ill Cabal" fake the Te trafnees
to the office of Valorians and that Valeriano be introduced

Field. Through Mr. Ellio. Chief of the Ground Branch of
SOO, and Mr. Wall, of the same branch, one-half day
orientation course was given to the first trainees who
suggested that a full day vould be sufficient due to the
lovel of the above trainees and the experience they have
in this fiold.
9. Arrangemente have been made with Mr. Luria and
Mr. Eritz neko of TSD/Training to provido Major Lulu 06
Alfonso uchomwith chomwith a flaps and Souls course for the
period of 19-30 April at a TSD Safe House. It is believed
the Flure and Seals course will benefit CIA because it
will offor HERSCHOOL the opportunity to sintain closer
contact with ochon moil the responsible for this type
activity in SIA SIFA proposes to make a concertod
offort in the letter intercept fiold to koop botter
informed of the extrece loftist offorts to overthrow the
| Venezuelan government, and it is felt that HUILSCHWOOD
can keep abreast of the operation. Because of
SIFA'819
responsibilities, it is believed that the wore effiofent
effort that Sifcan gule in this field will result to
the benefit of CIA.Tinjor Ochon would take the first six
wooks of the covert training course then devote the last
two weeks to the Flops and Souls course.
10. It is also requested that TSO/Training provide
a one-day course in Audic Surveillance and flaps and
Seals for the other three trainees at the R & S Building.
This should be a very geuoral briefing with the least
possible omphasis on ocupiicated, expensive equipaout
that might be later requested by the trainces. It 10
believed this general introduction will give the IFA29
trainees some idea as to approaches and problema luvolved
in these fields as well as the pitfalls that should be
avoided. This one-day course was given to the first three
tratuses who appeared improused with the concepte expoand
to thea. This subject has also been discussed with Mr.
Luria ami a fira date has been selected for the training.
The OTit fustructor will accompany the trainees and act
as translator.
It is roquested that C1/CA obtalo permission
for the visitors to enter the it & S building for this
training which is scheduled for the 19th of April.
