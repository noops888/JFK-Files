Resume of Employment
Birch D. O'Neal
1. Attached is a proposed resume of my employment covering
the entire service to the U. S. Government.
2. I would propose to use this should the need arise.
However, I would not like to be restricted to the statements
therein. In 1968 I applied for admission to the Bar in the
District of Columbia and prepared a detailed response to
certain questions in the application. The information provided
at that time went on record and should the occasion arise, I
would like to be in a position to make the same statements.
I do not think that such a situation will occur, but if it
does, I would propose to support the attached resume with the
more detailed information attached hereto and which appeared
in that application.

RESUME
U. S. GOVERNMENT SERVICE
BIRCH D. O'NEAL
From January 10, 1938 on entering U. S. government service
as a Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to
February 28, 1970 (with exception of a few months in the fall
and winter of 1946-47) was employed by various Departments and
Agencies of the U. S. Government, including the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, U. S. Department of Justice, U. S. Department of
State, and Central Intelligence Agency. In this period of more
than 32 years steadily advanced in salary with commensurate
responsibilities from $3200 per annum to more than $30,000 per
annum while holding various titles including Special Agent,
Legal Attacho, Civil Attache, and Foreign Affairs Officer.
More than 12 years of this service was performed while stationed
abroad or in travel status in many foreign countries of Latin
America, Europe and Africa.
While the entire service involved utilization of legal
training and conduct of investigations affecting the national
security interests of the United States, that from September
-2-
1942 to February 1970 (voluntary retirement) also involved
direct supervision of investigative and clerical assistants
(on occasions more than 50 employees and expenditure of
extensive funds). The service also involved extensive liaison
with foreign government and other U. S. government officials.
Liaison on occasions, both domestic and foreign, related to
matters of the highest sensitivity and importance and accordingly
was conducted at highest levels (Cabinet and sub-Cabinet)..
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
February 1947 - March 1947. In February 1947 I entered on
duty with what was known as the Central Intelligence Group,
2430 E Street, N.W., Washington, D. C., a government body
created by Executive Order which was a predecessor to the
Central Intelligence Agency. I was a legal liaison officer
with this group.
March 1947 - December 1949. During this period I was
detailed to the U. S. Department of State, 20th Street and
Virginia Avenue, N.W., Washington, D. C., where I was assigned
to the U. S. Embassy, Caracas, Venezuela, as Attache. In that
capacity I prepared reports and advised and counselled the U.S.
Ambassador on matters of a legal and political nature. In
this work I employed legal knowledge, background and experience
as related to the laws of the United States and the Republic
of Venezuela.
Criteria
January 1950 to December 1951 Central Intelligence
Agency, 2430 E Street, N.W., Washington, D. C. In this
period I was assigned to duties involving liaison on legal
matters with other departments of the U. S. Government in-
cluding the Department of Defense, Department of Justice
(Immigration and Naturalization Service and Federal Bureau
of Investigation) and the Department of State.
for the position included knowledge, application and
interpretation of U. S. and foreign laws. The establishment
of the position was at the instance of the General Counsel
of the Agency and my selection to the position was with his
concurrence. The assignment required close working coordination
and collaboration with the General Counsel of the Agency and
other governmental legal counsel. I discontinued this
particular work to enable me to again undertake further assign-
ment with the Department of State as a member of the Foreign
Service Staff Corps.
December 1951 - April 1954 U. S. Department of State,
Foreign Service Staff, Washington, D. C. During this period
I served as Attache, Political Officer, American Embassy,
Guatemala City, Guatemala. In that capacity I gathered in-
formation concerning the legal system, laws, and enforcement
thereof and counselled and advised the U. S. Ambassador on
matters of a legal and political nature. In this work I
employed legal knowledge and experience as related to the
laws of the United States and the Republic of Guatemala.
resigned from this position in Guatemala to return to the
U. S. for personal and family reasons.
-2-
April 1954 to Present Central Intelligence Agency,
2430 E Street, N.W., Washington, D. C. I have been employed
with this Agency since April 1954 as a Foreign Affairs Officer.
In that capacity I have had regular, almost daily contact and
liaison with the Department of Justice and Department of State
representatives on matters of a legal and political nature.
My duties involve the application of knowledge and experience
in the legal field, both foreign and domestic.

states of Georgia and the District of Columbia on matters of
admission. They may not contact you but for your information
in case they do, attached are copies of Attachments B, D, E
and F of the application for admission which I filed in the
District recently. You will note that in the last paragraph
of Attachment B that services performed since April 1954 is
carried in the capacity of a Foreign Affairs Officer. This
had been agreed upon with Central Cover and primarily at their
instance and I did not think it would jeopardize my case if,
in fact, I could otherwise qualify under the experience pro-
visions of the District rules. In any event, the information
herein may be helpful to you in the event you are called upon
to respond to an inquiry.
3. I am sending copies of this and the attachments to
the Office of Security and Office of Personnel and I should
hope that any response from these various elements of the
-2-
Agency at least would be coordinated with the other respective
offices to avoid any confusion and difficulties for me in the
course of the investigation which will be made to determine my
qualifications for admission to the Bar in the District of
Columbia.
