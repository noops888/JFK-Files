1st Avenue is apparently the address of an apartment which
had been utilized by Cuban Power. This account contained a
receipt for rent on an apartment which has been used by
Cuban Power. It is presumed this apartment has been used

investigation of MORALES, who is currently incarcerated
in the Dade County Jail under local violation.

MANUEL PENABAZ
SA JAMES J. O'CONNOR developed the following
information from MM 1119-S on January 30, 1968( (21)
MANUEL PENABAZ has been in Miami for the past
couple of weeks. On January 26, 1968, he obtained a visa
at the Consulate of Venezuela in Miami for travel to the
Dominican Republic. He claims this travel is in connec-
tion with land sales.

:
PENABAZ stated he had clipped some newspaper
articles regarding recent activities of Poder Cubano and
had sent them to EDUARDO FERNANDEZ who is a Cuban cur-
rently serving as an officer in the U.S. Army believed
stationed in California, possibly at Fort Ord. PENABAZ
claimed that EDUARDO FERNANDEZ originated the idea or at
least the name of Poder Cubano and PENABAZ mentioned the
idea to FRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ TAMAYO and RICARDO MORALES.
PENABAZ claims that TAMAYO and MORALES are involved with
another group in the bombings at Miami. PENABAZ stated
there was a meeting at the residence of TAMAYO in Miami
during the week of January 21-27, 1968, which was attended
by several Cubans from New Jersey. TAMAYO reportedly
showed them arms, description not known. Also, those at
the meeting allegedly smoked marijuana. PENABAZ claims
ORLANDO BOSCH has nothing to do with Poder Cubano.
PENABAZ indicated he would be flying to the Dominican
Republic via Pan American on January 31, 1968. (1)

By memorandum dated February 13, 1968, CIA,

regarding JORGE GONZALEZ: (u)
On February 9, 1968, a contact of CIA advised
that he had, a conversation on the evening of February 7,
1968, with JORGE GONZALEZ, military chief of the
Hovimiento Insurreccional de Recuperacion Revolucionaria
(MIRR). GONZALEZ stated that the activities of the Cuban
Power group would continue. He said they intended to
"frighten" some members of the news media, such as NORMAN
DIAZ ARTILES and JUAN AMADOR RODRIGUEZ of Radio Station
WMIE, and SERGIO VIDAL CAYRO of Radio Station WFAB (W
GONZALEZ stated that they knew they were under
investigation by the FBI. He said the only evidence
against ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA during his trial for extortion
was that the threatening notes had been typed on a type-
writer to which BOSCH had access. For this reason, when
Cuban Power had something to write, they rented a type-
writer at the cost of $30.00 for the purpose.
said that different persons rented typewriters from
different places in order to elude the investigative
efforts of the FBI. (X))

GONZALEZ said that Cuban Power was preparing news
releases which would be sent to the local news media that
night (February 7). According to GONZALEZ, the MIRR and
ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA were preparing "an important work
about Cuba" which would reaffirm the position of the MIRR
so that there would be no connection between the MIRR and
Cuban Power. GONZALEZ said this action would allay the
suspicions of the FBI since it would appear that the MIRR
was inactive. (5) (4)

bombings which had occurred in Miami. FELIPE RIVERO,
of the CNM, commented regarding the recent bombings in Miami
that the only thing a bombing such as occurred recently in
Miami does is to take the medicine from the elderly and the
`children. RIVERO further stated that when he does something
he signs his name to it. JORGE MASCANOSA, representative of
RECE, would not talk against the bombings, however, at the
same time LUIS CONTE AGERO also refused to make any comments
regarding the bombings. CONTE stated, however, that he was
against sending any packages to Cuba except medicine.
The following investigation was conducted by
SA EDWIN PETER KRIEGER:
On January 26, 29 and 30, 1968, MM 1264-C was
contacted regarding Cuban Power and the recent bombings in
the Miami area.
Informant advised that he heard that a young group
of Cubans in the age category of 18 to 20 years of age have
been actually or personally involved in the local bombings in
the Miami area. He felt that Cuban Power was using these
young individuals in that they have no fear and they crave
excitement. He further said that he heard that ORLANDO
BOSCH is the leader of the Cuban Power group. He further
stated that he believes it is this same group that is
responsible for the bombing of B25 cargo aircraft at Miami
International Airport on January 20, 1968.
Informant continued by saying that a source for
the Cubans obtaining powder for any homemade bombs could be
through Maule Industries, Miami, which handles explosive
powder and this company hires many Cuban employees.
Informant said that he does rehabilitation work
with young Cubans and Puerto Rican male individuals and
that in contact with them he would remain alert to any
additional problems that may arise, especially the bombing
matters in the Miami area.

this was not BOSCH calling. The caller then excitedly stated
he wanted to speak to her husband and hung up without answering
her question. (1)
She advised that she has talked with ORLANDO BOSCH
AVILA on numerous occasions, both personally and on' the

OSCAR ANGULO REYES, 2900 N. W. 92nd Street, Miami,
Florida, made available the following information :
((1)
On December 14, 1967, ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA, prominent
Cuban exile leader who heads the Movimiento Insurreccional
de Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MIRR), advised the source
confidentially that the new Cuban exile organization called
"Cuban Power" was being created by "my men in New York City"
and indicated to the source that he would furnish more
information at a later date. ((1) (4)
On January 15, 1968, JORGE GONZALEZ, also known
as "Bombilla," one of BOSCH's Lieutenants in the MIRR and
Chief of the Military Department of the MIRR, advised the
source that he was a member of Cuban Power, whose objective:
was the stopping of the sending of parcels to Cuba. He
revealed that Cuban Power was responsible for the bombings
of the Post Offices at Elizabeth, New Jersey, on December 4,
1967; New York City, December 9, 1967; and Havana, Cuba,
January 8, 1968. He said in addition they had sent
explosive packages to "traitors among the exiles."
GONZALEZ stated that the top leaders of the MIRR were
running the Cuban Power organization and that within seven
or eight days they were going to cause an explosion which
would be heard all over the world
(1)
The source stated the above conversation with
GONZALEZ occurred at the offices of the Cuban Express.
Company, 1753 West Flagler Street, Miami, and while the
source and GONZALEZ were en route from the Cuban Express
Company to the "Segundo Caribe Supermarket," 35th Street
and N. W. 17th Avenue, Miami, where GONZALEZ' girlfriend
is employed.
The source advised the Cuban Express Company is
a shipping company engaged in shipment of parcels to Cuba
and the company is owned by PAULINO GUTIERREZ VIDAL.
GUTIERREZ VIDAL and his son, JORGE GUTIERREZ ULLA, are
members of the MIRR and are close associates of ORLANDO
BOSCH. BOSCH frequently meets with MIRR members at the

Cuban Express Company office and the source stated that
recent bombings by Cuban Power may be an effort to eliminate
competition, noting the Cuban Express Company is not one
of those companies which has been bombed to date
(X)(21)
On January 16, 1968, the source again visited the
Cuban Express Company office and talked with BOSCH, GUTIERREZ
VIDAL, and another Cuban male, name unknown, described as
Trigueno, about 25 years old, 5'6", stocky build, short black
hair combed straight back, and known to be a member of the
Military Department of the MIRR. During the ensuing
conversation, BOSCH confirmed that a bomb would be set off
by them within the next few days and stated he was then
leaving for South Miami via Highway Number 1 to pick up some
explosives. The source received the impression that both
PAULINO GUTIERREZ VIDAL and the Cuban male were involved in
this activity with BOSCH, since BOSCH spoke freely before
them.()(1)
On January 19, 1968, the source again visited the
Cuban Express office and talked with PAULINO GUTIERREZ VIDAL
who was alone. GUTIERREZ VIDAL appeared to be very excited
and stated, "The plane from Merida arrives today--stand by
for the next 24 hours--we will have big news for you."
GUTIERREZ indicated he had been in contact with FAUSTO DIAZ,
local manager of the Compania Aerea de Carga Yucatan, in
connection with his shipping business and that DIAZ had
informed him of the scheduled arrival and departure times
of the plane from Merida, Mexico.(*) (21)
On January 20, 1968, at approximately 3:00 AM,
according to information supplied to the source by his wife,
an unidentified male telephoned the home of the source and
talked with his wife. The caller reportedly told his wife to
tell him, "We put a bomb on the plane for Merida," after
which the caller hung up. The source stated his wife, who
is well acquainted with ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA, recognized the
caller's voice as that of BOSCH.

was told he had gone to the airport. The source's wife
inquired if this was not BOSCH calling, after which the
caller hung up. (X(U)
The source was of the opinion BOSCH did not
actually place the bomb on the B-25 cargo plane on January
20, 1968, but that this was probably effected by JORGE

FERRER said he knew the bombs planted recently
at the package shipment stores were placed by ATON CONSTANZO
PALAU and a Cuban Negro known only as "DOMEC." He stated
"DOMEC" is possibly identical with ROBERTO DOMEQ RODRIGUEZ,
INS Number A12 854 781. DOMEQ is a member of the group of
ROLANDO ARCADIO MASFERRER ROJAS, which was arrested in
January, 1967, in connection with the alleged attempted
invasion of Haiti.()(4)
FERRER also stated the entire Cuban Power movement
is under the control of ROLANDO MASFERRER.
A third member of the group is NESTOR RODDA MEOQUI,
aka Ernesto Rodda, born June 10, 1938. RODDA resides at 3450
S. W. 10th Street, Apartment 3, Miami, but he can also be
located at 3491 S. W. 11th Street, Apartment 1.

FERRER stated he observed ATON, DOMEQ and RODDA on
the night the last three bombs were planted. On the following
day, these three were in almost constant contact by phone and
took unusual precautions to prevent their phone conversations
from being overheard. ATON has reportedly told the Miami
Police Department and other law enforcement agencies he has
a cache of explosives, but that it is dynamite. FERRER
believes from what ATON has told him, the cache is actually
C-4 plastic explosive.u
FERRER also stated C-4 is for sale in the Miami area
by certain individuals not named in the Second National Front
of the Escambray and others, unnamed, who can get it from
New York and "Mafia" contacts, at $1.50 per pound, sold only
in 100 pound lots. FERRER also advised a large quantity of
acid-type time pencils from the same sources are available in
the Miami area.

ANDALL advised he desired any contact with VILLA FANAS
be made through CIA; however, these contacts can be made
immediately if and when they may be desired by the FBI
