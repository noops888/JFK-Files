Status of Document:
Postponed in Part
Number of releases of previously postponed information: 18

Dear Mrs. Thornell:
I am sorry you feel that you were not treated fairly upon
termination of your services with the Committee.
When I received your letter, I asked Tom Howarth to give
me a memorandum outlining the terms of your settlement.
Enclosed is a copy.
I am sure that after you read the memorandum, you will
agree that the Committee was more than fair, especially in
light of the fact there was no official leave policy at the
time and thus, no obligation to pay any terminating compen-
sation at all.
As to your main area of concern, the one-day break in
service, Mr. Howarth's memorandum points out that such a break
has no effect whatsoever on the transfer of your benefits.
I wish you every success in your new position with the
administration.
Sincerely,
Louis Stokes

DATE:

RE:
JOAN T. THORNELL, LETTER RE LEAVE
Mrs. Thornell left at the close of business
on Friday, May 13, 1977. As the Committee had no leave
policy at that time, she made her termination effective
Sunday, May 15, 1977, at my suggestion, so that she
would receive two days extra in pay.
Mrs. Thornell began employment November 8,
1976 and left May 13, 1977. Under the Clerk of the
House's leave policy, she would be entitled to 5 days,
no credit being given for a fraction of a month when
hired or a fraction of a month when terminated.
The Clerk's policy further states there
are no provisions to permit reimbursement to an employee
upon termination for any accumulation of leave. However,.
to the extent possible and practicable, every effort
should be made to consider such accumulation when sub-
mitting a recommendation for termination.
Twelve Committee Staff Members with a total
of 42 days accumulated leave who have terminated, in-
cluding one who terminated the same day as Mrs. Thornell,
were given no credit for their leave because the
Committee had no policy at that time.
This fact and the fact that Mrs. Thornell
was paid for six days past May 13, in my opinion, dis-
credits Mrs. Thornell claim to "the punitive nature of
the decision." The facts clearly show that Mrs.
Thornell was given special consideration.

For the record, Acting Chief Counsel Al Lewis
was paid for no accumulated leave. After Mr. Lewis left
the Committee, he was kept on the payroll long enough to
recover his back salary which I understand was the
Committee's request. (Mrs. Thornell had already recovered
her back salary.)
As to Mrs. Thornell's break in service, I
have been told by the Finance Office that such a break
has no effect whatsoever on the transfer of her benefits.

Chairman
Select Committee on Assassinations
U. S. House of Representatives
Washington, D. C. 20515
Dear Chairman Stokes:
The circumstances of my departure from the Committee staff
have saddened me because of the following:
On May 6, 1977, in writing (enclosed) I advised the then-
Acting Chief Counsel and Staff Director, Alvin B. Lewis, Jr.,
of my intention to leave the staff as of May 15, 1977 plus
whatever vacation time I had accrued since my date of entry to
service, November 8, 1976.
Since there was no formal leave policy established by the
Committee at the date of my notice and since I was aware of
leave being extended to the Acting Chief Counsel who was also
leaving service at about the same time, I began making inquiries
about my own accrued leave.
On Thursday, May 12, Thomas Howarth, the Budget Officer,
advised me verbally that he had not yet cleared with you the
rate of leave to be extended to me in days accrued per month,
but he thought that a rate of one day per month was going to
be approved. On that basis, he calculated that I would be
allowed 5 1/2 or 6 days of leave.
When I began a new appointment with a Federal agency on
Monday, May 23, I called Mr. Howarth from the new personnel
office to establish my date of termination in order to comply
with the Federal law which prohibits Federal employees from
receiving payment from more than one Federal source at a
time. In other words, I was attempting to clear the date of
May 23 as a starting date for the new employment.
At that time, Mr. Howarth advised that I had been terminated
on May 19, based on a calculation of leave beginning May 14 for
a total of 6 days which included counting weekend days in
the leave period. At the time of our initial conversation, how-
- 2 -
ever, I was not advised that weekend days would be counted in the
calculation of the leave period.
He further advised that since the House payroll system is
based on a 30-day month, for purposes of calculating a termination
date he counted weekend days, whereas a vacationing employee who
would be returning to work after vacation would not have weekend
days counted. (I checked with the Committee on House Administra-
tion and learned that though each Committee establishes its own
leave policy, it is unusual to penalize a terminating employee
by counting in weekend days.)
Inasmuch as there was no written leave policy I had no way
of anticipating his method of calculating leave. And because of
the punitive nature of the decision I have suffered a break in
service which may affect seriously my transfer of benefits from
the House of Representatives to my new employment. Had I been
aware of his method of calculating leave, my dates of departure
from the Committee, obviously, would have been different.
I hope that you will review the calculation of my date of
departure and act swiftly to rectify the situation to allow my
termination date from the Committee to be set at Friday, May 20,
1977, which would reflect 5 working days leave from the Committee.
I have already acted to begin employment at the Department
of the Treasury as of May 23. I gladly forfeit the 6th vacation
day which would have been May 23.
Thank you in advance for your kind attention to this matter
and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Sincerely,
Joan Talbert Thornell
