SOURCE INFORMATION
1. COS Lima did well to raise the question as to what will
happen, vis a vis our operational security, when the Cubans
achieve diplomatic recognition in the various Latin American
countries where this is gradually occuring. The responses
from the Branches indicate that we do have a considerable amount
of operational activity and equity that revolve around our Cuban
assets and that we would do well to begin a gradual cut-back in
our use of Cubans, given the targetting that we presume will be
made on then as the Cuban CI effort begins in the various
countries.
2. However, the solution to our problem should be a gradual
one and keyed initially to where the official Cuban presence is.
and then to those countries where it is coming. Therefore we
start with Peru.

a. GICITRON-4

R. LITHGOE, also a Cuban, who is nominally Subject's
partner in the business enterprise.
c.

d.
Legitimate businessman who was formerly in Mexico and
now manages a Mexican business firm in Bogota.
e. Resident alien of Colombia.
f.
Subject has received no training in clandestine opera-
tions, though he was involved in several clandestine
Cuban activities while treasurer of the 26th of July
Hoverent during 1957-53.
g.
Since Subject provides cover for LITHGOE, he is not
required to utilize any tradecraft. Having his own
company provides for adequate cover.
h. Due to his position, Subject is probably well-known in
the Cuban community, but he performs no operational
tasks.

REFERENCE: Your Memorandum, Dated
28 October 1970
A Provisional Operational Approval is granted for the use of this Subject
as set forth belos.
A Provisionel Operational Approval issued by CI Staff grants the same
authority, on a temporary basis, for the use of an ividual as the authority
granted in an Operational Approval unless otherwise specified by CI/OA. It is
based, however, only on preliminary file checks and investigation and is sub-
Ject to a further final review when all investigation is completed.
For limited use as requested in your mamo of 28 October 1970, the POA
is reinstated until 30 January 1971.
To process the Operational Approval, full information (completed PRQ
Parts I and II) must be submitted as soon as possible and not later than six
(6) months from this date. An Operational Approval will follow when all
investigation is completed and upon the receipt of satisfactory PRQ Parts I
and II. Cancellation must be requested if use of Subject by interested Di-
visions ceases.

1. We have received your memorandum of 22 October 1970
informing us that GICITRON-4's file has been closed. However,
from Bogota Station correspondence we know that GICITRON-4 is
still of operational interest and there is a strong probability
that the missing PRC Part II has been delayed by the recent
restriction on pouching material to and from the field.
2. It is requested that the file on GICITRON-4 be reopened
and his POA be extended for an additional 30 days to allow time
for the FRQ Part II to arrive or to be prepared if necd be.

ABADGE INDELING
1. We have been notified that the POA for GICITRON-4 was
cancelled on 22 October 1970 because ve failed to provide a
PRQ Part II showing the details of our present relations with
him. He made an attempt to complete this Part II here at the
desk, but found that there were too many items of information
that we do not have.
2. We have requested that GICITRON-4's POA be extended for
an additional 30 days to allow time to provide the Part II.
We indicated that perhaps the document has been delayed by the
recent pouch restrictions.
3. We would appreciate the receipt of the PRQ Part II within
the next 30 days. If it has crossed this dispatch in the mail,
please disregard this notice.
