IDENTIFICATION:
BACKGROUND :
APPROVAL
:
Yurily Ivanovich NOSENKO
NOSENKO, Yurily Ivanovich, a Soviet
KGB officer who defected in 1964 and
was subsequently involuntarily con-
fined in the U.S. by the Agency for
a period of approximately three years.
NOSENKO first contacted Agency per-
sonnel in Switzerland in June 1962
and subsequently defected in January
1964. NOSENKO was brought to the U.S.
and after a period of relative freedom,
he was involuntarily confined in
April 1964. From April 1964 to
August 1965, he was confined at an
Agency controlled site in Clinton,
Maryland. From August 1965 to
October 1967, NOSENKO was confined
at Camp Peary, Virginia. In October
1967, he was returned to the Washington
area, given increasing amounts of
freedom until he was given total free-
dom in April 1969. NOSENKO became a
U.S. citizen in April 1974. NOSENKO
was employed by the Agency as a
consultant in March 1969 and continues
under contract to date. His present
salary is $23,500 per year.
(1) The legal basis to confine NOSENKO
against his will was discussed by
Mr. Richard Helms, DD/P, and others with
the Deputy Attorney General on 2 April
1964 (Tab 1). On 3 April 1964, the
Agency General Counsel, Mr. Lawrence
Houston, advised the Director of Security
by memorandum that such confinement was
proper (Tab 2).
(2) There are a series of letters from
the DDCI, DCI and others to various
agencies, including the Department of
Justice and the White House, covering
the period 1964 to 1969, evidencing
awareness of these agencies of the
NOSENKO affair (Tab 3).
(3) The conditions of NOSENKO's confine-
ment were established by the Office of
Security (Tabs 4 & 5).
RESULTS
:
By memorandum dated 2 October 1968,
the Director of Security forwarded
two reports to the DDCI summarizing
the results of the NOSENKO case to
that date. The reports are voluminous.
One was prepared by the Office of
Security and the other by the FBI.
Both reports conclude that NOSENKO
was a bona fide defector. A draft
memorandum attached to this file,
dated 21 October 1968 and prepared
by the CI Staff, raises question
regarding NOSENKO's bona fides
and challenges the above two reports.
TERMINATION :
NOSENKO continues under contract to
the Agency. He is brought to Washington
periodically to consult on matters
germane to his background and experience.
Various reports are available in the
files of the Office of Security which
detail financial aspects of this case.
No final accounting has been made since
the project continues.
COMMENTS
(1) While the Office of Security files
do document the rationale for the original
confinement of NOSENKO, they do not
document the rationale for his continued
confinement over so long a period of time.
A memorandum dated 5 August 1969 states
that various congressional staff officers
were briefed on NOSENKO and states that
concern for his safety, as well as con-
cern regarding his bona fides, prompted
the prolonged confinement. (See Tab 6)
(2) Office of Security files document
a period in 1969 during which a mail
cover was placed on NOSENKO.
(3) During the above period, NOSENKO
was allowed a pleasure trip to Florida.
During this trip, Agency personnel, with
apparent Headquarters approval, obtained
the services of prostitutes. This
apparently occurred on at least two
occasions.
FILES

Office of Security files on NOSENKO
are maintained in the following

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD
SUBJECT: Discussion with Deputy Attorney
General on Nosenko Case
1. Mr. Helms, Mr. Houston and Mr. Murphy met with
the Deputy Attorney General and members of his staff to
discuss subject case. Present from Mr. Katzenbach's
staff were Messrs. Foley, Yeagley and Reis.
2. Mr. Helms explained the Nosenko case briefly
and indicated that shortly we would be faced with what
we at least considered to be two problems on which we
would like the advice of the Department of Justice.
First, we would soon feel compelled to begin hostile
interrogation of Nosenko in order to arrive at the truth
with respect to his mission for the KGB and we wondered
what the legal position would be in circumstances in
which we detained Nosenko against his will for this pur-
pose. Second, we would have to be ready after determin-
ing that we could obtain no additional information from
Nosenko to deport him. We had thought of taking him to
Germany and transferring him to Soviet custody in Berlin
where this has been done a number of times in the past.
3. There was some discussion of whether deportation
to another country might be a consideration. Mr. Helms
explained we would probably face publicity problems in
deporting to a third country of the kind we would en-
counter if he were free in the U. S. Mr. Helms noted
there were many items of information which we and the
FBI realize are of no significance because of the file
holdings we have but which an unscrupulous newspaper man
could use to create mischief. This aspect was then dropped
and it was the consensus that Berlin was probably the best
place.
4. The question of the basis for detention was again
raised and related by Mr. Foley to the conditions under
which Nosenko is in this country. He is here as an "ex-
clusion and parole case" which means he has not been
admitted and has been paroled to the Agency which is
responsible for him while he is in this country. This
SECRET
EYES ONLY
parole can be interpreted to mean parole to a specific
locale which would provide some justification for our
detaining him for questioning. It was then pointed out,
however, that if he said he wished to leave the country
to return to the Soviet Union, technically we would not
be able to detain his further. In this event, we would
be faced with the need to deport him quickly and quietly
and for this purpose the immigration warrant of arrest
and deportation was probably the best instrument.
5. Mr. Katzenbach asked Mr. Foley to check into
this and Mr. Foley will in turn contact Mr. Houston.
Mr. Houston will in turn discuss the problem with CIA
Office of Security officials to get the background of
their liaison with the INS on these matters.
6. Mr. Helms thanked Mr. Katzenbach for his assistance
and we departed amid some jovial banter with respect to
"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold" about what we expected
to happen to him when he started to climb over that "wall"
in Berlin.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Security
SUBJECT: Parole Status of Defectors
1. On 2 April 1964 we had a discussion with the Department
of Justice on the status of aliens whose inspection by I&NS is deferred
upon arrival at our request and who are then paroled to this Agency.
It was the position of the Department of Justice that we were responsible
for taking any action necessary to carry out the terms of the parole.
2. As you know, a basic parole agreement was executed by the
Attorney General and the DCI on 10 February 1955. After setting up
conditions for authorizing parole in any one case, the agreement states:
"After parole of such aliens, the Central Intelligence Agency will assume
responsibility for care, supervision and control of a kind and degree it
believes consistent with the internal security needs of the United States
during continuance of their parole status." This means that the
responsible Agency officials must take the minimum action necessary
to protect the internal security needs of the United States. The word
"minimum" is not necessarily a limitation. It merely means that good
judgment must be used as to what kind and degree of action is necessary.
3. The agreement further provides that upon completion of the
parolee's intelligence or operational purposes in the United States or if
internal security reasons so require, the alien will be removed from
this country through arrangements made by the Agency and, in such
case, the Agency will inform the Service in advance of each proposed
departure.

1. Information that NOSENKO had defected and was in the United
States in February 1964 was known to appropriate agencies and articles
had appeared in the public media.
2. NOSENKO was in the United States under an I&NS parole as
the responsibility of CIA. The FBI was fully advised of the presence of
NOSENKO in the United States and interviewed NOSENKO on several
occasions in March 1964. The United States Intelligence Board was
also formally advised on 12 February 1964 concerning the defection of
NOSENKO. On 14 February 1964, NOSENKO was interviewed by Soviet
officials/and NOSENKO reaffirmed his previous request for asylum in
the United States.

Dear Mr. Helms:
Re: Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko
(ER 69-5003/1)
Reference is made to your letter dated October 9, 1969,
concerning the above case, in which you urge the concurrence
of the Attorney General in your proposal to have the above-
named alien admitted for permanent residence in the United
States in accordance with the provisions of Section 7 of the
Central Intelligence Act of 1949, as amended.
The Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization has
informed me that on the basis of the records of his Service
and the information furnished by you, and in the absence of
any other evidence adverse to the alien, he concurs in your
proposal that the alien be permitted to enter the United
States for permanent residence under the authority of the
foregoing statute.
Upon the basis of all the evidence received for consid-
eration and your statement of recommendation and approval
which carries with it your determination that the entry of the
individual concerned is in the interest of national security
and in the furtherance of the national intelligence mission,
I concur in your recommendation that the admission for perma-
nent residence of the subject alien be authorized under the
provisions of Section 7 of the Central Intelligence Agency
Act of 1949, as amended.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. McGeorge Bundy
SUBJECT: Yuri Ivanovich NOSENKO
1. This memorandum refers to the State Department
release of 10 February on subject case and provides addi-
tional background as well as information on his current
status.
2. As a KGB staff officer, NOSENKO is regularly
assigned to the Counterintelligence Directorate of the
KGB in Moscow but was included in the Soviet delegation
to the Disarmament Conference as part of a cover arrange-
ment which permitted him to carry out intelligence and
security functions in Geneva on behalf of the KGB.
3. NOSENKO also attended various sessions of the
Disarmament Conference held in Geneva in 1962. During the
course of these sessions, NOSENKO sought contact with
officials of the U. S. Government, informed these officials
that he was affiliated with the Soviet State Security ap-
paratus and volunteered to aid the U. S. Government in
detecting Soviet subversive activity directed against the
U. S. Government. During the course of his contact with
U. S. authorities, NOSENKO stated that his cooperation with
the U. S. Government originated with his distaste and hatred
for the Soviet regime in general, with his desire to obtain
revenge for the unjust death of his father, a senior official
in the Soviet shipbuilding industry, and with the general
admiration of the Americans with whom he had come in con-
tact within the Soviet Union.
4. In late January 1964, NOSENKO arrived in Geneva,
again masquerading as a member of the Soviet delegation
to the Disarmament Conference. Subject secretly notified
his CIA contacts in the United States concerning his pres-
ence in Geneva and arranged to meet with those contacts.
During a series of meetings, NOSENKO provided information
including documents concerning Soviet State Security acti-
vities within the USSR and abroad and a detailed account

During these most recent meetings, NOSENKO announced
his desire to leave the USSR permanently and seek his future
in the West. He claimed his new work in the KGB (First
Deputy Chief of that department charged with the surveillance
and recruitment of American visitors to the USSR) was ex-
panding and that he would not be able to visit the West
with any frequency. Accordingly, he prepared a request for
political asylum in the United States. He was taken to
Frankfurt, Germany where he is currently undergoing interro-
gation. Plans are now being made to remove him to the U.S.
6. It should be noted that CIA contact with Subject
has not been extensive and that we will require additional
thorough interrogation to establish Subject's bona fides.
It should also be noted that NOSENKO's duties were not con-
cerned with substantive aspects of the Disarmament Conference,
and he therefore is not expected to be able to shed much, if
any, light on that area of our interest.
7. The possibility that NOSENKO's defection was de-
signed to wreck the conference was most carefully considered.
The decision to accept his was taken on the conviction that
the Soviets would not have chosen such a vulnerable agent
(staff officer of the KGB) for this kind of move.
