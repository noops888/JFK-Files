was a very serious matter, porticularly so since they are not yet PBPRIME
citizens. Sufliceth to say both were shaken considerably over the prospect
that we might make the attached information available to ODURGE.
4. To the extent possiblo, JMWAVE is requested to inform future

The two PBRUMEN pilot trainces arrived in Iden hon 4 May
1965. Helicopter training started on 6 May and terminated 15 May
Iden Barrived at t the training area 9 May to receive briefings and
familiarization in all aspects WITHRUSIL helicopter project. Iden B
departed 12 May 1965.
2. The surrounding area of Iden A and Iden Cwas utilized as the
training site with most of the training taking place a fes ciles south
of Iden C. The local cover story was that IUPACAN was training pilots
with view of using them to ferry helicopters to northwestern PEPRIME,
where they would be utilized by IUPLAK. Cover story was backstopped.
through Iden D and Iden E (cleared and KUBARK witting). There were
no security problems encountered during the training period. Some
of the precautions taken were use of alias identification, first name
basis for everyone, payment by cash, luggage tags and tickets secured,
and close but subtle supervision of of the students by the case officer.
3. Following is a resume of helicopter training and familiarization
received by each student. Included are instructor pilot and case officer
evaluations:"
IDEN F
a. Iden F received training in all normal helicopter maneuvers,
pre-flight, post-flight and cockpit procedures. Additional training
was as follows:
1) Radio procedures with UHF, VHF, HF and LF ADF
2) Dead reckoning and cross-country 4+10 hours.
3) Personnel rappelling, personnel parachuting and use
of cargo slings-2+00 hours.

b. Prior to his arrival at the training site Iden F received
12+20 hours of dual flying instruction on pre-flight maneuvers and
emergency procedures, which included 4 hours of autorotation.
:
c. The language barrier between student and instructor retarded
the student's progress to some extent. His navigation, flight plan-
ning and weight and balance work is limited. It is recommended that
he have access to a helicopter each day in order to buildup his time.
d. The student was willing, cooperative and intelligent.
IDEN G
a. Iden G's training schedule included much of the same material
as that of Iden F except that his personnel rappelling, parachuting
and sling work amounted to 1+35 hours. His cross-country time a-.
mounted to approximately 1+50 hours.

с. The instructor pilet reports that Iden 6 has progressed
exceptionally well and that his pilot background is very good.
Iden G contributed substantially to Iden P's training.
d. It should be noted that Iden G received instruction and
50 hours flight time in a 476381 helicopter during helicopter
training conducted by IUFAGAN 27 March
15 April 1965.

IDEN B
SECRET
SECRET
3-
LA PA-0101
a. Iden B received training which exposed him to all aspects
of Bell 47G3B1 helicopter flight and support requirements.
b. The flight familiarization included almost all of the
normal helicopter maneuvers along with radio procedures. His
total flight time amounted to 5+30 hours. Both instructor pilots
noted that his flying procedures were rough, but were improving
steadily. He did not solo inasmuch as both pilots indicated that
he was not ready for solo..
c. Iden B wash given approximately 9 hours orientation in
helicopter maintenance and from 3-4 hours of orientation with re
gard to the contents of the support kits and accessory equipment.
d. Complete assessment of this individual is difficult to
make, as he was only in the training area for a short period of
time. However, the following information may be helpful in making
an evaluation:
1) Flying proficiency in 476381 is below par at this time.
He requires more dual and emergency procedures..
2) His conversation and experience indicates that he is
more knowledgeable of Hughes equipment than he is of Bell
equipment.
3) Iden B appears to be a very extroverted type of in-
dividual. In any conversation he does most of the talking.
4) The instructor pilots felt that his knowledge of hel-
icopters leaned to the "manual" side rather than the practical
side. He seemed, according to the instructor pilot, to have
a "shallow" knowledge of helicopter operations.
4. The case officer for the WITHRUSH pilot training was Alfred F..
PELANDER. Instructor pilots were Iden H and Alexander V. DECLIPPIE.

Objectives:

The primary purposes of this program was to prepare two WITHRUSH
employees (Iden A and Iden B) to operate a 476381 Bell Helicopter under
scue and reconnaissance
simulated tactical situations involving rescue
erations. Secondarily, Idens A and B were to be familiarized to the
fullest extent with the operational capability of the helicopter and
its accessory equipment. Iden A did not prove adaptable to this type
of aircraft and failed to complete transition training. Iden B com
plete transition training. Iden B completed the prescribed training,
evidencing consistent performance progress as well as alertness, in-
dependence and a cooperative attitude.
2.
Period of Training:
Training commenced for Iden A on 15 March and for Iden B. on 27
March. Iden B's training was satisfactorily completed on 15 April. A
total of 50 hours of training time was logged during the entire course
of instruction.
3.
Instructors:
The training instructors utilized were Alexander. V. DECLIPPEL and
Iden C. IUPAGAN PDO's provided training as to cargo sling operation,
rappelling and operational capabilities of special equipment.

Sound operational security practices were employed in the handling
of Idens A and B as to relationship with the general public. It was
not necessary for either the instructors or the students to refer to IU......
FLAG in dealings with the general püblic. A logical cover of training
for IUPEAK operations sufficed to handle any local inquiries concerning
reasons for the aircraft's being in the vicinity or the purposes of the
training. No known breaches of securyty as to identity of personnel or
the true purposes of the training occurred.

12) Limited and restricted solo
Critique:
a. The training program should be formalized to a greater degree.
A syllabus of items to be covered has been prepared and reviewed by
Alevander V. DECIPPEL. A copy of this syllabus is attached and it is
felt will assist in providing a guide to the instructor and permit a
more orderly procedure and better utilization of time epended. It can
be adapted easily as a statistical report covering training.
b. The training areas utilized from a standpoint of terrain, climate
and accessibility for maintenance proved acceptable.
