We previously have been informed that the subject is a
high-ranking official in the Cuban G-2 organization in Havana. On (5)
10/8/63, Mrs. Anita Potocki, a CIA analyst who has been working
on intercepted Cuban communications intelligence traffic Sadvised
the Liaison Agent that her Agency has come to the tentative conclu-
sion that Pineiros identical with Petronio, who has been men-
tioned in messages made available to the Bureau and CIA. We have
noted that messages sent to the unidentified Cuban Agent in Panama
referred to as "Roberto" have been signed by "Petronio7" (8
5)
Mrs. Potocki gave the following explanation which led to
CIA's deduction.
(4)
Messages emanating from Havana indicated that one of the
recipients was probably located in a small town in Colombia near the
Venezuelan Border. CIA developed a suspect and instituted coverage.
Recently, this individual transmitted a letter to Havana which
communication was intercepted by CIA.. The person had apparently
violated instructions by including some sensitive data in the
communication. Havana then transmitted a radio message castigating
the Cuban Agent in Colombia. An examination of the the radio message
and he intercepted communication sent by the Agent has led CIA
to believe that "Petronio" is identical with Pineiro (S)
