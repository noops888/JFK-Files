US address: c/o Jose Deetjen, 14746 East 57th Street, Apartment 3,

2. Source said he formerly belonged to the DRF, but after Playa
Ciron it disintegrated. Nevertheless, he said, he was able to keep in
contact with a few DRF people who are in Havana. He said details on the
DRF could be obtained from Manuel Salvat, but he did state that he belonged
to the DRF group headed by a brother of Diaz Lanz. This brother is still
in Havana. He said this group wants to engage in political assassination,
and has repeatedly requested that pistols with silencers be sent from
the United States.

3. Source said that his cousin, Salvador Jomolca, is a guerrilla
leader in Las Villas Province, more specifically operating between
Matanzas and Corralillo. He said that his cousin is a lieutenant about
30 years old. He has a small group, few arms, and very little ammunition.
He is trying to get outside help but there is no method of communicating
with him.

4. Source said that Salvador Jomolca is married to a daughter
of "Campito", the elder. (Comment: A previous source reported that
there are two "Campito"s, a father and his son. The son is the most
reported upon guerrilla leader, the father apparently only accompanying
the son.)
