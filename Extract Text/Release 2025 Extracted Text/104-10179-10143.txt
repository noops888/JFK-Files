1. JEREMY X BENADUM, WHO HANDLES LITEMPO VISA CHANNEL, BELIEVES
PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE GET MEXICAN VISA BY APPROACHING MEXICAN CONSUL
MIAMI OR SJAN. PROBLEM IS GETTING GOBERNACION VISA PERMIT. GOBERNACION
HAS LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF APPLICATIONS STACKED UP ON WHICH ACTION
NORMALLY BUROCRATICALLY SLOW ANYWAY AND ON WHICH GOBERNACION DOES NOT
REALLY DESIRE TAKE ACTION, BECAUSE OF DANGER CUBANS WILL BECOME PUBLIC
CHARGES. BEST CHANCE IS FOR ANY HIGH LEVEL MEXICAN OFFICIAL IN MEXICO
CITY FRONT FOR AMBANG-1 AND FOLLOW UP CASE CLOSELY THROUGH GOBERNACION.
NEXT BEST CHANCE IF A-1 HAS NO SUCH HIGH LEVEL CONTACT IS TO USE
ANY CUBAN FRIEND OF HIS MEXI WHO HAS SUCH HIGH LEVEL MEXICAN CONTACT.
THIS IS USUAL METHOD. USE OF STATION LITEMPO CHANNEL WOULD NOT
24.
NECESSARILY BURN ODYOKE INTEREST IN A-1 BECAUSE HICH LEVEL GOBERNACION
24
24,01
OFFICIALS SOMETIMES KNOWINGLY USE LITEMPO VISA CHANNEL THEMSELVES 24
FOR "PERSONAL INTEREST CASES AND MIGHT VERY WELL BE USING THE CHANNEL
THEMSELVES IN A-1'S CASE. IF BY COINCIDENCE A-1'S CUBAN FRIEND MEXI
HAPPENED TO APPROACH THEM. STATION HAS NOT DISCOURAGED SUCH USE
