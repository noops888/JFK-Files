ALLEGED CUBAN PLAN TO
ASSASSINATE PRESIDENT OF
PANAMA
At 4:55 PM, March 17, 1964, Orlando Piedra,
formerly connected with Federal Police in Cuba and
presently residing New Orleans, Louisiana, advised
that about one week ago he received information from
a source in Cuba whom he considers reliable that Castro
is not catisfied with the way things are going in Panama
and for that reason plans to have the President of Panama
assassinated to create additional uprisings in that
country. Piedra advised that he furnished the above
information by letter to Cclonel Eolivar Ballarino,
Chief of the National Guard of Panama whom he has known
for years. Piedra declines to identify the source and
has no additional information to report.
