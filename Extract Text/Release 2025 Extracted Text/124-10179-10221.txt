BLACK PANTHER PARTY
FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY FOR SELF-DEFENSE
CHARACTERIZATION OF SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZATION
EXTREMIST MATTER BLACK PANTHER PARTY
The Black Panther Party (BPP), organized in December,
1966, at Oakland, California, by Huey P. Newton and Bobby George
Seale, has the publicly-stated purpose of organizing black
people to take control of the life, politics and destiny of
the black community. The Party, operating the Black Panther
Intercommunal News Service, publishes a newspaper called
"The Black Panther," which at one time openly advocated the
use of guns and guerrilla tactics in a revolutionary program
to end the oppression of the black people but since early
1971 has spoken for a survival program pending revolution.
BPP national headquarters, aka Black Panther Intercom-
munal Headquarters, is located in Oakland, California.
While openly advocating direct overthrow of the
U. S. Government by force and violence until 1971, leaders
have since avoided extreme statements in favor of calling
for action within the established order. Newton, in an
interview appearing in the May, 1973, issue of "Playboy"
magazine, stated the Panthers' chief ambition is to change
the American Government by any means necessary but that
ultimately such change will be through armed violence.
Despite its claimed dedication to community service,
indicators of the BPP's continued attraction to violence persist.
Since July, 1974, Newton and other BPP members have been arrested
in Oakland, California, for threatening police officers,
murder of a 17-year-old female and the pistol whipping of
Newton's tailor. Newton failed to appear on these charges and
is now a local fugitive. Additionally, one died and three
were wounded as a result of a shooting at a BPP-sponsored
dance in Oakland, California, in October, 1974.

Couestion A
The Secret Army Organization (SAO) was clandestinely
formed during the Fall of 1971 in Arizona. Membership to date
has been small and it appears to have the same basic terets as.
the Minutemen. In fact, several of those involved in SAO
were formerly active in the Minutemen. The mail drop for
this organization reportedly is in care of an individual in
Ramona, California, who has been involved in Minutemen and
white-hate activities in the past.
This ultraconservative paramilitary organization
was recently involved in extremist activities in San Diego,
California. Members of this group reportedly made threatening
telephone calls to a local college professor who is active
in a group which plans to organize demonstrations at the
forthcoming Republican National Convention. Following these
telephone calls, a member of SAO fired shots from an auto-
mobile into the professor's home, wounding a guest.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY
INFORMATION CONCERNING
Information was received from Inspector Francis
Johnson, Alexandria, Virginia Police Department on February
27, 1969 to the effect that an unknown source of information
to the Alexandria, Virginia Police Department had recently
been approached by persons, which that source described as
Black Panther members, had requested the floor plans for
Hunter's Haven, also known as Potomac Arms, located at 0
Prince Street Alexandria, Virginia. This company conducts
business in the sale of firearms and ammunition.
The Alexandria, Virginia Police Department estab-
lished appropriate surveillance at this company, and an un-
known person was seen to cut through the cyclone fence ap-
proximately 7:30 P.M. on March 1, 1969, and thereafter crawl
under the building. An attempt was made by this individual
to saw a hole through the floor of the building, but the
would-be burglar was hampered in his sawing operation by guns
and cases, which obstructed his sawing as well as the cold
and water under the building. He was seen to depart through
the hole in the fence, which he then temporarily repaired.
He was not successful in gaining access to the building nor
in obtaining any weapons. No arrests were made, hoping that
accomplices would also be involved.
Inspector Johnson advised on March 3 and March 10,
1969 that the police have a "monitoring device" at the build-
ing, which will alert them at the police headquarters to any
unusual noises after working hours, inasmuch as they have
withdrawn their surveillance team. He stated that the source
of information is not a member of the Black Panthers, but
that the source continues to describe the burglars as such.
A characterization of the Black Panther Party is
attached hereto.

ENCLOSURE
BLACK PANTHER PARTY
According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther
Party (BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland,
California, to organize black people so they can take control
of the life, politics, and the destiny of the black community.
It was organized by Bobby George Seale, BPP Chairman, and
Huey P. Newton, BPP Minister of Defense. Newton is presently
serving a sentènce of 2 to 15 years on a conviction of man-,
slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police
officer.
The official newspaper, "The Black Panther", which
further describes itself as the "Black Community News Service,"
states that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla
tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression of the
black people. Residents of the black community are urged to
arm themselves against the police who are consistently re-
ferred to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.
"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968,
contains an editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George
Mason Murray, which ends with the following:
"Black men. Black people, colored persons of
America, revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture
worth keeping is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom
everywhere. Dynamite! Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the
pigs everywhere."
Included in the introduction to an article appear-
ing in the October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther"
is the statement, "... we will not dissent from American
Government. We will overthrow it."
Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain
quotations from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the
People's Republic of China and feature MAO's statement that
"political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.

The national headquarters of the BPP is located
at 3106 Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have
been established at various locations throughout the United
States.

basis with the Intelligence Unit of the Michigan State
Police and the Special Investigations Bureau of the
Detroit Police Department, both having direct interest in
local black nationalist activities and conduct surveillances
in regard to key black nationalist figures in the Detroit
area. Racial informants, who are familiar with the black
nationalist activity in the Detroit area, are contacted often
in regard to an organized BPP in the Detroit area. Contact
with the above sources has revealed that no organized BPP
has been established in the Detroit area wherein the BPP is
holding regular scheduled meetings.
In the event any information is received to show
that a BPP is organized and meeting at a regularly scheduled
time, the Bureau and other appropriate offices will be
properly advised.

Luke Tripp stated that the Black Panther Party is
not a party that adheres to violence but is geared towards
political education for the black people. Tripp stated that
the Black Panther Party is running Eldridge Cleaver, leader
of the BPP in San Francisco, California, for the presidency
of the United States in Michigan. Cleaver is being sponsored
by the New Politics Party. Tripp stated that the BPP is not
interested in seeking or getting votes, rather it is concerned
with presenting its program for revolution to the American
people. Tripp stated that social turmoil as manifested by
George Wallace, youth rebellions and riots in the streets,
can be blamed on power being in the hands of the establishment
and not in the hands of the people where it belongs. Tripp
stated that the black economic, political and social condition
as opposed to the condition of the whites is far below normal.
The system has as its basis a cast system based on race.
is the relationship of the oppressor and the oppressed, superior
to the inferior. Tripp stated that socially the black man
is unable to control his destiny. School, police and welfare
are all in the hands of the white people and the black people
must grasp for what is left.
It
Tripp further stated the BPP has a ten point program
that is geared towards elevating the black people out of the
slums. He further stated that the BPP in the Detroit area is
in the process of organizing a party and at this point has no
definite meeting place or date. However, any persons interested
in assisting the organization of the BPP in the Detroit area
may do so by contacting Luke Tripp or Leonard Brown.

Re: Black Panther Party
Detroit Division
Leonard Brown mentioned the fact that the white
policemen must realize that the black people are not
afraid of them and will defend themselves in any criticai
situation. Brown mentioned the fact that a good example of
the white police officer is the incident that occurred in
New York City where 200 white off-duty policemen attacked
innocent members of the EPP. Brown further stated that the
black political leaders in the country are nothing but
"phonies" and "Uncle Toms". He further stated it is time
for the white power structure to realize that it is impossible
to dictate to the black people as they have been doing for
years and that the black people only want a chance to govern
their community as they see fit.
Victor Stewart stated that the BPP in its useful
state is not an "underground party" but an "above the ground
party". Stewart stated that the only way the black people can
excel or exist in this world controlled by the white man is to
take what he wants. Stewart stated that this does not mean
asking or getting on your knees begging the white power
structure. He further stated that the key to the black man's
destiny is through black political education classes in
which he will be cognizant of the political structure in this
country. Stewart further stated that the BPP's motto is
"All power to the people; Black power to black people".
Marian Kramer, Negro, female, stated that the black
female must awaken and play a vital role in organizing the
BPP. She stated for years the black female has been neglected
from the political system in our country.
Sources in the Detroit area who are familiar with
the black nationalist movement, stated that they have no
information at this time that a BPP is organized in the
Detroit area and conducts regular scheduled meetings.
These
sources further advised that during other black militant
organizational meetings the name Black Panther Party has come
up; however, no significant meaning as to actually being
established in the Detroit area is known.

APPENDIX
BLACK PANTHER PARTY, also
known as Black Panther Party
for Self Defense
A source advised that the Black Panther Party for
Self Defense (BPPSD) was formed by HUEY PERCY NEWTON, Minister
of Defense, and BOBBY GEORGE SEALE, Chairman, in December,
1966, as a militant black nationalist political organization
to combat "police brutality", to unite militant black youth,
and to determine the destiny of black communities. The
political philosophy was taken from writings of Chairman MÀO
Tse-tung of Communist China and black militant writers.
In March, 1968, the name of the organization was
changed to Black Panther Party (BPP).
The official BPP publication, "The Black Panther
Party
Black Community News Service", states that the BPP
advocates use of guns and guerrilla tactics in their violent
revolutionary program to end oppression of black people.
On February 17, 1968, ELDRIDGE CLEAVER, Minister of
Information, announced merger of the BPP and Student Non-violent
Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and bestowed title of Minister of
Justice, BPP, upon H. RAP BROWN, Chairman of SNCC.
SNCC is a militant Negro organization
which preaches black supremacy.
NEWTON, aforementioned, is incarcerated in the loneda
County Jail, Oakland, California, awaiting trial on charge of
murder of an oskland police officer.
Headquarters of BPP and Huey P. Newton Defense Fund
are located at 4421 Grove Street, Oakland, California.
NW 88296 Docld:32989574 Page 27
STUDENT NON-VIOLENT COORDINATING COMMITTEE
The Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC),
headquartered at 360-362 Nelson Street, S.W., Atlanta, Georgia,
is a non-membership organization, which was born out of the
sit-in movement that erupted across the South beginning in
1960.
Today SNCC identifies itself as an organization in the
revolutionary vanguard. It advocates that to be successful it
is necessary to develop a revolutionary ideology and revolutionary
program.
According to SNCC, the year 1967 marked a historic
milestone in the struggle for the liberation of black people
in the United States and the year that revolutionaries throughout
the world began to understand more fully the impact of the
black movement. SNCC declared that "liberation will come only
when there is final destruction of this mad octupus--the capitalis-
tic system of the United States with all its life-sucking
tentacles of exploitation and racism that choke the people of
Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The realities of black life,
together with the recognition instilled in SNCC workers forced
its members to further popularize the legitimacy of self-
defense and rebellious when oppression became too great."
From May, 1966, until May, 1967, STOKELY CARMICHAEL
was National Chairman of SNCC. As of July, 1968, CARMICHAEL
resided in Washington, D.C., where he was affiliated with
SNCC and active as temporary chairman of a black coalition group.
In May, 1967, CARMICHAEL was replaced by HUBERT GEROID BROWN,
commonly known as H. RAP BROWN, who served until June, 1968.
In June, 1968, at the Staff and Central Committee
meeting of SNCC held in Atlanta, Georgia, it was decided to
restructure the organization by equalization of responsibility
by creating ten deputy or vice chairmanships. The primary
purpose for this change is to take law enforcement pressure
off any single individual.
NW88296 Docld:32989574 Page28
BLACK PANTHER PARTY (BPP)
also known as
Black Panther Party for Self Defense
According to the official newspaper of the BPP, the BPP
was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to
organize black people so they can take control of the life,
politics, and the destiny of the black community. It was
organized by BOBBY G. SEALE, BPP Chairman, and HUEY P. NEWTON,
Minister of Defense, BPP.
The official newspaper, called "The Black Panther,"
regularly states that the BPP advocates the use of guns and
guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression
of the black people. Residents of the black community are
urged to arm themselves against the police who are consistently
referred to as "pigs" who should be killed.
The newspaper, in its issue of September 7, 1968, had an
article by the then Minister of Education, GEORGE MURRAY.
This article ended with the following:
"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,
revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture
worth keeping is revolutionary culture. Change.
Freedom everywhere. Dynamite! Black power. Use
the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."
The BPP newspaper, issue of October 5, 1968, had an
article introduced with the following statement: "We will
not dissent from American government. We will overthrow it."
DAVID HILLIARD, Chief of Staff, BPP, in a speech at the
San Francisco Polo Field on November 15, 1969, said "We will
kill Richard Nixon."
DAVID HILLIARD, in the "New York Times," issue of
December 13, 1969, was quoted as follows: "We advocate the
very direct overthrow of the government by way of force
and violence."
In the issue of April 25, 1970, the BPP newspaper had
an article by Minister of Culture EMORY DOUGLAS as follows:
"The only way to make this racist US government administer
justice to the people it is oppressing, is...by taking
up arms against this government, killing the officials,
until the reactionary forces...are dead and those that
are left turn their weapons on their superiors, thereby
passing revolutionary judgement against the number one
enemy of all mankind, the racist US government."
The BPP Headquarters is located at 1046 Peralta Street,
Oakland, California. Branches of the BPP, and Committees to
Combat Fascism, under control of the BPP, have been established
in various locations in the USA.
