In abort, no one knows how many potential prebiams for UB foreiga
policy -- and how each potentiel friction with friendly states -- are
being created at this moment by CIA clandestina intelligence operation
Surely there is on argument fex permitting Stats to decide whether the

weighn the rick (6.5., arsuperating the local government and shaking

It has meant too that the State Depertment, ates aparicad ed an
operation only in ite later stagen, is under great pressure to
endorse the operation as already mounted because of the alleged
evil consequences of exorcistus a vete. I wall remember Tom
Mann's remark the day the decision was made to go ahead on Cuba:
"I would never have favored initiating this operation, but, olace it
kaz gone as far as it bae, I do not think we can rich cailing it off."

The result of CIA's initiative in covert political oporations bas boun
to cranto situations which have forced policy on the State Department.
This was not the original idea behind CIA. As Allen Dulles WTCCS
in hie 1947 memorandum to the Sonats Arund Services Committes,
"The Central Intelligence Agency should have anthing to do with policy."
Yot, in the years since, CIA has, in effect, 'made' pelloy in many
parte of the world. A number of governments still in power know
that they have evan bzen targets of CIA attempts a worthrax --
a state of mind calculated to stimuleta friendly feelings toward the
United States. Indonesia, of course, ia a prime example.
This experience suggests that the present system by which CIA notifies
State of a projected covert operatica is inadequate to protect US
bntoroute,
There must be some means by which Skote can be informed
ef such operations at an carly enough otaga to affect the conception
and preliminary planning of the operation. Chhorviss CLA will coa-

foreign policy but at too late a point to subject that impact to reason-
