Dear Mr. Price:
GITY MANAGERS

This is a retyped letter. I visited Mr. Ferry , Deputy District
Attorney, on August 16, 1977. I told in the office that F.B.I. agents and
Secret Service use police department to harass me. Police department do
supply pencil of anesthesia gas to the manager of the building I live. The
manager door use certain people, to freeze me by anesthesia gas - then push
drugs, poison in my mouth to torture me to take my sleep away - or bleed
by rectal and they use many other chemicals to brainwash me to use me in
political assassination which I refused. On January 20, 1976 in Sacramento on
8th and I Streets, man came to me from police or post office, U.S. Department
of Justice and freeze me by gas and told me to take gun, pistol and we will
tell you where to go to shoot - to kill - Mr. Sargent Shriver. I refused.
Manager, Mr. Sisel, of Marshall Hotel, call on the man to tell me this on
the street. In February 1976, police intelligence told me that assassination
will not happen here. How about to move to Maryland state.
-
In this letter I ask you to get report from Dr. Frederick S. Baker, M.D.
colon and rectal surgery on January 31, 1978. His phone - 452-4095. I do
bleed today very much and I am weak, In this letter I ask you to give re-
strain order or respond to me what could be done. The right wing in America
made record to use me in assassination. I refuse. I am human and I like to
be treated as human. Police put frame up on me - just to take advantages on
me. Police use lie, police use mental case to take advantages on me and teli
me that right wing do use such people like me. To prove I enclose copy mid-
night June 14, 1976. Also I enclose copy letter I sent. to Mr. Ted Sheedy,
Supervisor, on January 26, 1978 and copy of his reply to me.
Please respond to me.
Thank you.

To Russian Ambassador
Embassy of U.S.S.R.
1125 16th Street
Washington, D. C.
Dear Sir:
This is retyped letter from hand written
Mr. Wasilev Consul gave me order to transmit this information to U. S. Government,
on August 9, 1963 in Sofia, Bulgaria. Mr. Wasilev, Consul of Embassy of U.S.S.R.,
gave me this information about Mr. Lee Harvey Oswald on August 14, 1963. Mrs.
Besera Asenova, girl friend of Russian Consul came to my room and repeated that
Mr. Lee Harvey Oswald is assassin. He will kill President Kennedy.
On August 15, 1963 in Sofia, Bulgaria, at the airport in embassy car, I told to
Mr. Blackshire, American Vice Consul, that Mr. Lee Harvey Oswald is assissin.
He has a weapon or has ordered one. Mr. Blackshire said it seems like he will
kill someone. I said that Mr. Lee H. Oswald is preparing to kill President
of the United States, John F. Kennedy. Mr. Blackshire said where will it happen.
I said they (right wing) will invite President, criticize him in the newspaper,
then kill him. Mr. Blackshire told me he will give the telegram to Department
of State and he gave me the address where to report.
At 9 a.m. on August 19, 1963 in Washington, D. C., I went to see (Mr. Kippingan)
Director of Special Counselor Service Department of State at 1901 Pennsylvania
Avenue-11th floor. I told the Director that I have information about President
Kennedy. The Director said do not mention name of President Kennedy, only
respond to the questions. The Director said tell us what will happen to Mr.
Lee Harvey Oswald then. I said Mr. Lee H. Oswald will be killed after kill
Kennedy. I said I will take the truth drug to tell the truth. Director tell
us who else get killed in this country. I said as I heard, that Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. will be killed. Who will kill Dr. King, Jr. Negro leader?
I said a man who is in prison at this time. (Mr. James Earl Ray was in prison
at that time.) Director asked where assassination will happen. I said in Dallas,
Texas. Director said if someone gave this information here I would expel the
man. Director did call on F.B.I. agents after F.B.I. use anesthesia gas to
freeze me to drub me to keep amnesia.
I told Director Department of State that Mr. Lee Harvey Oswald have a weapon.
Go see him. Director told me you too can have weapon--so what if Oswald got
weapon.
Sincerely,
U.S House of Representatives
