SOURCE US citizen, executive of an import/export company with extensive business
connections in Central America and the Caribbean. Ee makes frequent trips
to these areas, and has contact with high ranking military and political
leaders. He speaks Spanish fluently.
1. The Government of Honduras (GOH) recently obtained a US$12 zillion loan
from the Central American Bank of Economic Integration for the expansion
of the Azucarera del Sur sugar mill located in Choluteca, Honduras. In
addition, the GOH has purchased two sugar mills, one in Brazil and the
other in Puerto Rico. The mills, bought at a cost of US$15 million each,
will be dismantled and shipped to caduras, where they will be reassembled
with the aid of foreign technicians. Also, another sugar nill is to be
built in the country at a cost of US$20 million; however, the Japanese
Mitsubishi enterprise will be the major stockholder, while Honduran private
businessmen will hold a minority interest. This is part of an expansion
and modernization program by the GOH with hopes of obtaining a larger
share of the world's sugar market.
2. The GCE is somewhat concerned with the infiltration through Mexico and
Guatemala of Communist agitators and guerrilla training personnel. These
guerrillas, mostly Cubans who remained in the country after they had
arrived allegedly to assist the GOH following Hurricane Fifi, are causing
growing concern as a result of several uprisings and invasion of private
lands by peasants in several parts of the country. The Cubans, who stayed
In the country following Hurricane Fifi and others who have arrived
clandestinely since that time, reportedly are training leftist militants
and sympathizers among the Honduran peasants. The agitators and guerrilla
instructors are taking advantage of growing unemployment and the overall
poor national economic situation to stir the peasants into activity against
the government.

US citizen, executive of an import/export company with extensive business
connections in Central America and the Caribbean. Ee makes important trips
to these areas and has contact with high ranking military and political
leaders. He speaks Spanish fluently.
1. The new military regime in Honduras currently is holding talks with
Venezuela and hopes to sign an economic agreement in the very near
future. With that mind, the Goverment of Honduras (GOH) recently
sent a high level commission to Venezuela headed by Captain Armando
San Martin, Secretary of State for Economy and Commerce and by Attorney
Antonio Jose Cuello to ivid discussions with high ranking Venezuelan
Government officials. Prior to the talks, the GOH recently sold to
Venezuela 25 million linear feet of lumber at a total cost of US$5
million. The GOH hopes to reach an agreement by which Venezuela would
buy Honduran agricultural products for an unspecified mix of cash and
petroleum products. In addition, Venezuela would support a new agri-
cultural production plan to be implemented in the very near future by
Fernando Montes, Honduran Secretary of State for Agriculture.
2. Despite reports that Chief Executive Colonel Juan Alberto Melgar Castro
has unquestioned authority, Honduran military sources have indicated
that Mario Maldonado, Agrarian Refora Chief; Lieutenant Colonel Mario
Fonseca, Director of the Military Academy, and Lieutenant Colonel Juan
Ramon Molina Cisneros, Commander of the First Artillery Battalion are
the real "power behind the throne." These officers, who profess a
strong nationalist ideology, are interested simply in the general welfare
of the Honduran people, and they are maintaining a "watchdog" attitude
to insure that no one, especially people in positions of power, uses
such positions for his own personal benefit. These officers are members
of the National Defense Council (NDC), which also includes the commanders
of all major military units in the country. Maldonado, Fonseca, and
Molina appear to be the "first among equals" in the 15 member NDC.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION
Naturalized US citizen who has worked and lived in Honduras for a number
of years. He has numerous social contacts and business connections with
officials of the government, the Armed Forces and the business community.
[This report was developed by an Arcy representative assigned to the
office of preparation.]
1. Horacio Moya Posas is the present director of Agrarian Reform in Honduras.
He is inefficient and lacks some of the necessary qualifications for that
position. In spite of him being a lawyer by profession, he is not astute,
is only of average intelligence, is far from decisive, and frequently
vacillates when called upon to make decisions. Be is, however, extremely
anti-Communist. His deputy director is Roberto Oliva. He is no asset.
He has no outgoing personality whatsoever, and in fact, he is rather
innocuous. One thing that can be said in his favor is that he is reported
to be a good engineer.
2. The previoss Agrarian Reform director was Rigoberto Sandoval. He is an
extremely capable lawyer, very sagacious, intelligent and he displayed
great foresight in that position. His present and future course of life
is worth observing closely because a possibility does exist that he say
be a candidate for an important political position in the not too distant
future. To date Sandoval has not mentioned which political position he
plans to seek. Another reason for observing his is that he is exceedingly
anti-US.

Early in October 1972 a US importer-exporter received a very pleasant
personal letter from Rigoberto Sandoval. By the tone of the letter one
would judge that a close relationship has existed between them for some
time. Sandoval stated that he was in Italy working for the Food and Agri-
culture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and that for the present
his stay there was for an indefinite period. He enclosed a long list of
items which he requested the US importer-exporter to send to him inmediately
if at all possible. The list consisted mostly of furniture, household
furnishings, electrical appliances, etc.
