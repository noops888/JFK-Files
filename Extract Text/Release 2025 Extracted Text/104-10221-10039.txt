14 June 1976
SUBJECT: LORENZ, Liona Marita
1. As the result of an article on Subject in the 13 June 1976
New York Daily News, LVG was asked to do a file check to determine
whether Subject was ever connected with the Agency. According to
EA/COG Desk check, IP trace, CI/OA and Security Office check, Z
has never been employed by the Agency. Of interest, however, is the
fact that her sister, Val eric LORENZ, was granted a CSC on 14 July
1955, initiated by Finance Division, as a witting employee. At
that time Valerie was an employee of the National Pank of Washington.
2. There are several references, sourced to the FBI and IXCD
LORENZ is a self-admitted former girl friend of Fidel CASTRO. Sk
claims that she met Fidel while on a trip to Cuba with her father,
Captain of the North German Lloyd Line, in February 1959, became
infatuated with Fidel and stayed in Cuba. She served as Fidel's
mistress and came to the U.S. with Fidel's party in April 1959. She
learned at that time that she was pregnant by him. Marita returned
to Havana a short time thereafter and hadia miscarriage, She claims
that she was drugged and taken to a hospital where an abortion was
performed, Because of Fidel's reaction to the pregnancy, she turned
against him. LORENZ returned to the U.S. from Cuba on 9 December 1959.
Because of the bad abortion operation performed on LORENZ in Cuba
in September 1959, LORENZ was-operated-on-by a Dr. Hanniar on 20-
January 1960 at the Roosevelt Hospital in New York City.
14-00000
It is said that LORENZ appeared on the Today's Show on 14
June 1976. She reportedly made the statement that she was associated
with Frank STURGIS, and that she had placed some poison pills in
her face cream for the purpose of assassinating Fidel. A 24 April
1961 FBI document states that on 8 January 1961 LORENZ, STURGIS, Alex
ROHKE wero to meet that evening and attempt a unity meeting of
anti-Castro Cubans. The unity meeting was sponsored by Luis CONTE
Aguero, one of the leading anti-Castro Qubans. I have uncovered nothing
to date concerning an assassination attempt (in this connection.)

: CIR-316/01746-77
According to a source of the Miami Field Office
of the Domestic Collection Division, Subject disclosed
to the source the following information concerning plans
which allegedly reflect Subject's interest in Africa and
Panama in conversations held on or around 5 June 1977.
Subject has discussed plans to establish a Cuban Govern-
ment in exile on Angolan soil with the help of Holden
ROBERTO, FNLA. Subject is prepared on receipt of agree
ment from Roberto to provide food, medical teams and
other forms of assistance to the FNLA. Ostensibly, this
would be a first step following recognition by Roberto
of a Cuban Exile Government. 'This government would then
attempt to raise troops and, among other things, capture as
many Castro soldiers as possible in order to use them as
an exchange or trade instrument. The funds for such an
enterprise ostensibly would come from Cuban Communities in
Brazil, Nicaragua, Panama, Mexico, Venezuela and the United
States. One aspect of the proposed unconventional war i
the use of counterfeit Angolan money. Also allegedly
involved is planning to secure Angolan aid for Panamanians
who oppose Torrijos.
2. Involved in unspecified ways in these plans are
the following:
