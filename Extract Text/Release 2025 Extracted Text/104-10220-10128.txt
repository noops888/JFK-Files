COMMENTS RE DEROGATORY TRACES
ATTACHMENT TO FORM 772
SECRET
1. A POA was requested on Subject in January 1968 for his
use as a penetration of Venezuelan General Directorate of
Police. Cancellation was requested in February 1968 because
of indications that Subject was involved in "clandestine sabotage
activity and suspicions that Subject failed to report his activi-
ties to CIA. Thereafter, Subject was treated as a "hostile".
In the ensuing months Subject was described as "an extremely
valuable penetration" because of his important and accurate
intelligence information and operational reports. Subject was
given a polygraph examination to clear up questions about pos-
sible affiliation with Cuban intelligence, unreported associa-
tion with gangster elements, etc. His responses showed no
information which would provent CIA using him for ops purposes.
Request for POA was again roquested on 7 September 1968. This
POA request was turned down on 15 October due to Subject being
an "agent of a foreign power."
2. Since that time Subject has continued to provide verbal
and written information reports concerning Communist and subver-
sive elements, guerrilla activities, Soviet activities, sabotage,
etc. Subject continues to report accurately and often and has
a very pro-U.S. attitudo. Subject was again polygraphed on
29 November 1971 (a copy of which is contained in Subject's
CI/OA folder). His responses indicated no deception concern-
ing truthfulness of reporting to CIA, no compromise of his
U.S. Government connections, non-involvement in illegal arms
dealings, etc.
