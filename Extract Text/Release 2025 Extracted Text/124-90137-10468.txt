CONTINUANCE OF NOTE:
The has made available copies of incoming and outgoing
manifests of Cubana flights between New York and Havana.
New York has pointed out that PSI has not furnished data
of unusual value; but because of his position, has a good
potential. CIA advised Liaison Agent Papich it would not
contactPSuntil it had received authority to do so from
Bureau. Before allowing CIA to make contact with PSI, it (C)
is believed it would be best for our interests to determine
if PSI can can actually assist CIA. If he is in position to
assist that Agency, we will then consider what stand to
take in this matter.
