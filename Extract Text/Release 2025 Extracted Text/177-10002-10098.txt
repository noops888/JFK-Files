1. Cuba
a. Cuban tents are now beginning to appear at a number of the
SAM sites--further evidence that
training of Cubans in operation of
SAM equipment has begun as scheduled.
b. High-altitude photography
taken this past weekend shows these
tents at six SAM sites in western
Cuba. These sites are in addition
to those at which we noted the presence of Cuban interpreters as we
reported on Saturday.
c. This training should be completed by next May or June.
d. Just before the training
started, we noted a series of moves
involving the relocation of eight of
the SAM sites.
e. The purpose, it appears,
was to shift the mission of the system from an area defense of the
island as a whole to point defense
of specific targets, particularly
Havana, (Includes INTERCEPTS)
2. Syria-Iraq
a. Syrian leaders have acceded
to pressure from Iraq and have expelled Iraqi Baathist extremist Ali
Saadi. He has gone to Athens

b. This is an earnest of the
desire of moderate Baathist leaders
in Damascus to preserve workable relations with Iraq, partly as a
counterbalance to Cairo and partly
to preserve what remains of Baathist
influence in Baghdad.
c. Intercepts show at least
some Syrian troops will remain in
Iraq at the request of Iraqi officials.
d. Preparations had been under
way for these forces to withdraw;
retention of at least some in Iraq
is another sign that both regimes
hope to preserve something of the
relations they once had.

a. Prime Minister Inonu's
coalition government is about to
collapse.
b. It has long been shaky.
Last week it was dealt a severe setback when the opposition Justice
Party, heir of the Menderes regime,
emerged from local elections as the
country's majority party.

c. Now the Peasant Party, one
of the three in the coalition, has
voted to pull out, and probably will
do so as soon as Inonu gets back from
Washington. Another partner, the
Turkey Party, has wanted to pull out,
and apparently has stayed in only
because of pressure from the military.
d. A new coalition is at least
a theoretical possibility, with a
number of independents taking the
place of the Peasant Party, but
Inonu probably would not be prime
minister.
e. The military are working
for an all-party coalition. This
way, they feel, they could keep
tabs on the Justice Party, but the
Justice Party is not likely to buy
this arrangement.
f. As matters now stand, the
military would take over the government itself before it would let the
Justice Party form one.
a. Soviet President Brezhnev
has told the Iranian prime minister
that the decision to buy wheat abroad
was taken to avoid lowering reserves,
which he has described as ample for
one or two years. We think the situation is more serious than that.
(Cont'd)

b. This year's harvest was
clearly very bad. The weight of
evidence suggests that Soviet grain
stockpiles have been far drawn down
this year and are not sufficient to
protect the country from another
poor harvest.
c. Our estimate is that total
grain production each year since
1958 has been well below that year's
level of 125 million tons, while
the population has continued to grow.
d. We have seen from intercepts
signs of extensive slaughtering in
anticipation of fodder shortages
during the winter. This runs counter
to Khrushchev's oft-stated plan to
build up the livestock industry.
e. We have also noted that
the extensive wheat purchases weaken
the USSR's gold reserves at a time
when it hopes to expand its imports
of machinery for a huge chemical
fertilizer program.
f. In addition, we have seen
signs of stringent measures to protect the grain supply, accompanied
by public discontent in some areas
over the absence of bread.

5. Communist
China
Argentina
a. Peiping last week contracted for some 300,000 tons of
wheat (cost about $20,000,000) from
Argentina.
b. This adds to the 1,000,000
tons just contracted for with Australia, but is still far below
the 5,000,000 tons the Chinese have
normally imported in recent years.
Additional suppliers will be hard
to find.
c. A large sale, apparently
involving some $56,000,000 worth
of meat, is apparently also being
arranged. This is interesting,
not only for the sizeable foreign
exchange outlay, but also for the
concern it shows for improving the
diet of the mainland's urban population.
d. The same caloric value
could be obtained from grains at
a fraction of this cost.
(INTERCEPTS throughout)

6. Czechoslovakia-
USSR
a. Czech President and party
boss Novotny has gone to Moscow,
evidently for economic talks, judging by the composition of his delegation.
b. Novotny's background of
Stalinist excesses have put him on
the wrong side of Khrushchev. They
also have given rise to control
problems, particularly in the fractious Slovak party where pressures
for liberalization have made their
mark.
c. Party problems and Novotny's
leadership may thus also come under
review.
d. A curious sign of the times
is the fact that, although President
Novotny is in Moscow, the presidential
flag has remained up at the official
residence. It might simply have been
an oversight, but the symbolism will
not be lost to the people in Prague.
7. Cambodia
a. Cambodia, as expected, has
asked the Geneva co-chairman to call
the Geneva conference participants
together (in Djakarta) to discuss
measures "to ensure the internationally guaranteed and controlled neutralization of Cambodia.".

8. Egypt-Yemen
b. Last year when this came
up, the French were inclined to go
along with some such idea.
c. They have indicated to us
that they still feel Sihanouk should
not be turned down, and Sihanouk is
obviously hopeful that they will
exert pressure on us and the British.
d. Sihanouk seems to be hoping
for at least a rump session attended
by conferees who are willing to do
his bidding.
a. An Egyptian military message reporting to Cairo on operations
in Yemen this past weekend indicated
that poison gas (referred to as
"ghurab" in Egyptian military traffic) was used against royalist tribes-
men in the northwest.
b. This is the first time we
have noted its employment since
last summer, although another intercept shows that the Egyptian command has continued to authorize its
use.

c. It is basically a tear gas,
but in such highly concentrated form
that it has caused the death of a number of Yemenis.
(INTERCEPTS throughout)
a. Opposition leftist Congolese exiles, operating from Brazzaville across the river, are reported
to be plotting to assassinate Congolese Premier Adoula and some of his
ministers.
b. It is supposed to happen
sometime after 8 December.
c. Meanwhile, agents are being
infiltrated with money to buy off
opposition to a takeover immediately
thereafter by radical nationalist
Gbenye.
d. Adoula's government already
knows that this group of left-wing
subversives, which now numbers about
50, is being helped by the Communist
bloc.
e. It operates fairly freely
in the loose circumstances which now
obtain in Brazzaville. Its activities
may soon become a serious source of
friction between the two countries.

NOTES
A. South Korea With 85 percent of the vote in, Pak
Chong-hui's Democratic Republican Party has already
won an absolute majority in the National Assembly
elections held yesterday.
B. Venezuela The country's three major presidential
candidates were the targets of unsuccessful assassination attempts yesterday as Communist-led terrorists moved into the final week of desperate attempt
to wreck next Sunday's elections. A US Embassy official was also the intended recipient of a "Christmas package" containing a bomb. Yesterday a US
rubber warehouse was set afire and destroyed by
terrorists.
C. Indonesia-Philippines We have what is about as
sure a sign as we can get that Sukarno will be going to Manila as reported yesterday. A reliable
source tells us Sukarno has sent advance word to
two of his favorite Philippine girl friends that he
will be arriving on 28 November.
D. Indonesia-Malaysia Indonesian-inspired press reports yesterday claimed a British military plane
was shot down near the North Borneo border. British
Intelligence tells us the story is concocted; no
aircraft are reported missing.
E. Cuba The alert in the Cuban military which we
noted immediately after President Kennedy's death
has been lifted.

F. Cambodia Cambodia is cutting its diplomatic representation abroad to a bare minimum as an austerity
measure following curtailment of US aid, Sihanouk
announced last week that this would be done, saying
that missions in Communist countries would not be
affected since those countries "protect" Cambodia.
Curiously enough, among the missions being closed
down are those in New Delhi and Rangoon. (Includes
