Proposal for a Multi-Agency Declassification Review of Joseph Califano's Army
Papers under the JFK Act
Gentlemen:
The Assassination Records Review Board would like to make arrangements with you to
declassify six boxes of Army records from the files of Joseph Califano. The files date
principally from the period 1962-63, during which Mr. Califano served as Army General
Counsel and as Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Army. The records had been
deposited at the National Archives and Records Administration, where they were
recently located. A description of the records, which primarily pertain to U.S. activities
related to Cuba, is attached hereto. We have identified what appears to us to be
equities of numerous military entities in the Califano papers as well as equities of the
Central Intelligence Agency, the State Department, the United States Information
Agency, and others.
Deadlines
Due to the volume of the records, and the Review Board's current sunset date of
September 30, 1997, it is important that we proceed expeditiously in our review of the
records. We have slated the Califano papers for review by the Board at its August 5-6, 1997
meeting. The Review Board staff is prepared to assist you in making arrangements for a
prompt and efficient review of the Califano papers.
The Review Board is seeking from Congress a one-year, one-time extension to
September 30, 1998. Congressman Dan Burton is sponsoring a bill to extend the life of
the Review Board. Should the Review Board receive the proposed extension, we may
be able to revisit the schedule proposed below.

Preliminary Review of Califano Papers
The Review Board staff has conducted an initial review of the records and has
tentatively reached the following conclusions: first, the records are very similar in
subject manner to many other records that already are a part of the JFK Collection;
second, although the vast majority of the records technically remain classified, there is
little remaining sensitivity due to the passage of time and to the release of much of the
information in other contexts; and third, the Califano papers contain equities of
numerous military and non-military agencies, which, under the standard referral
process, would be very difficult and time-consuming. Thus, the logistical problem in
declassifying the records is not the continued sensitivity of the records, but the number
of agencies that will need to review their own equities in the records. For this reason,
and for the short time-line on which we are now operating, we believe that there is an
urgent need to make acceptable arrangements for the review and referral of records.
Proposal
In order to expedite the process and make it more efficient, we would like to propose an
alternate arrangement for declassification of records that we previously have found
effective. We suggest the holding of a multi-agency concurrent review of the Califano
papers. We would like to schedule a single session at our offices, on or before July 23,
1997, where all agencies with equities in the Califano papers be concurrently present for
a declassification review. At such a session, agencies would be able to review their own
equities in the records, declassify them, and simply hand them across the table to other
agencies for their review. It has been our own experience that sessions of this sort
greatly simply the review process by giving agencies the opportunity to speak with
each other and quickly to resolve questions.
Because the Califano papers will need to be reviewed by the Board at its August 5-6
meeting, we believe that an arrangement such as is proposed above will provide all
agencies with a full opportunity to identify their equities in the records and to make
determinations regarding the need for continued classification. If the Army and the
Ms. Toni Bowie, of the Army Declassification Activity, spent three days
reviewing some of the records and making recommendations for referrals to other
agencies both within and outside of the military. Although Ms. Bowie worked
energetically for three days, it was our sense afterwards that, if we continue at the same
pace, the agencies with equities will likely not be able to complete their reviews before
the August deadline arrives.

Department of Defense are agreeable to such an arrangement, the Review Board will
take the responsibility for contacting all non-military agencies with equities in the
records while Army and DoD make arrangements for all appropriate military entities to
be present.
We are, of course, very willing to consider other ideas or suggestions that you might
have. However, because the clock is ticking, it is important that we promptly develop a
plan that will provide all agencies with equities in the Califano papers to have an
opportunity to review and declassify their equities.
I look forward to discussing this issue with you.
Sincerely,
T. Jerenay Gunn

JOSEPH CALIFANO PAPERS (6 boxes)
Identified by Steve Tilley at NARA, these 6 boxes of papers, almost exclusively from
1962-63, were either generated by, or addressed to Joseph Califano, who at this time
was Department of the Army General Counsel and Special Assistant to the Secretary of
the Army. Most of the documents are short summaries of proposed policy positions, or
letters of transmittal, with voluminous appendices attached. Each of the 6 boxes
contains approximately 1500-2000 pages of material.
Representative Topics:
(1) ICCCA (Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee of Cuban Affairs-the
"Cottrell Committee") meetings on future U.S. policy toward Cuba. These
documents are generally background papers prepared prior to meetings,
minutes of meetings, or follow-on discussion of action items assigned at
meetings of the ICCCA.
(2) Contingency plans for Cuban invasion by the U.S. military in the event of
a Cuban uprising.
(3) Psychological warfare against Cuba.
(4) Diplomatic initiatives intended to increase isolation of Cuba.
(5) Biographies, and evaluations of Cuban exile leaders.
(6) Intelligence reports and estimates on reported events inside Cuba.
(7) Summaries of clandestine paramilitary actions taken against Cuba, and
suggestions for possible future actions.
Apparent Equities:
Ninety-five per cent of the documents appear to have multiple-agency equities,
usually 4 to 6 agencies per document. Based upon staff review, it is estimated
that 80% of the documents have State equities, 60% Joint Staff or OSD, 60% NSC,
60% CIA, 15% Army, Navy or Air Force, perhaps 10% DIA, and a small
percentage of USIA, Justice, Treasury and FBI.

JOINT STAFF PAPERS (147 documents)
Using broad topic guidelines provided previously by ARRB staff, the Joint Staff at the
Pentagon has reviewed 40 boxes of records of Joint Chiefs Chairmen Lyman Lemnitzer,
Maxwell Taylor, and Earle Wheeler for 1961-1964, as well as JCS central files for 1962
and 1963, and has flagged 147 documents which will enhance the historical
understanding of the Kennedy administration, and which some scholars will believe
may be relevant to the assassination.
Topics:
(1) ICCCA (Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee of Cuban Affairs)
meetings regarding future U.S. policy toward Cuba.
(2) Special Group (5412 committee) meetings and decisions; and covert
paramilitary operations against Cuba.
(3) Cuban coup planning.
(4) Vietnam coup planning, and discussion of Diem and Nhu.
(5) OPLAN 34A (covert actions against North Vietnam).
(6) U.S. military strength levels in Vietnam.
Apparent Equities:
Multiple agency equities appear to apply to virtually every document-usually
State, OSD and/or NSC. The Joint Staff has stated in writing that it is prepared
to expeditiously process these documents for declassification in collaboration
with agencies which have equities, and then accession the declassified
documents to NARA. Currently the Joint Staff is awaiting guidance from ARRB
staff on which of the tabbed folders we desire to have placed in the collection;
upon receipt of that guidance, they will commence declassification review.

Re: Proposal for a Multi-Agency Declassification Review of Selected Papers of JCS
Chairmen Lemnitzer, Taylor and Wheeler, and Selected JCS Central Files
under the IFK Act
Gentlemen:
The Assassination Records Review Board would like to make arrangements with you to
declassify approximately 147 records previously flagged by the Joint Staff from both the
JCS Central Files, and the papers of JCS Chairmen Lemnitzer, Taylor and Wheeler. The
files date principally from the period 1961-64. The records were flagged during
searches directed by Mr. Edmund McBride (Chief, Information Management Division,
Joint Staff) at the request of the ARRB staff. With one exception, ARRB staff feels that
all records flagged by Mr. McBride's working group are relevant to the historical
understanding or context of the assassination of President Kennedy. A description of
the records, which primarily pertain to U.S. activities related to Cuba, or to Vietnam
policy, is attached hereto. We have identified what appear to us to be equities of
numerous military entities in these papers, as well as equities of the Central Intelligence
Agency, the State Department, the National Security Council, and others.
Deadlines
Due to the volume of the records, and the Review Board's current sunset date of
September 30, 1997, it is important that we proceed expeditiously in our review of the
records. We have slated these papers for review by the Board at its August 5-6, 1997 meeting.

The Joint Staff's Initial Statement of Compliance to the Review Board, dated
February 6, 1997, identified in detail the process by which these records were located-
namely, which files were searched, and who participated in the searches. Mr. Edmund
McBride, Chief of the Joint Staff Information Management Division, indicated in this
statement that the Joint Staff was standing by to expeditiously process these records for
declassification in collaboration with other agencies when the ARRB was ready. ARRB
staff has only recently completed its initial review of these records, which constitute
selectively flagged folders within 40 boxes of JCS and Joint Staff records.

Invitation to Next Declassification Session for Califano Papers and JCS
Records
1. I am writing to notify you that the next working session for joint declassification
review of subject records in accordance with the standards of the JFK Act is scheduled
for Tuesday, October 7 through Thursday, October 9, inclusive, in the ARRB conference
room in our second floor offices at 600 E Street, N.W.
2. Our goals for this second session are to complete joint review of the JCS papers, and
to open up for review two more boxes in the Califano collection. This session will also
allow selected agencies (which were not able to complete review of documents available
at the first session) an opportunity to catch up.
3. We see a need for representatives of the CIA to continue to attend these sessions
until they are completed.
4. Names and clearances need to be faxed to us only if the CIA attendees for this
October session are different from those clearances passed to ARRB in July. Our point-
of-contact and fax number for clearances is Tracy Shycoff, at (202) 724-0457.
5. For planning purposes, following this October session, our plans are to host one
session per month, of 2 to 3 days duration each time, until the declassification review of
the selected JCS papers and the Califano collection is completed. Agencies which
require more time are welcome to make individual appointments to review these
documents in-between the monthly, group sessions.

IFK ASSASSINATION RECORDS REVIEW BOARD RELEASES MILITARY
RECORDS RELATED TO U.S. POLICY TOWARD CUBA FROM 1962-64
The Assassination Records Review Board, an independent federal agency overseeing
the identification, review, and release of records related to the assassination of President
John F. Kennedy, today released approximately 1,500 pages of previously classified
military records from 1962-64 that relate to U.S. policy toward Cuba.
"These documents further expand the historical record by illustrating the United States
government's deep interest in developing a policy that would force Castro from power
during the early 1960's," said Dr. Anna Nelson, a member of the Review Board. "We
now have a new window into the policy options toward Cuba that were being
considered and debated at the highest levels of the military services."
The mandate of the Review Board is to make the record surrounding the assassination
of President Kennedy as complete as possible. The Board has aggressively sought to
uncover records on U.S. foreign policy that put the assassination into its historical
context.
The Review Board worked cooperatively with representatives from the Department of
Defense (DOD) and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) to
locate records stored at NARA that met the definition of being "assassination related."
The documents are from the files of Joseph Califano, who served as General Counsel to
the Secretary of the Army, the files of Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairmen Lemnitzer, Taylor
and Wheeler, and the central files of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
The records have been transferred to NARA for inclusion in the JFK Collection, which is
housed at the NARA facility in College Park, Maryland. These documents are now
available to researchers.
Copies of selected documents are available from the Assassination Records Review
Board, 600 E Street, NW, Second Floor, Washington, DC 20530; telephone number: (202)

The Assassination Records Review Board was established by the JFK Act, which was
signed into law by President George Bush. The five members of the Board were
appointed by President Clinton, confirmed by the U.S. Senate, and sworn in on April
11, 1994. The law gives the Review Board the mandate and the authority to identify,
secure, and make available all records related to the assassination of President
Kennedy. It is the responsibility of the Board to determine which records are to be
made public immediately and which ones will have postponed release dates.
The Review Board consists of the following members:
Honorable John R. Tunheim, Chair; U.S. District Court Judge, District of Minnesota.
Dr. Henry F. Graff; Professor Emeritus of History at Columbia University.
Dr. Kermit L. Hall; Dean, College of Humanities, and Professor of History at The Ohio

POSSIBLE ACTIONS TO PROVOKE, HARRASS, OR DISRUPT
--CUBA-
1. Operation SMASHER:
a. Objective: The objective is to disrupt/disable military and
commercial communications facilities in Cuba.
b. Concept: This to be accomplished by the clandestine introduction of
a "special" vacuum tube into selected communications equipment. The tube,
which is available, is virtually undetectable inasmuch as its effectiveness is
due to the insertion of a chemical compound in the base of the tube. The
chemical, when heated becomes a conductor, when cool a non-conductor.
2. Operation FREE RIDE:
a. Objective: The objective is to create unrest and dissension amongst
the Cuban people.
b. Concept: This to be accomplished by airdropping valid Pan American
or KLM one-way airline tickets good for passage to Mexico City, Caracas,
etc. (none to the U.S.). Tickets could be intermixed with other leaflets

4. Operation DEFECTOR:
a. Objective: To induce elements or individuals of the Cuban military to
defect with equipment.
