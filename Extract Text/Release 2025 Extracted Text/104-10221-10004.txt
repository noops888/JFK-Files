Attached for both addressess are copies of a brief biographie sketch
on Victor RICO Gelan. As can be seen fras the sketch, Headquartero knows
something of his activities, but next to nothing about the man himself.
During the discussion of the problem of RICO Galan at the resent CP Oper
ations Seminar in Hoxico City it was montioned that both LICOOKY-1 and
LIYANIL-9 ware personally acquainted with hing perhaps these two sources
could provide some impressions of RICO Calan that would flesh out this
skeleton sketch.

VICTOR RICO GALAN (201-336474)
1. DPORI 6 February 1928; El Ferrol, Spain. Subject, Spanish by birth,
bocame a Mexican citisen by naturalization on 15 March 1949.
2. CIVIL STATUS: Subject is married to Ingeborg DIENER do Rico.
3. ADDRESS: Providencia 930, Mexico City, D. F. Telephone number as of
September 19648 23 07 92. This phone is registered in the name of his
mother-in-law, Tilli PICHIER viuda de Diener, whose address is also
Providencia 930.
4. OCCUPATION: Writer for Siempre and Politica magazines in Mexico City;
both are effective Comminist-ining magazines and have large cireulation.
5. PHOTOGRAPH: Available in Subject's 201 file (date of photograph Ostober
1963).
6. POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS AND INCLINATIONS: As of 1962 Subject was the head
of the liational Press and Propaganda Committee of the National Liberation
Movenont (MLN) in Mexico City, a rabidly anti-U.S. and pro-Castro organi
sation. Subject is close to Fidel Castro and company, and is ecnsidered
as a Cuban "agent" (degree of Caban control unknown). Bubject was a
founding member of the MLN. In an article in Siempre in Merch 1963 bo
advocated the foundation of a new political party reflecting the 16sology
of General Lazaro Cardenas, leftist former President of Maxies. This
would have provided, in his belter, the Mexican left a political organi
zation traly responsive to the radical tendencies of the 1910 revolution. This
was nsesosary because the MIN, whono membership covers the spectrum
of Hexican Communist Party to FRI, could not take open politisni standa
without antagonising some of the moabership. The new party would have
represented a "third position", sccialisa in internal affairs and inde-
pondence of any blos is international affairs. With a party such as this
an ite political action arm, the MLN would have developed naturally into
a broad national movement such as the FRAP in Chile. (Some spericus
reasoning here.)

Ingeborg Diener de RICO Galan, Subject's wife, traveled from Mexico to
Cuba in November 1962. Subject was at that time in Cuba.
8. PASSPORT: Subject formerly carried Mexican passport number 57115, with
Cuban courtesy visas. On 9 September 1963 Subject was issued Mexican
passport muaber 56341 (er 53641).
9. ACTIVITIES: The reason for the October 1962 trip to Cuba was ostensibly
to gather material for a political biography of Fidel Castro. The May/
Juna 1963 trip was to interview Fidel Castro after his return from the
Soviet Union. Subject claimed that he had spent eight deys with Fidel
during that visit, five of those aboard ship.
On 24 October 1963 HYSAGE-1 in Panama City reported that Subjeet had
received an operational sssigiment from Castro (during the May/June 1963
visit to Habana) on which to travel through Contral and South America.
His mission was to persuade loftist parties to izmediately begin acts of
sabotage and violence, and to try to maintain these in order to take
pressure off Venezuela. Subject was also instructed to bring about better
unity among competing leftist factions to ensure greater impact for their
work. Subject did, in fact, contact many Communist Party and leftist
leaders during his Central and South America travel during the period
October 1963 Jamary 196. Free the (fragmentary) reporting on Subject
frea October 1963 through January 1964 it appears that he did discuss the
question of leftist unity.
و
10. In October 1964 the Guatemalan authorities captured a number of tape
recordings from the guerrillas in operations subsequent to a guerrilla
attack on a garrison in Pansos, Alta Verapas. Included in those tapes
was one made by RICO Qalan for delivery to the guerrillas. It consists
mainly of an exhortation for unity (among the POT and the 13 November Group)
SECRET
-3-
and counsel against letting doctrine replace action. The tape clearly
reveals RICO to be at once a very intellectual leftist who also has his
fest planted quite firaly on the ground. His approach is pragantic, not
theoretical. The tert of the tape indicates that it was nade sometime
after February and before mid-October 1964.
11. There is little at hand to indicate what manner of man is RICO Galan.
His 201 file reflects facts but not impressions. He apparently is known
personally by LICOOKY-1 and LITAMIL-9 in Mexico City, and these two
sources should be queried.

5. PHOTOGRAPH: Available in Subject's 201 file (date of photograph October

6. POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS AND INCLINATIONS: As of 1962 Subject was the head
of the National Press and Propaganda Committee of the National Liberation
Movement (MLN) in Mexico City, a rabidly anti-U.S. and pro-Castro organi-
zation. Subject is close to Fidel Castro and company, and is considered
as a Cuban "agent" (degree of Cuban control unknown). Subject was a
founding member of the MLN. In an article in Siempre in March 1963 he
advocated the foundation of a new political party reflecting the ideology
of General Lazaro Cardenas, leftist former President of Mexico. This
would have provided, in his belief, the Mexican left a political organi-
zation truly responsive to the radical tendencies of the 1910 revolution. This
was necessary because the MLN, whose membership covers the spectrum
of Mexican Communist Party to FRI, could not take open political stands
without antagonizing some of the membership. The new party would have
represented a "third position", socialism in internal affairs and inde-
pendence of any bloc in international affairs. With a party such as this
as its political action arm, the MLN would have developed naturally into
a broad national movement such as the FRAP in Chile. (Some specious
reasoning here.)
