MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, GS-13 Evaluation Board
SUBJECT
: Recommendation for Promotion to GS-14
Charlotte Bustos-Videla
1. It is recommended that Charlotte Bustos-Videla be promoted
from GS-13 to GS-14,
2. The performance of this officer has been characterized for
many years by all of her supervisors as consistently strong to out-
standing. She has been able to establish herself as indispensable in-
each Headquarters Branch or Field Station assignment, usually
functioning as the backbone of the unit to which assigned. Since return
to Headquarters in September 1972 from her field assignment in Mexico,
her performance has been entirely congruent with the thrust of the
Field Station's enthusiasm over her ability, performance, attitude and
growth potential. She is currently chief of the Cuban and CA Section
of her branch, and has established once again her mastery over her
assigned duties. She is the kind of sound, dependable, yet
imaginative officer greatly appreciated by her supervisors. In
short, she is a true professional who performs beyond her grade level.
3. In regard to her potential, she has served in the Agency
since 1951, starting as a secretary/stenographer, and advancing
brilliantly with each new challenge offered. She achieved professional
status in 1953 and has spent the bulk of her time since then specializing
in Latin American affairs, demonstrating total flexibility in assignments,
a voracious appetite for work and a penchant for exceptionally precise
and thorough production. A review of her career to date can lead to the
conclusion that she has always risen successfully to each new
professional challenge, and is still far from reaching her maximum
capacities, While she has had little supervisory experience in the
field, her supervisor was of the option that she is a "natural leader".
This has been borne out in her performance in her current capacity
as a Branch Section Chief, in which she has demonstrated exemplary
supervisory ability. Notwithstanding her drive, aggressiveness and
professional aplomb, she is a popular co-worker, is receptive to guidance
and sensitive and responsive to the needs of her subordinates.

4. This employee has utilized her fluency in the Spanish language
to maximum advantage in her work. Formal testing recently confirmed
her high proficiency in that language. Coupled with a comprehensive
training record and her invaluable experiences over a twenty year
period, she has become particularly effective in Latin American
operations and operational support, demonstrating excellence in each
of several recognized specializations, including CI operations,
functional support, reports and requirements, area support and varied
covert action activities,
5. The officer's adaptability, high intelligence and mastery over
her trade was of inestimable value to Mexico City Station, and over a
five year period from 1967 to 1972, she functioned as the Station's
internal troubleshooter. Her duties included the maintenance of
watchlists, screening of travel documents, processing of raw
technical take, target analysis, reperts writing, operational support,
handling of outside contract agents, and special assignments as the
Chief of Station's Executive Assistant,
6. The employee is occasionally called upon by the Office of
Training to administer specialized training, and she was chosen
recently to attend the Mid-Career Course ending in December 1972.
Meanwhile, her absence from her new job is felt sorely by the
Branch, L is expected that her current assignment will last about
two years,
7. In summary, we have here an exceptional officer who has
been performing at the level of a GS-14 for some years; it is now
time to promote her to that grade commensurate with her performance
and which she so justly deserves.

Mrs. Charlotte Bustos-Videla
1. On the basis of the information presented below,
it is recommended that a Quality Step Increase be approved

continues performing her past functions in the Cuban section

3.

typical of her performance since she entered the Agency in
1951, It is fully expected that this level of performance
will be maintained,

Recommendation for Promotion to Grade GS-13
Charlotte Z. Bustos-Videla
1. The promotion of Charlotte Z. Bustos-Videla from GS-12 to
GS-13 is hereby recommended.
2. This exceptional officer has now been performing at a
senior level for several years and, while recognition through a
Quality Step Increase was granted her last year, her sustained
performance clearly exceeding the requirements of a GS-13 qualifies
her for a promotion at this time. Subject is one of the outstanding
women who have demonstrated their capacity for even further
advancement within the Agency and will probably continue to advance
in the future. The present recommendation is based on already
demonstrated ability to operate at a senior level.
3. Subject is 30 years old and has been in grade as a GS-12
for the past five and one-half years.

MEMORANDUM FOR: CSPS/A
SUBJECT:
Recommendation for Promotion of
Charlotte Bustos-Videla
1. The promotion recommendation to GS-13 of Mrs.
Charlotte Bustos-Videla is hereby submitted. Mrs. Bustos-
Videla entered the Agency in August 1951 as a GS-5 and
rapidly and deservedly rose to a GS-12 by 1959. She has
now been almost seven years in grade and has been recom-
mended for promotion to the CSPS/ by WH Division five
times previously.
2. This outstanding officer has continued to per-
form at the exceptional level which has by now become her
standard of performance. Her past four annual Fitness
Reports have each given her an overall rating of outstanding.
In this connection it is noteworthy that no two Fitness Re-
ports were written by the same rating officer. She con-
tinues to occupy a GS-13 officer slot and her performance
clearly continues to exceed the requirements for that
position. She is considered to be one of the outstanding
women who have demonstrated their capacity for further
advancement within the Agency.
3. Mrs. Bustos-Videla not only continues to bring
continuity to the Mexican Branch through her long experience
on Mexican affairs, but consistently contributes to the
smooth functioning of the Branch through her highly efficient
organizational capabilities. She has been called upon to
handle all manner of difficult desk problems, She invariably
responds quickly, cheerfully, and effectively. She has been
instrumental in on-the-job training of a number of officers,
both for desk assignments and in preparation for field assign-
ments. She has excellent rapport with innumerable persons in
other areas and staffs, thus adding to the efficiency and
speed with which she accomplishes her daily tasks. Her pro-
motion at this time is urged,

MEMORANDUM FOR: Charlotte A. Bustos-Videla
THROUGH
: Head of GS Career Service
SUBJECT
: Notification of Non-eligibility for Designation as a
Participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability System
1. As you may know, we are in the process of reviewing the employment
history and current career-field of all employees in the Agency to identify
those who are eligible for designation as a participant in the new CIA
Retirement and Disability System. In this process, the initial review of
each case is made by the individual's Career Service. If the Head of his
Career Service nominates him for participation in the System, this nomina-
tion is reviewed by the CIA Retirement Board which recommends final action
to me. However, if the Head of the Career Service advises that the employee
does not meet the basic requirements of IIR 20-50 for participation, I have
accepted this finding without further review by the CIA Retirement Board.
This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting this screening
process so that those employees who are eligible to participate in the Sys-
tem may be designated participants as soon as possible,
2. In your case, the Head of your Career Service has advised me that
you do not meet the requirements of HR 20-50 for designation as a partici-
pant and I have accordingly made the formal determination required by the
regulation that you are not eligible for designation. From a review of your
record it appears that the decision of your Career Service was based upon
the fact that you do not have sufficient time prior to completing 15 years
of service with the Agency in which you could complete a minimum of 60 months
of qualifying service as required by regulation. My determination that you
are not eligible at this time for designation in no way affects your current
status under the Civil Service Retirement System, nor does it preclude con-
sideration of your eligibility to participate in the CIA System if you should
meet the requirements for designation in the future.
3. Should you desire further information concerning the requirements
for designation as a participant in the CIA Retirement System, I suggest that
you read paragraph of HR 20-50 and paragraph 5 of the employee Bulletin
dated 30 July 1965, entitled "Public Law 88-643, The Central Intelligence
Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees."
4. It is always possible that the records upon which the determination
made in your case may have been incomplete or inaccurate regarding your actual
