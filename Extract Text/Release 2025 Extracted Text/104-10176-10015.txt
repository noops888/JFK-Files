Information concerning the above firms and regarding Richard & illiam
Nolan CailLD and cortimer Claggett Clai, Jr. will be furnished
separately.
5. The activities and contacts of George PERISTERUPCULis
aka PERIS in Japan and Kures are currently being investigated by this
Agency.
6. George S. PERSIEROFCULUS aka Pials, identified above,
and known to William H. MARTIN as "George PARIS, is identical
with the individual whom Velestia HAHN aka Valentia Vasiliyevich
KHAN aka boasia HAN, admitted former (1947) Soviet agent, idonti-
fled as "George PARIS, & Greek businessman in Tokyo", and as one of
HAWN'a close contacte and friends in Japan. When interviewed by
representatives of this Agency ta 1958, Valentine HAiLN advised that
the above "George PARIS was the person who introduced HANN to a
Tokyo nightclub, located off the Ginza, the name of which HAHN gave
only as "The Tomorrow is Too Late Club". HAHN claimed that this
was an exact and direct translation into English of the actual Japanese
nama, which, however, he never mentioned during the interview.
Date of HAhn's visit to this "clab" in company of George PERIS aka
PARIS, is estimated to have been somewhere between 1954 and 1957.
HAUN stated that by the Torrow Is Too Late Club bo was intro-
deced to a Japanese hostess by the name of Noriko SMATSUZAΚΑΤΑ
alias Nortko AWAJL with whom HAHN subsequently enjoyed dates.
It is believed that Noriko MATSUZAKAYA AWAJI became the mistress
of Valentine HAY for an undetermined period of time following his
original introduction to her at the above "Club" while in the comраву
of George PERDTSALPCULAS aka PERIS aka PARIS. HAHN also
advised, that following his original introduction to this establishment
by PERIS, HARN had taken a number of renamed married American
nationals, who were stationed in Tokyo, to the same club, where sach
persons had also been introduced to and had enjoyed dates with the
bostesses. At this time, there is no information to indicate that
either William Hamilton -ARTIN or Berasa Ferguson AITCHELL
were among the United States cationals HAHN referred to as having
been taken to the aforementioned club by HAHN. Neither is there any
information currently availedis to reflect that William Hamilton
MARTIN was known to Valestine HAHN through their mutual acquaint-
anceship with George PARETERUPCULLS.

Is the Tokyo Branch manager of the firm of suh DuVICH BACTHERS

Invited specifically to the fact that Attachment reflects that the 1954
Japan Lirectory of Foreign Firms liste .. WTROVY as Tokyo
ropresentative of this firm, which has slices at ol - Tanura-che,
4-chome, Shiba, unete-ku, Tokyo, and telephone lines: 43-1809,

George PLRls, of PERIS ASSOCIATED ENTERPRISe, located at
14-3 Chome, Tamura-cho, sinato-ku, Tokyo, Telephones: 43-1809
and 43-4287, reflecting that he shared telephone numbers with
FONDOVICH BROTHERS, and presumably with nasael A. CSTROVSKY.
It is suggested that the Department of the Army, a
Chief of Stall, G-2, intelligence, and the Federal berena of lavestigation
rmay have additional information on George ParlaTiALPCULUS aka
PARIS and associates.
8. No additional information, to supplement that which is
reported in paragraph 6 above, identifiable with Noriko MAISUZAKAYA
GAVAJL could be located in the indices of this Agency.
9. With reference to the 'Tomorrow is Too Late Club', men-
tioned in paragraph 5 above, to which Valentine Haili claims to have
boea taken by Goutge PARIS, an exact and direct re-translation of the
club name into Japanese from the English as given by HAtit, would
read "Asu de wa Caosugiru", it is noted inai ine Talyo Telephone
Directory for 1957 contains a listing for an ostablishment of this
name, as follows: ASU DE WA CBusuclau, located at Chuo-ku,
Ginsa, 8-Chome, 3 Banchi, Tokyo-te, Telephone No.: 57-0945,
57-6363, 57-6928. A reliable source, who is familiar with the city of
Tokyo, advised in Lctober 1760, that as of 1959 this establishment
was still operating at the listed location, and that it is a collee-bosse
rather than a nightclub in the westera senso, although alcoholic
beverages are available for consumption en the premises by the
patrons. The same source also adviced that the above collee-house
employs Japanese hostesses", as is customary in such establishments
In Japan, and that such females might be dated under the circu
stances indicated by Valentine HAIN. However, it should be noted
SEGRET
14-00000
SECRET
that the same source also indicated that the coffee-bosse known as
ASU DE WA CELAUGIRU to which he was referring, which is identical
with the establishment of this name listed in the 1957 Tokyo Directory,
is the type of place which is not frequsated in general by American
nationals stationed in or visiting Tokyo as tourists; rather it caters
mainly to indigenous patrons and their gueste, or to foreign residonts
of Tokyo who have boon lastroduced to the place and the management by
Indigenous patrons. Thooo foreignors then becoine regular patrons
efter bocoming known to the management, inasmuch so the above
describod ASU DE VA (Bcsugiau cotise-bouse generally fits the
description of the "Tomorrow is Ico Lese Club" mentioned by
Valentine HAHN as a nightclub" to which he was taken by George
PERIS, it is suggested that they are one and the same establishments.
16. In light of the mutual acquaintancechip of William K. MARTIN
and Valentine HARN with George FLRBT ERCPOULIS aka PERIS, and
in tura, PERIS' role vis-a-vis tMANN's introduction to the ASU DE WA
(JCSUGIRU coffee-house, it is suggested that FARIS may have played
a similar role in terms of introducing siliam JARTIN to Japanes
night-life. This may hava eventually led to MARTI's contact and
involvement with Japanese individuals, who introduced him to or
indsiged his masochistic interests,
11. Additional information on the individuals mentioned above
will be forwarded as developed. It is requested that addressees for.
