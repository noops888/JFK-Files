IN DECEMBER 1976 THE SOURCE OF PARAGRAPHS 6-8 OF
REFERENCE REPORTED THAT IN JULY OR AUGUST 1976, DURING A MEETING OF
A GROUP OF CUBAN EXILES AT THE PIZZA RESTAURANT IN THE DOMINICAN
REPUBLIC, ARMANDO CABALLEROS, OWNER OF THE RESTAURANT, SPOKE OPENLY
ABOUT PLANS TO ASSASSINATE "UN GRAN FUNCIONARIO AMERICANO" IN COSTA
RICA.
(HEADQUARTERS' COMMENT: PLEASE SEE CIOL-0445-74, 23 DECEMBER
1976, WHICH PROVIDED YOU WITH INFORMATION ON TERRORIST PLOTTING OF
CUBAN EXILES AND INFORMATION RELATING TO THE ACTIVITIES OF U.S.
ARMY MAJOR MONTES. IN RELATION TO THE PARAGRAPH TWO MEETING, SOURCE
REPORTED THAT THE PARTICIPANTS DISCUSSED THE FACT THAT FORMER
SECRETARY OF STATE KISSINGER MET IN EITHER MEXICO OR COSTA RICA WITH
"AN IMPORTANT FIGURE IN THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT NAMED HART" (PROBABLY
ARMANDO HART DAVALOS). KISSINGER WAS LABELED A TRAITOR AND PLANS
WERE DISCUSSED TO ASSASSINATE HIM IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA. THE

ONE ARMANDO CABALLERO PARODI, WHO WAS BORN IN HAVANA ON
10 JULY 1943, WAS A FORMER MEMBER OF THE 2506 BRIGADE. HE WAS
TERMINATED BY THIS AGENCY IN MAY 1963. IN LATE 1963 THERE WAS
INTEREST IN USING CABALLERO IN TEACHING INFILTRATION TECHNIQUES BUT
THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT HE WAS CONTACTED IN THIS REGARD.
THIS AGENCY HAS NO INFORMATION ON DANILO GONZALEZ, IDENTI-
FIED AS PRESIDENT OF THE CUBAN CLUB IN SANTO DOMINGO, OR ON LOCAL
EMPLOYEES OF THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN SANTO DOMINGO, JOSE RENE ROMAN,
JOSE JEREZ OR FRANKLIN POLANCO.
JORGE ALONSO PUJOLS IS PROBABLY IDENTICAL WITH JORGE ALONSO-
PUJOL BERMUDEZ WHO WAS BORN IN HAVANA ON 20 JULY 1923. HE IS THE
SON OF FORMER CUBAN VICE PRESIDENT GUILLERMO ALONSO-PUJOL, WHO SERVED
DURING THE ADMINISTRATION OF CARLOS PRIO. ALONSO-PUJOL RECEIVED
SECRET
14-00000
TRAINING FROM THIS AGENCY DURING 1963 AND WAS CAPTURED IN THE BAY
OF PIGS. HIS FATHER PURPORTEDLY PAID $300,000 FOR HIS SON'S RELEASE.
HOWEVER, AT THE TIME THE RANSOM WAS EFFECTED, THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE
SPECULATION AMONG EXILES IN THE MIAMI AREA THAT HIS FATHER DID NOT
PAY THE RANSOM BUT HAD MADE A DEAL WITH THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT FOR
ALONSO-PUJOL TO UNDERTAKE PRO-CASTRO PROPAGANDA IN LATIN AMERICA IN
EXCHANGE FOR HIS FREEDOM. ALONSO-PUJOL WAS ARRESTED IN MIAMI IN
JUNE 1970 ON NARCOTICS-RELATED CHARGES. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE
DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL PERTINENT INFOR-
MATION ON JORGE ALONSO-PUJOL BERMUDEZ.
THIS AGENCY HAS BEEN UNABLE TO POSITIVELY IDENTIFY
ERNESTO HERNANDEZ BASED ON THE LACK OF PERTINENT BIOGRAPHIC INFORMA-
TION.
PABLO MARTIN IS THE PEN NAME USED BY AVENOL FRANCO, WHO IS
ALSO KNOWN AS FRANCISCO AVENOL. FRANCO, WHO MAY NOT BE IDENTICAL
WITH THE MARTIN MENTIONED IN REFERENCE, WAS BORN IN HAVANA ON 26 JUNE
