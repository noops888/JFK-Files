(CIA, Mexico City, was requested to furnish any

in Mexico and deportation. On 10/1/74( Mr. ROD MARSHALLYC
advised that he had furnished some information which he
believed originated with the Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA) to FERNANDO GUTIERREZ BARRIOS, the Subsecretary of
Government (Gobernacion), the agency which deported subject.
He believed this was done some weeks before subject was de
tained and deported
He did not recall exact circumstances
but thought perhaps (Mr. HARRINGTON, who was coordinating
with DEA at the time, might have asked him to do this
MARSHALL advised that after subject was detained, GUTIERREZ (C)
BARRIOS called them to notify them of the detention and that
subject was going to be deported
In subsequent contact, GUTIERREZ BARRIOS said that
this action was taken because subject was illegally in Mexico
Sand that the action was notebased on any activities of a
criminal nature which might be considered in violation of
Mexican law. At one point (GUTIERREZ BARRIOS explained it by
saying simply that the subject's papers were ond papers were not in order

"On 23 May 1974 we asked a high-level source
within the Mexican Secretariat of Gobernacion for
information that that they might have on Sam GIANCANA.
The Department of Immigration is under the
Secretariat of Gobernacion, soi so it was believed that
(they might have some information on GIANCANA. We
never received a reply to this request. In July
1974, however, our contact within Gobernacion told
us that the Government of Mexico (GOM) was expelling
GIANCANA from the country, to the United States,
within 24 hours
"In meetings held with our contact on 23 August,
28 September, and 1 October 1974, we brought up the
subject of GIANCANA., The contract said that the
local immigration authorities had been seeking
GIANCANA because he was in the country illegally.
They finally located him in July, arrested him on
the spot, and deported him the following day.
expulsion was not carried out on the basis of any
specific information supplied by the US Embassy, nor
.were there any indications that he was engaged in
any criminal activity here. Rather it was an
internal GOM decision to expel an unwanted alien
who was living illegally in Mexico

and is somewhat contradictory
In further explanation 10/2/74 Mr. MARSHALL said he (C]
now believes (Mr. HARRINGTON had asked him merely to determine (
if Gobernacion had any information on the subject since
MARSHALL believed subject may have been designated by the
embassy Narcotics Committee as a so-called "joint target." [C]
He stated he did not believe that he had indicated in any
manner to GUTIERREZ BARRIOS that the embassy thought subject (C)
was involved in narcotics activities in Mexico. He did
mentioned the possibility that because of emphasis being
placed on narcotics by both governments, high Mexican officials
might have reached the decision that subject should be ex-
pelled because of his widely publicized connections with the
MAFIA(C)
