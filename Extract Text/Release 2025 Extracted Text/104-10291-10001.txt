Director of Personnel
SUBJECT
: Mr. Joseph Burkholder Smith
1. (U) Action Requested: None; this memorandum is in response
to your request of 15 May 1978 to provide you with a very brief rundown
on Mr. Joseph Burkholder Smith.
2. (C) Mr. Smith was born in 1921, holds B.A. and M.A. degrees in
History and has studied at the Ph.D. level in this field. He served
as a Corporal in the U.S. Army (1943-46) and from 1946-51 he was an
Assistant Professor of History at Dickinson College. He entered on duty
with the Agency in September 1951 as a GS-09 and reached the GS-14 level
before his retirement in June 1973. At the time of his retirement, he
was assigned to the DIXO/Western Hemisphere Division. He received the
Career Intelligence Medal. Overseas assignments included Singapore
1954-56; Manila 1958-60; Buenos Aires 1962-66; and his last assignment,
Mexico City 1969-73.
3. (S) Apparently after retirement, he wrote a book, Portrait of
a Cold Warrior, which he did not submit for security review or for DCI
approval. His book was already printed in advance uncorrected proofs
when the Agency first learned of its publication. It contained classified
information; however, the Office of General Counsel advised us that it was
the final decision of this Agency and the Department of Justice that we
would not pursue civil action against Mr. Smith. In this sort of action
you mist prove damages. The Operations Directorate was reluctant for
security and sensitivity reasons to point up those areas wherein we
had been damaged.
4. (U) In the event you wish to read further on this subject,
we have attached papers furnished us by Mr. John Greaney of the Office of
General Counsel.

By Joseph Burkholder Smith
TWENTY-FIFTH college reunions are great occasions
for letting the world know how well you're done, and
mine was no exception. All my old classmates, it seemed,
had become assistant secretaries of state or vice presidents
of General Motors or had acquired some equally impressive
titles. So it was a little embarrassing when they'd ask me
what I was up to:
Not that I hadn't done well myself - I was at the time
fairly high up in the Central Intelligence Agency. But I
wasn't allowed to say that, so when they asked, I had to
mumble something vague about being a civilian employee
at Patrick Air Force base, an excuse that I could tell, con-
jured up images of genteel failure - too much drinking perhaps - in
the people who heard it.
Not being able to impress my old classmates was a small
wound, but it symbolizes an important problem for CIA
agents. We live in a society where lots of people plan their
lives so as to accumulate the greatest possible number of
credentials of the sort that will wow their peers at reunions
and similar moments. These credentials are for many Americans a
sense of identity and of security: CIA people are by no
means immune to the desire to impress people with
credentials, but their jobs are directly at odds with that
urge. In that way and several others, we in the CIA have
been deprived of the normal ego supports of the American
life of our time, and how we dealt with (and didn't deal
with) their absence from our lives has had something to do
with how our agency has (and hasn't) done its job.
It wasn't just our status among our peers that suffered as
a result of our work. Normal family life was a victim too.
The CIA's Clandestine Services division has for years had
the highest divorce rate of any organization in the govern-
ment. Part of the reason is that recruits of my generation of
clandestine operators were instructed never to tell their
wives what they were really doing. "Just say it's a question
of national security," they told us when we had to take one
of our frequent absences from home.
Of course, many men also discovered quickly what an im-
provement that lying was over the old "working late at the
office" routine and took advantage of it. Still, most of the
marital problems came not from philandering but from the
unspectacular, bitter toll that living under cover takes on
people. Officers with good marriages must tell their wives
in general terms what kind of work keeps them out at night,
but they have to imply that the wives give up to hint. The first
thing a CIA wife learns is never to ask another woman what
her husband does, for fear she will be asked the same ques-
tion.
CIA wives also have to join their husbands in deceiving
their children in the dark. When schools are promoting drives in
which the kids' fathers tell their classes about their fascinat-
ing work, she has to help invent reasons why her child can't
volunteer for his father's participation. When the child wants to
visit his father's office, she has to invent reasons why his
!
hiro Da This kind of travail makes many women wonder if
it's worth the effort.
Talking to Yourselves
A CIA AGENT is stationed in Washington, he has to get
used to being asked at every party, by every stranger he
meets, "What do you do?" Personal qualities like kindness,
good temper, or intelligence - even good looks and nearly
- mean nothing in the nation's capital compared with
where one stands in the pecking order. A CIA couple who
maintain their cover are quickly "selected out" of any party
they go to and end up in a corner talking to themselves.
CIA wives, particularly, feel this constant social failure
deeply and resent it. Until the women's movement, most
women were raised to channel their ambitions toward the
areas of party-giving and cooking. When married to a CIA
agent, they felt they were denied these things because of
their husbands' work, and their marriages got into trouble.
When CIA families go abroad they find their lives even
more disrupted by status anxieties. The American official
community, centered at the embassy, spends more time and
effort than the Soviet KGB trying to discover who are the
CIA families. If a CIA officer is assigned to the embassy
under the guise of being in the Foreign Service, the U.S.
Information Service, or the Agency for International Devel-
opment, the real employees of those organizations ferret the
CIA agents out and then take pains to treat them as second-
class citizens. The government employees who are "legitimate"
embassy personnel don't speak to them at all. If they
arrive at the embassy under deep cover, with no false iden-
tity, then not even the other CIA personnel speak to them.
The game of uncovering the CIA people is made simple
for the "legitimate" embassy personnel by a number of
means. The State Department won't let CIA agents call
themselves, as a cover, Foreign Service Officers; they have
to say they're "Foreign Service Reserve" or "Foreign Ser-
vice Staff" officers. Real FSOs, as they're called, are rarely
involved in real political jobs, so the CIA's people listed as
"FSR political officers" are obvious to one and all.
In the same status-preserving spirit, the State Department
used to publish an annual Biographical Register - a who's who
of the Foreign Service - that included information on de-
grees, jobs, and murky pasts. It was declassified in 1973, and the
numbers of several CIA agents that State made the Biographical
Register a classified document.
Envy, Jealousy, and Distrust
THERE ARE several ways to deal with the problem of
credentials. One is to rise above the worries of society.
Another is to learn to laugh them off, even if they are
painful. Unfortunately, however, there wasn't a way of
handling the trade-off between your career and your status
is to grasp more of the first to get more of the second. In
foreign capitals CIA agents often have been envied by the
Important that they've made their secret jobs obvious,
which has not only brought them envy, jealousy, and dis-
trust, but has made it very hard for them to do their job of
intelligence gathering properly.
"Do you know that CIA people are paid double salaries to
serve abroad?" the new political officer in Singapore said to
me when I showed my family around the Singapore Swimming
Club on the Sunday after he arrived. "They get paid twice as
much as you or I do. They get paid for their cover jobs and
then paid again for their hanky-panky work. That's why they
live better than we do."
I felt flattered that I was holding my cover well enough to
be told his secret, and I only wished what he was saying
were true.
But it was an impression that was understandable, if erro-
neous. CIA officers did serve in covers that were lower in
rank than their real jobs, and both on the job and off, they
didn't live lives consistent with the rank they were pretend-
ing to have. For reasons of their jobs, agents cultivate con-
tacts in the local government and other diplomatic missions
in circles far higher than people of their cover rank ever
have a chance to meet. And they insist on renting the kind
of houses to which their CIA rank entitles them, as well as
demanding and receiving a lot of special perquisites. My
new friend was wrong about the double salaries, but all the
CIA officers he had seen abroad would certainly have given
him the impression that he had about that sort of compensation.
In particular, most CIA station chiefs are not content to
live in quarters much less grand than the ambassador's offi-
cial residence. In many countries, this makes sense; the
CIA has liaison responsibilities that are officially recog-
nized by the ambassador and the State Department. But this is not
appreciated by the lower-level employees of the embassy, if
it's told to them at all. Resentment of the chief of station's
life style bubbles up.
In the past, many chiefs of state made no attempt to hide
their preference for dealing with the CIA station chief
rather than the ambassador - sometimes because they owed a
great deal to the chief, who may have stolen the election for
them or financed the coup that put them in power. In any
case, CIA station chiefs have always felt they could not
entertain where they were seen in hovels. It would be detri-
mental to the prestige and interests of the United States,
they argue, if they did not have the rank and accoutrements
of the foreigners with whom they deal. One station chief I
knew once told me that he had once been given a promotion by
the gambit it has served many a CIA trend well in regard to its
labor relations. A former station chief in Saigon gave a vivid
account of the perquisites his personnel enjoyed in Viet-
nam. They had their own bowl club, swimming pool, and cars
in the 1960s and '70s. And it was customary for CIA officers
to have chauffeurs - because the nationals that you needed
somebody around to guard CIA cars against looting. Since the
cars were government property, the gas and maintenance costs,
as well as the chauffeur, were paid for out of the station's
housekeeping funds. People who were listed as lowly attachés
were often seen driving around in big, unmarked, chauffeured
cars, which drove the Foreign Service Officers into frenzies of
envy.
"We'll Entertain Ourselves"
EVEN WORSE, perhaps, than using perquisites to fend
off the pangs of status anxiety is CIA people's tendency
to huddle together. If the rest of the world thought we were
nondescript Army officers and the like, well, we know who
was and wasn't who and could play the game with each
other. The other embassy personnel won't invite us to their
parties? We're too low on the diplomatic list to get invited to
the important functions given by other embassies and by offi-
cials of the local government? Well, we'll entertain ourselves.
Conscientious CIA officers try hard to curb this practice,
which after all is a breach of nearly every tenet of good se-
curity, but they fail more often than they succeed.
In the days when our national purpose was more clearly
defined, when we would, in the words of John F. Kennedy,
pay any price and bear any burden in defense of the free
world, it didn't matter so much if the cover of CIA person-
nel was a little thin. In some countries, the prestige of the
agency was even higher than it was at home, enormously
higher than it has been at home for the last three years. In
the Philippines in the late 1960s, the CIA was so well re-
garded that members of the Army Counter Intelligence Corps
used to try to recruit Filipinos by passing themselves off as
CIA agents. Today, the open life style of a station chief can
lead to his death, as it did for Richard Welch in Athens.
Welch was killed by the gun of an anti-American assassin,
but the gun was put into the assassin's hand by all the de-
fenses against the dilemma of covert life that I've described.
Welch lived in a house inherited from past station chiefs,
everyone in the embassy knew his true position, and his bio-
graphy appeared in the Biographical Register, which could be
found in any library.
After Welch died, the register was credibly classified,
but that doesn't mean an end to the problem. CIA personnel
will always feel a strain from having to pretend to be much
less successful than they really are. Even if they love their
work and believe in it deeply, they'll still feel pangs. That's
human nature, and while we ought to curb the obviousness
of CIA agent identities, to some extent we're just got to
deal with it.
One way to do that is to treat CIA agents sympathetically.
These are obviously people who have sacrificed something
to work for the agency, and who depend to an inordinate
extent on having stable relationships with their co-workers,
since they can't have stable relationships with anyone else.
The main thing in an agent's life - practically the only
thing, for many - is how he's treated at Langley, where he
stands there.
So when Adm. Stansfield Turner quickly fired 320 Clandestine
Services officers last year, my initial approval (some of
those fired, I thought, must have been the people who made
me decide to leave the CIA in 1973) gave way to misgivings.
It's true that the greatest physical hazard many spooks
have ever faced is the danger of choking on the pit of the
olive in their martinis. But the greatest hazard we all face is
not physical danger; it's having something eat away at our
souls. No one has to be a clandestine operator, of course,
but once he is, he is deprived of the normal means of sus-
taining his self-image that prevails in our society.
I don't mean Turner should have kept on incompetents. But
I'm sure that after then a fringe everybody else at Langley
felt bitter and frightened. These are not, after all, people
who have anything else to fall back on, and they need a lot of
rapport from their organization. Turner has to keep these
people, and if he wants to use them effectively, he ought to
find a way of letting them go while making the rest feel secure.

Service Journal, is a former high CIA official.

Mr. Joseph B. Smith has made an outstanding contribution to CIA opera-
tions for the past 21 years. He has consistently received strong/outstand-
ing efficiency reports in a wide variety of assignments, including two in
the Far East (Singapore/Malaya and Manila) and two in Latin America (Buenos
Aires and Mexico City). At Headquarters he served as Chief of the Malaya/
Australia Branch in FE Division, on the CA Staff, in WII Division on the Ven-
ezuelan Desk and the Division CA Staff, and in OTR on a rotational tour.
Mr. Smith is a recognized authority on Covert Action. While with OTR
he was commended for his efforts in completely revamping the CA curriculum.
In close coordination with the CA Staff he organized two totally new CA
seminars, both of which evoked a very positive response. He also received
praise for organizing and conducting a training course for military officers
destined for Saigon where they were to conduct psychological warfare opera-
tions. In Argentina he worked in liaison with local services on Covert Ac-
tion operations. This work with liaison was rated as outstanding. He de-
veloped a long-time agent in one of the services to a point where the pro-
duct was considerably improved. Political contacts at all levels developed
by: Mr. Smith in Mexico City have been instrumental in developing dissemin-
able intelligence. In all his assignments his rating officers have consis-
tely praised his imagination, flexibility, enthusiasm, perception and
professionalism.
Mr. Smith's career has been one of exceptional achievement and he has
made an outstanding contribution to the Agency's Covert Action program and
to Agency training. His record of commendations and sustained superior per-

CLA Director Adm. Stansfield Turner.
So when Adm. Stansfield Turner quickly fired 320 Clandestine
Services officers last year, my initial approval (some of
those fired, I thought, must have been the people who
made me decide to leave the CIA in 1973) gave way to misgivings.
It's true that the greatest physical hazard many spooks
have ever faced is the danger of choking on the pit of the
olive in their martinis. But the greatest hazard we all face is
not physical danger; it's having something eat away at our
souls. No one has to be a clandestine operator, of course,
but once he is, he is deprived of the normal means of sus-
taining his self-image that prevails in our society.
I don't mean Turner should have kept on incompetents. But
I'm sure that after then a fringe everybody else at Langley
felt bitter and frightened. These are not, after all, people
who have anything else to fall back on, and they need a lot of
rapport from their organization. Turner has to keep these
people, and if he wants to use them effectively, he ought to
find a way of letting them go while making the rest feel secure.

Service Journal, is a former high CIA official.
