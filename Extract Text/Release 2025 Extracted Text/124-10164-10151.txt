The following information was provided by our repre-
sentativersin Rio de Janeiro and is being forwarded for your

a. An unidentified caller phoned the Consul General

Agency officer interviewed the individual on 30 January in the
Consulate.

b. At first, the walk-in refused to identify him-
self or give the names of persons in his story, but agreed to
do so after the interviewer impressed on him the importance
when evaluating information of the identity of the source and
of the other persons involved. The walk-in reluctantly pro-
duced an ID card (106751 issued by the technical police on
8/29/66) identifying himself as Laszlo KOVACS, born 30 Octo-
ber 1926 in Sao Paulo of Hungarian parents Gergchy and Pasti BORRALO.
According to kovaes at age five he returned to
Europe with his parents and lived in Hungary and Yugoslavia,
mostly the latter, until 1961 when he returned to Brazil.
He stands about five feet seven inches, stocky build, hazel
eyes, no glasses, light brown hair receding at the temples and
graying. His hands appear those of a mason, which the claim
to be. The interview was conducted in Portuguese of which

cause of Vlasenco's nationality, and the timing of the assassi-
nation six months after the blockade of Cuba, Kovacs concludes
that the assassination was ordered by "Brezhnev and Fidel
Castro."
e. Vlasenco told Kovacs in November, 1963 that he
rented the apartment, dealt in precious stones, and had lived
there for four years. Vlasenco was away from the apartment dur-
ing the day, dressed well, had no family and no car. Kovacs
guesses he saw him three times during the two week period.
f. Kovacs asked that the above story be passed to
Senator Edward Kennedy, and at first refused to identify himself
and the characters in his story to anyone but the Senator or
his emissary because he was afraid for his life. It was for
that reason also that he claims he did not come forward until
Kovacs was assured that his story would not appear in
any newspaper or magazine (which he feared would happen), but
would be sent to Washington by a coded message. Towards the
end of the interview Kovacs alluded to his need for money
(CR $500,000 about US $11,500) to fund his inventions; one a
dirigible which could carry "any amount of cargo," and one a
pump which could pump liquids hundreds of miles. When asked
if he had made an effort to interest local entrepreneurs, Kovacs
replied that he had expended considerable effort, "but they
laugh at me." Kovacs appears to have a confused thinking
process and lively imagination and his story is contradictory.
He probably came forward in the hope that his information
would be worth money. We do not know whether he himself be-
lieves the story he related.
2. Our representative in Rio de Janeiro has been advised
to have no further contact with Kovacs. Should addees wish to
pursue the matter, Kovacs' present address is Rua A. 46, Vila
Luiza, Pavuna, Rio de Janeiro.
3. This Agency has no identifiable traces on Kovacs or
Vlasenco.
