At 2:30 p.m. on June 2, 1975, a conference was held
with the Deputy Attorney General attended by K. William O'Connor,
Kevin Maroney, Philip White, and Robert McDermott of the Department.
Bureau representatives were Mr. Callahan, Mr. Adams, Mr. Wannall and me.
Mr. O'Connor discussed the request by the Senate Select
Committee for access to the 39 page report by former Assistant Attorney
General Petersen concerning COINTELPRO. Though objections were
presented by the Bureau representatives that the report should not be
furnished to the Committee, and its enclosures, particularly the legal
memoranda should not be made available, the Deputy Attorney General
decided and instructed that the 39 page report should be made available
to John Elliff on Tuesday, June 3, 1975, for his review, at which time he
would be permitted to take notes, but he would not be furnished a copy of
the document. The Deputy further instructed that should Mr. Elliff request
the attachments to the report, Mr. O'Connor should offer as an alternative
the memoranda which initiated each of the COINTELPROS.
Upon our return to the Bureau, Mr. Adams requested that the
Intelligence Division undertake an analysis of each of the summaries which
were attached to the Petersen report in order to make a damage assessment
based on factors that would affect current Bureau operations should they be
revealed to the Committee. He also requested that this information be
compiled and available to brief the Deputy Attorney General as to the
difficulties that would be involved upon disclosure. T JUN 101975,

At the Executives Conference on May 22, 1975, I presented for
discussion the question of the procedures to be followed when former employees
or current employees of the Bureau are contacted for interview by staff
representatives of the Senate Select Committee, or are called for testimony
pursuant to a subpoena issued by the Committee. I explained the background
including the numerous attempts to arrive at a working arrangement with
the Committee in terms of stated guidelines and that all such efforts in the
past had proven unworkable.
I pointed out that when presented with the proposal that an agency
representative be present during interviews, the Committee met and voted
unanimously to reject that proposal. The issue of whether the agency
representative would be present during the interview therefore is a stumbling
block to the development of a reasonable procedure to be followed by the
Committee and by our present and former employees. I requested the
authority of the Executives Conference and approval of the Director to waive
the requirement that a Bureau representative be present during interviews
and following a vote such approval was given.
I then requested authority to undertake the development of a
working understanding with the Committee in behalf of the Bureau by which
we would be given notice of the identities of persons to be interviewed prior to
interview or testimony, that we would be advised of the subject matter of the

Interview or testimony, and afforded an opportunity to discuss with the
witness those areas of the proposed interview or testimony which would
require no special arrangements and those areas which would require the
information possessed by the witness to be furnished to members of the
Committee or to the Chairman exclusively.
We also wanted an opportunity prior to interview to furnish the
witnesses information concerning their Constitutional rights, their rights
pursuant to the Committee's rules, and to advise them concerning the extent
to which they were released from obligations of secrecy made to the FBI, and
to the procedures necessary to obtain authority of the Department to respond
to a subpoena.
Following discussion and vote this matter also was approved.
Pursuant to such authority, I met with K. William O'Connor,
Deputy Assistant Attorney General, from approximately 4:00p.m. to 5:20 p. m.
on May 22, 1975, accompanied by Inspector John B. Hotis. I explained to
Mr. O'Connor that the Director was desirous of having the Committee under-
stand that the FBI wanted to be cooperative to the extent that it was possible
and consistent with the need to protect the identities of informants, sensitive
sources of information and methods, on-going investigations and other current
operations and personal privacy. Because of this view of the Director and the
Bureau, we desired to make known to the Committee the fact that we would
not insist on the presence of a Bureau representative during actual interviews
or testimony of present or former employees, but we would want an under-
standing with the Committee and the Committee staff that the Bureau would
be given prior notice of the identities of proposed witnesses, the subject
matter of the proposed interview or testimony, and an opportunity prior to
interview or testimony for the Bureau to consult with the employee in order
to release him from his obligations of secrecy to the extent possible for
purposes of the interview or testimony.
I restated our position that we were not endeavoring to deter
testimony rather we were attempting to facilitate testimony under reasonable
conditions and we felt that these matters should be discussed with the
Committee. I told Mr. O'Connor that we were aware of the numerous
discussions, proposals and conferences that have been held in an effort
to establish specific formal guidelines with the Committee, but that all such
efforts in behalf of the White House staff and the intelligence community at

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee
large have not been successful. I told him that therefore we felt it would
be appropriate for the FBI to express our view to the Committee because
interviews of FBI personnel and former employees have been conducted
and are scheduled in the near future.
Mr. O'Connor said that he understood the Director's view that
he desired to cooperate with the Committee and he felt that such cooperation
could be negotiated if we were to offer the Committee as trading material
COINTELPRO files. I told Mr. O'Connor that we were not going to negotiate
an understanding concerning witness interview procedures on the basis of
trading any of our files. He then suggested that we negotiate the May 14,
1975, letter which was addressed to the Attorney General by Senator Church
and use that negotiation as a basis for trading with the Committee to develop
workable guidelines. I again told Mr. O'Connor that I considered the question
of procedural arrangements for witness interviews to be a very broad question and
one that went far beyond the requests in the May 14, 1975, letter. I told him
that I felt confident that the May 14, 1975, letter would be followed by perhaps
an even longer letter with more requests and that such matters should be
negotiated individually.
Mr. O'Connor then said that it was his strong view that a letter
should be addressed to the Committee complaining of the treatment of FBI
witnesses, particularly regarding violations of the Committee's own rules
in that it appeared that during recent interviews the Committee had not
furnished witness a copy of the rules in sufficient time and the treatment by
staff representatives & the Committee staff of witnesses had been improper.
I told Mr. O'Connor that I thought that our efforts to develop
a working relationship with the Committee could be seriously impaired at
this time should a protest letter be sent to Senator Church because a formal
communication of that nature would require some reaction on the part of the
Committee and I could see no benefit to our present efforts to establish
procedures by which we could reasonably cooperate with the Committee.
Mr. O'Connor then suggested that a letter might be addressed
to Senator Church which described our concern that in the absence of
reasonable procedures witnesses' rights might be impaired and that for that
NW 88296 Docld:32989588 Page 101

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee
reason and for the reason that the Director desired to be cooperative with
the Committee, we would request a meeting with Senator Church and
Senator Tower to arrive at an understanding as to procedures. I told
Mr. O'Connor that I would consider such a letter and he would discuss
the matter with the Deputy Attorney General and with James Wilderotter
at the White House.
At approximately 9:05 a.m. on May 23, 1975, Mr. O'Connor
called me and said that he had discussed the matter with Mr. Wilderotter
and the Deputy Attorney General. He said that both had agreed that it was
inopportune at this time to seek special guidelines for interviews of FBI
personnel and former personnel with the Committee. He said that a meeting
has been scheduled for Tuesday, May 27, 1975, at noon in a final
effort to resolve an understanding with Committee representatives. He
said at the present time it is proposed that the meeting be attended by
Wilderotter and Roderick Hills, representing the White House; Hoffman,
representing the Defense Department; Warner, representing CIA; and
O'Connor representing the Justice Department. Committee representatives
would be Schwarz, Chief Counsel, and John Elliff. He said that at this
time it was his thought that the Deputy Attorney General and I should not
attend the meeting. He gave as his reasoning the thought that "should
something go wrong" the Deputy Attorney General could disassociate himself
from any agreement arrived at, and that I would similarly be in a position
of saying that we have not been a party to the agreement.
I reminded Mr. O'Connor that meetings have been held frequently
in the past and that tentative understandings made at such meetings have dis-
appeared shortly after the meeting was concluded. I told him that was
significant to us because we now understand that two more former
employees of the FBI have been contacted and may be interviewed in the
near future. I told him that former SA Sam Papich and former Agent Nichols
have been contacted. I told him that the extent to which we should release
these two former employees from their obligation of secrecy could not be
intelligently evaluated unless we knew the subject matter of the interviews
and that we plan to contact the Committee to inquire as to the subject
matter. I pointed out to him that such pending interviews make it imperative
for the FBI to consider action in addition to meetings that may be planned
to discuss guidelines.
NW 88296 Docld:32989588 Page 102

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee
at this time, but that we allow him to call John Elliff and Schwarz to
request that he be advised of the identity of all proposed FBI witnesses
and of the subject matter of the proposed interviews, and that such inter-
views or testimony not go forward pending developments of an agreement
on guidelines. O'Connor promised that he would make the contact promptly
and advise me today of the results. I agreed to withhold our contact
pending receipt of the information from him.
Mr. O'Connor then insisted that a letter be prepared for the
Attorney General to send to Senator Church pointing out the failure of the
Committee to afford complete protection of the rights of witnesses. I
declined to undertake that responsibility and I told him the reason was that
a formal document addressed to the Chairman of the Committee would tend
to impair our efforts to negotiate with the Committee and certainly would be
untimely in view of the conference he described as being scheduled for next
Tuesday at noon.
Mr. O'Connor then said he would hate to have to tell the Deputy
Attorney General that the FBI declined to prepare such a draft. I told him
that not only would I not mind him telling the Deputy Attorney General, but
I wished he would tell the Deputy Attorney General and explain my reason
for not sending such a formal letter addressed to Senator Church at this
time. Mr. O'Connor said that "well everyone else agrees to the letter, "
and I told him the FBI does not agree.
Mr. O'Connor said that if he was going to have to draft the
letter for the Attorney General's signature, he would do it, but that he would
need the information concerning the interviews of former SA Devlin and
former SA Sentinella. I told Mr. O'Connor that the information concerning
Sentinella was en route to him already and that we would endeavor to
furnish him as promptly as possible any additional information available
to us concerning these interviews.
At 11:13 a.m. on May 23, 1975, Mr. O'Connor called me and
said that he had just concluded a conversation with John Elliff during which
Elliff agreed that in regard to the scheduled interview of former SA Sam Papich
on May 29, 1975, at 9:00a.m., he would furnish us the substance of the
NW 88296 Docld:32989588 Page 103

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee
questions to be asked Mr. Papich. He said that Elliff was agreeable to
an informal arrangement under which the FBI would not require the
presence of a Bureau representative at such interviews, but would expect
to receive the identity of persons to be interviewed plus a statement as to
the subject matter of the interview. Elliff then proceeded to identify as
those persons scheduled for interview as William Turner, who will be
interviewed today or this weekend by Mike Epstein at San Francisco, and
"Chick" Brennan, who was interviewed yesterday, May 22, 1975, by Mark
Gitenstein and who may be interviewed again today.
As to the interview of Sam Papich, Elliff said that the interview
would concern:
1. A liaison agreement between the FBI and CIA;
2. The abolition of Papich's liaison responsibilities in 1970;
3. Dissatisfaction by the FBI with the Huston Plan;
4. The views in the White House regarding the intelligence
community and the FBI with reference to a conversation Elliff had with
Mr. Wannall and Mr. Cregan on May 22, 1975;
5. A detailed follow-up on the discussions with Mr. Wannall;.
6. A copy of the Huston Plan and certain minutes taken of
meetings at which the Huston Plan was discussed. These minutes allegedly
were made by William Cregar;
7. The matter raised with Paul Daly on May 22, 1975. (Mr. Daly
recalled that Mr. Elliff discussed an incident concerning the CIA and the
FBI which occurred at Denver, Colorado.)
Mr. O'Connor said that an interview proposed with former
SA Nichols has been postponed indefinitely according to Elliff because
of Nichols' unavailability.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee
Mr. O'Connor noted that even though formal current rules
have not been agreed upon with the Committee, it appears that Elliff's
cooperation in furnishing the above information indicates a willingness
to abide by the terms and conditions that I had requested Mr. O'Connor
to seek in behalf of the FBI.
In this developing cooperation with Elliff, it is my opinion that
we should not participate in the conference at noon on Tuesday, May 27, 1975,
at which time the broad proposals by Wilderotter will be discussed. It is
to the interest of the FBI to develop a cooperative attitude on the part of
Elliff and his staff and that is being accomplished.
RECOMMENDATION:
For information.
