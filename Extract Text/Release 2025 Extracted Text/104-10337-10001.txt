The Honorable John Conyers, Jr.
Chairman
Committee on Government Operations

Washington, D.C. 20515
Dear Mr. Chairman:
The Director has asked me to respond to your letter of
April 6, 1992 requesting certain information regarding CIA
holdings of records related to the assassination of
President Kennedy. We do have a significant number of records
relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy,
although many of these records were originated by the FBI or
by investigating committees of the Congress. We believe that
a significant portion of our records could be released if H.J.
Resolution 454 were enacted into law.
I should also point out that the Central Intelligence
Agency is currently embarking on its own review of
assassination records. I would expect that this review will
result in the public release of a significant body of
information.
To help the committee understand the nature and number of
CIA records pertaining to the assassination, I am enclosing
the answers to the specific questions you raised in your
letter.

Sincerely,
Stanley M. Moskowitz
Director of Congressional Affairs

1. Did the CIA retain possession of records requested by
or developed on behalf of the House Select Committee on
Assassinations? If so, how many pages of such records does
the Agency have in its possession? What is the nature of
these records?
Yes, the CIA retained possession of records requested by
or developed on behalf of the House Select Committee on
Assassinations (HSCA). The Agency has approximately 300,000
pages of such records which include microfilm of CIA's Oswald
file (originally collected in response to the Warren
Commission's inquiry, then added to) as well as records
collected in response to specific requests from the HSCA.
Although these records cover a wide variety of topics, they
principally focus on CIA operations against Cuba and Castro,
Lee Harvey Oswald's sojourn in the USSR, and Oswald's
activities in Mexico City and New Orleans. The vast majority
of documents pertaining to Oswald were created in response to
specific inquiries from the Warren Commission and HSCA. They
also include a large number of name traces requested by the
HSCA staff, as well as materials relating to the Garrison
investigation, Watergate, Cuban exile activities, and copies
of FBI reports relating to Oswald. Because the HSCA was also
investigating the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr., there is also some material on the Black Panthers and the
civil rights movement.
2. Does the CIA have records outside of those related to
the HSCA that may be considered relevant to the assassination
of President Kennedy? If so, please describe such records and
the approximate number of pages.
The CIA responded to requests from the Warren Commission
and the HSCA (approximately 300,000 pages, see above). The
CIA has never, however, attempted to locate every document
bearing on every conceivable angle or theory relating to the
assassination of President John F. Kennedy. If the Agency
were asked to explore newly advanced theories the search for
documents could be a rather large undertaking involving the
review of thousands of additional documents. To conduct any
further search, CIA would require specific guidelines
describing the kinds of records sought.
3. Did any of the records described in questions 1 and 2
originate with the FBI? If so, approximately how many?
We believe that between 40 percent and 50 percent of the
records described in questions 1 and 2 originated with the
FBI.
13-00000
4. Did any of these records originate with any other
Federal, foreign, state, or local agency? If so, please
describe which agencies and the approximate numbers.
A small number of CIA's records pertaining to the
assassination of JFK, probably less than 5%, originated with
the State Department and the Immigration and Naturalization
Service. Another small number of records, also less than 5%,
are original HSCA records stating Committee requests to CIA.
5. How many of these records have been reviewed for
release under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)? How many
of these records have been released pursuant to such requests?
CIA has released 7,432 pages of records pertaining to the
assassination of JFK, representing 1,969 documents, under the
FOIA. There is no documentation of how many JFK assassination
records CIA has reviewed under FOIA.
6. In the estimation of the CIA, approximately how many
records would be released under the standards contained in
House Joint Resolution 454?
It is very difficult to estimate the number of documents
that would be released if the Joint Resolution passed because
consideration for protection of classified information and
other sensitive categories of information would be required on
a document by document basis. We would review our holdings
carefully to ensure that the maximum amount of information is
released, consistent with the DCI's responsibility to protect
intelligence sources and methods and with privacy interests of
individuals involved.

ER 92-1316
I am please to learn that you will be testifying before
the Committee on Governmental Affairs on Tuesday, May 12,
1992. The hearing will begin at 9:00 a.m. and be held in Room
342 of the Dirksen Senate Building. The subject of the hearing
will be the "Assassination Materials Disclosure Act of 1992."
The legislation proposes to create an independent review board
to govern and coordinate the release of government information
relevant to the assassination of former President John F.
Kennedy. As required by Commmittee rules, please have 100
copies of your written testimony delivered to the Committee by
close of business, Friday, May 8, 1992. While your written
testimony may be as long as you wish, please plan to limit
your spoken testimony to five to seven minutes in length.
Your testimony will be extremely helpful to the Committee
and to the Congress as it considers this important
legislation. While you may discuss whatever aspects of the
legislation you desire, particularly how it relates to the
records and resources of your agency, the Committee would
appreciate learning your views on several specific subjects:
What are the reasons which the Central Intelligence
Agency has records related to the assassination of
President Kennedy?
What have the methods been to date for the identification
and definition of Central Intelligence Agency records as
material related to the assassination of President
Kennedy?
What steps has the Central Intelligence Agency made to
assess the scope of relevant documents outside of
materials requested by earlier investigative or other
official committees or commissions, or through the
Freedom of Information Act?
What is the volume of material which you might recommend
be released to the public without concern for further
postponement?

The Honorable Robe: M. Cates

Would you be opposed to a provision requesting agencies,
whenever possible, to self-certify materials which may
released without agency objection?
What recommendations can you make with regard to the need
for interagency working groups to identify third-agency
records in agency files, to avoid duplication, and to
assist in the efficient disclosure of information to the
public?
What are the logistical, manpower, and resource concerns
that you have with regard to the review and release of
assassination material?
Thank you for your assistance and consideration. I look
forward to seeing you on May 12th. In the event that you have
any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. Your
staff has already been very helpful to the Committee in its
preparation for the hearing. They may also contact Dr. Leonard
Weiss, Staff Director, or Steven Katz, Counsel, at

OUTLINE OF TESTIMONY ON JFK RESOLUTION
A. Agreement with Principles of Legislation.
1. Favor disclosure of as much material on JFK as
is consistent with protection of intelligence
sources and methods.
2. Established own declassification program.
Presumption will be in favor of disclosure.
3. Pledge to cooperate with any reasonable
mechanism to declassify documents.
B. Describe Nature and Amount of Records.
1. Reasons for having records.
2. Volume of existing material and who it belongs
to.
3. How we have identified material related to JFK
assassination.
C. How Much Material Can be Released?
1. Give estimate of amount of material to be
released under CIA program or resolution.
2. Describe material that could not be disclosed.
a. Example of Intelligence Sources and
Methods that would require withholding.
b. Example of material the release of which
would invade privacy.
3. Describe resources--manpower and funds--to
achieve results.
D. Concerns with Resolutions.
1. Address only Intelligence Community Concerns.
Will defer to DoJ on Constitutional objections.

2. CIA or other agencies that originate documents
should conduct initial review of material to
determine whether it can be released. Material
withheld from public release could then be made
available to Review Board.
3. Agencies that originate information should be
allowed to review it for release even if that
information is contained in a document prepared by
another agency or Congress. Suggest interagency
working group to handle coordination issues likely
to arise with disclosure of third agency
documents.
4. Will cooperate with any request by the Board
for additional material that has a reasonable
relationship to the assassination.
5. Would hope that the Board will consult with
DCI before using subpoena power to compel
production of material that involves sensitive
intelligence sources and methods.
5. Exemptions need to be clarified so as to
ensure that deliberative process information and
identities of covert employees are protected.
E. Conclusion: Pledge to cooperate with whatever
mechanism is established to declassify material. Hope that
this effort will help to dispel myths regarding JFK
assassination.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: House Government Operations Committee Hearing on
H.J. Res. 454 (JFK Materials Resolution)
1. On 28 April, the undersigned attended a public
hearing on the proposed Assassination Materials Disclosure
Act conducted by the House Government Operations Legislation
and National Security Subcommittee. Majority
Committee/Subcommittee Chairman Conyers and Ranking Minority
Member Horton were present for the entire hearing; majority
Subcommittee members English, Neal, Peterson, and Thornton
and minority members Shays and Schiff and full Committee
member Martinez attended at least part of the hearing. The
Committee's Press release, which criticizes the government
and particularly CIA as releasing JFK-related documents "at
a snail's pace", and witness statements are attached.
2. The hearing was well attended by the public and
attracted much media coverage. Eight witnesses testified in
four groups: Congressmen Louis Stokes (assisted by
Robert Blakey, former counsel to the House Select Committee
on Assassinations) and former HPSCI Chairman Lee Hamilton
testified first. The congressmen were followed by the movie
"JFK"'s director Oliver Stone, who was followed by
Howard Willens, Counsel to the Warren Commission, and
James Johnston, Counsel to the Church Committee. The
session closed with a panel comprised of Ms. Leslie Harris,
Chief Legislative Counsel for the Washington office of the
ACLU; Dr. Herbert Parmet, Professor of History,
Queensborough Community College and Graduate School of the
City University of New York, and Dr. Harold Rellyea,
American National Government Specialist at the Congressional
Research Service.
3. Chairman Conyers advised in his opening remarks
that the Committee wanted to hear from the Executive branch
and thus would hold another hearing session. He noted that
"after much negotiation," the Director of Central
Intelligence would be testifying in mid-May. He further
noted that the Committee also hoped to hear from the
Attorney General, but negotiations with the Justice
Department were still ongoing. Conyers was criticized of
the DoJ at the outset, noting that the Committee had
ADMINISTRATIVE INTERNAL USE ONLY

ADMINISTRATIVE INTERNAL USE ONLY
Subject: House Government Operations Committee Hearing on
H.J. Res. 454 (JFK Materials Resolution)
received a long, single-spaced letter from Justice detailing
numerous "legalistic" objections to the resolution, which he
characterized as not reflecting a real willingness to work
together to release the documents to the American people.
4. The general tone of the session was strongly in
favor of the resolution and disclosure of the vast majority
of the material. Most witnesses conceded that there might
be some materials that required postponement of disclosure,
but the bias was clearly toward disclosure. Even
Oliver Stone, in response to a comment from Congressman
Shays that he (Shays) found it hard to imagine what national
security or privacy issues would persist after 30 years,
conceded that there might be some exceptions, but Stone
thought 98 percent of the material could be released.
Several witnesses, including Congressman Stokes and Church
Committee counsel, suggested that most national security
information should be released under the resolution, but
that privacy interests posed greater concerns.
Congressman Hamilton warned that the Congress should be
careful that nondisclosure "loopholes" do not "swallow up
the bill," which is why he said that review by an
independent board was so important.
5. Stone's testimony had quite an impact on the
hearing. Several congressman and witnesses credited his
movie "JFK" as "the reason we are all here today."
Chairman Conyers appeared particularly impressed with Stone,
describing his testimony in exchanges with later witnesses
as "persuasive" and "compelling." A few potentially tough
questions were thrown at Stone--did he not over-lionize
Garrison; how much research did he do for the movie and did
he seek to talk to or obtain information from the government
as part of his research process? However, there was no
aggressive follow-up to Stone's answers. Discerning
observers may have picked up on the fact that Stone's
"research" seemed tailored to and limited by pre-conceived
conspiracy theories. (For example, when asked if he had
talked to President Ford, a member of the Warren Commission
and advocate of disclosure of the JFK documents, Stone
answered no--that it was pretty obvious where Ford stood as
a proponent of the lone gunman theory.)
6. When asked about his personal views, Stone said he
believed that there were two conspiracies. The murder
conspiracy was small and covert--perhaps involving no more
that five to ten people--and was led by the "intelligence
agencies." Stone did not mention CIA by name at this point.

Subject: House Government Operations Committee Hearing on
H.J. Res. 454 (JFK Materials Resolution)
He mentioned Oswald's alleged ties to naval intelligence,
and also said that a closer look should be taken at an
operation "MONGOOSE" and a Colonel Landsdale. He also
posited a bigger "cover-up" conspiracy after the fact,
spearheaded by President Johnson (who Stone alleged told
Earl Warren he would be responsible for World War III if the
Commission tied the Cubans into a conspiracy). Stone
theorized that a much broader "Establishment", while not
directly involved in the assassination, was not sorry to see
Kennedy go because he was an agent of profound change
embarking upon several courses that disturbed that
"Establishment", including pulling out of Vietnam. In
response to a later question about various theories, Stone
called the Mafia theory a "red-herring." Stone said "as you
know, the CIA has always used the Mafia for plausible
deniability" and that it was important to look behind the
Mafia at "who pulls the strings."
7. Other matters of Agency interest discussed include
that both the Warren Commission attorney and particularly
the Church Committee attorney castigated CIA for "lying" to
the Warren Commission. The particular example offered had
to do with "AMLASH." This individual came up in connection
with traces the Agency apparently conducted for the Warren
Commission. CIA purportedly had a relationship with AMLASH
in connection with a Castro assassination plot, but did not
make this fact known to the Warren Commission. The
witnesses characterized this as pertinent information CIA
consciously withheld from the Warren Commission. Also, when
the final panel engaged in a broader discussion of
government disclosure and FOIA with the subcommittee, the
ACLU held up the CIA Openness Task Force report as an
example of why FOIA was a "dismal failure" as the mechanism
to "vindicate t public's right to know." (On 18 March
Conyers rigorously questioned Gary Foster on the task force
report when his subcommittee held a hearing on "Government
Secrecy After the Cold War.")
8. A major recurring theme was concern that, despite
the need to make the documents publicly available, the
Administration would not support the resolution and it could
be vetoed. Congressman Hamilton stated that, if the
resolution were vetoed, he hoped that at minimum the House
would pass a resolution to release its own records. (Such
an action would be problematic for the Administration,
because much Executive branch information is contained in
House records, and the House also probably considers
documents obtained from Executive agencies as part of its

records.) Most witnesses thought the Congress should try to
avoid a constitutional confrontation with the
Administration, however, and a few practical suggestions to
help work around problems were made. For example, the ACLU
suggested that the Review Board might be modeled after the
Advisory Committee established in connection with the State
Department's preparation of the Foreign Relations of the
United States (FRUS) series, with which CIA's historical
staff is familiar. This body was established by a provision
included in last year's Foreign Relations Authorization Act.
9. In conclusion, the hearing did not get into much
detail on provisions of the resolution. Much time was spent
on general propositions like the fact that the documents
ought to be released and why, and matters tangential to core
issues raised by H.R. 454.

STATEMENT OF ROBERT M. GATES
DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE
BEFORE THE
COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS
UNITED STATES SENATE
12 MAY 1992
13-00000
Mr. Chairman, I am here today at your request to provide
my views on Senate Joint Resolution 282, "The Assassination
Materials Disclosure Act of 1992," and to describe the nature of
documents held by the CIA that relate to the assassination of John
F. Kennedy. I very much appreciate the opportunity to speak on
this important matter.
Let me begin by stating that I am in complete agreement
with the purpose underlying the joint resolution--that efforts
should be made to declassify and make available to the public as
quickly as possible government documents relating to the
assassination of John F. Kennedy. We hope that opening up and
giving journalists, historians and, most importantly, the public
access to governmental files will help to resolve questions that
still linger even 28 years after the assassination. Further, I believe
that maximum disclosure will discredit the theory that the CIA had
participated in the murder of John F. Kennedy.
Even before introduction of this joint resolution, I
recognized the need for greater public access to CIA documents
of historical importance. Two months ago, I announced the
establishment of a new unit within CIA that will be responsible
for declassifying as many historical documents as possible
consistent with the protection of intelligence sources and
13-00000
methods. This new unit, the Historical Review Group, in the
Agency's Center for the Study of Intelligence, will review for
declassification documents 30 years old or older, and national
intelligence estimates on the former Soviet Union that are
10 years old
