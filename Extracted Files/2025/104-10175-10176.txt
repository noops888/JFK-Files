SUBJECTO Lyle STUART
Reference is made to your memorandus dated 1 June 1964,
in which you provided this office with several questions you
wished to have passed to Hiss Viola June COBB regarding
Lyle STUART. There follows the information provided by
Do your inquiry:
1. Regarding Lyle STUART, Juan Jose AREVALO, and
Antikomunismo en Agorica Latina:
Early in the spring of 1962, in Mexico, AREVALO told
me that STUART was prodding him about getting another of his
books translated, to take advantage of the publicity around
The Shark and the Sardines. I was already far beyond
speaking terms with SI ALT and therefore declined to have
aaything further to do with him. About three months later,
AREVALO told me that STUART was going to publish
Antikomunismo en America Latins and that a young American
student, married to a Hexican, Angela delli SANTE ARROCHA
(who had written Arevalo, pensador contemporanco, published
by Coste Amic, 1962, financed by Als Badical Revolucionario
de El Salvador) was doing the translation into English.
Early in 1963, AREVALO told me that the translation hadn't
been satisfactory and therefore STUART had obtained a re-
translation, by Charleton DEALS.
When STUART was here in Mexico in June, he told
Dr. OSTGUEDA that he was very happy about the way the book
was selling.
:
Inasmuch as STUART has paid AREVALO only 10 per cent
of moneys received by STUART on the Shark and the Sardinen
zales (in contrast with some book contracts in which the author
receives 10 per cent of the money represented by number of
copies sold multiplied by the retail sales price) I would
assume he is no more generous with Antikomunismo.

I know of no affiliations of STCART with foreign
political parties of government. His attempts to get close
to Fidel CASTRO in 1960 were motivated by a desire to exploit
the journalistic advantages of an interview. His original
interest in The Shark and the Sardines was apparently
motivated by money-making interests and by the hope that
he night spark a sensation - exactly what he did manage to
do with his outrageous advertising. He seemed to calculate
that there might be libel suits possible against the firas
and the newspapers he could provoke to attack him.
The original contract of AREVALO with STUART was
superseded by another in November of 1961, granting STUART
certain rights with regard to other foreign language editions
of The Shark and the Sardines and, I believe, establishing
hold hero firat antion on other ARKVALO books
translated into English.
Information about STUART's dealings with AREVALO
and whatever others, could be obtained (with cutie) from
Eileen BRANT, who was his editor at the time of the firet
contact with AREVALO. She subsequently broke with him
because of deep and bitter resentment against him, then
returned not too long ago to collaborate with him.
his wife's sister.
She is
She is certainly working with him nov
only because he finally offered her a little better pay. For
her to have changed her mind about him would be alnost
inpossible, I believe, in view of the long history of incidents
that had brought her to have contempt for him, at the time
I knew her ia 1961. She knows his operation inside-out.
In order to get information from her, it would be absolutely
necessary to approach her from some angle that would give
no hint of government investigation. She is very gregarious.
She is a fortyish medium-attractive, lonely, New York single
voman (unless her status has changed since I knew her).
contacted by somebody she would assume to be a writer, and
who would be a bit friendly with her and see her off-bours,
she would probably talk freely about STUART. But she is
quite clever and rather worldly in some respects, so that must
be kept in mind in case she is contacted. SHE HAS A VERY
DEEP AND LONGTINE NEGATIVE ATTITUDE TOWARD ALL GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES INVOLVED IN INVESTIGATION. She was active in
liberal activities in Chicago, and if I remember correctly,
although she is certainly not communist, she considered bersed
a little jeopardised by the Ec Carthy period.

2. Regarding Lyle STUART, Dr. Baul CarcUKDA, Bartolome
COSTA Amic, and Mario ΕΟΝΤΣΤΟΡΓΗ Toledo:
Dr. OSEGUEDA apparently has had a secret longing to
get something of his ove printed in English. Ee seized upon
the opportunity of commenting BKALS' introduction to
Antikomunismo in order to write to STUART this spring.
STUART wrote very cordially back to OSEGUEDA, hoping to ment
Lim on a trip to Mexico in June. When OSEGLEDA confessed to
ne his correspondence with STUART, he sought to make me see
it as an attempt to speak with STUART about the royalties
STUART has never paid me.
When Dr. CSEGUEDA finally did see STUART here in
Mexico during the book congress in June, he only very
timidly and very, very briefly touched upon the royalty
wwohlen, and indeed went to a great deal of trouble to serve
STUART by introducing
MONTEFORTE Toledo. (STUART had expressed interest ta
getting in touch with some publishers and writers.) CEZGUEDA
buntled about, taking OSEGUEDA and MONTEFORTE Toledo to lunch
with STUART, even managed to get the MONTEFORTE Toledos to
invite STUART to dinner at their apartment. There were
tentative discussions of collaborating in the distribution of
COSTA Amic books in the United States and of publishing
come book of MONTEFORTE Toledo's.
However, both COSTA Anic and the MONTEFORTE Toledos
told me that they found STUART offensively vulgar and were not
at ali enthusiastic about having anything to do with hin.
Two weeks ago, OSEGUNDA sketched the outline of a
book (contemporary history of 1.3. and Latin American relations)
he hopes STUART will went to publish, and sent the outline
Pup to him.

LYLE STUART
AREVALO
"ANTIKOMUSISMO EN AMERICA LATINA"
Early in the spring of 1962, here in Mexico, Arévalo told me that Stuart
was prodding him about getting another of his books translated, to take ad-
vantage of the publicity around "The Shark and the Sardines". I was already
far beyond speaking ceras with Stuart and therefore declined to have anything
further to do with hin. About three months later, Arévalo told me that Smart
was going to publien "Antikomunismo en America Latina and that a young American
student, married to a Mexican, Angela delli Sante Arrocha (who had written
"Arevalo, Fensador Contemporaneo"; vas doing the translation into English.
Early in 1963, Arévalo told me that the translation hadn't been satisfactory
and therefore Stuart had obtained a re-translation, by Charleton Beals.
When Stuart was here in Mexico in June, he told Dr. Osequeda that he was
very happy about the wey the bock was selling.
Inasmuch as Stuart has paid Arévalo only 10 percent of moneys received by
Stuart on "The Shark and the Sardines" sales (in contrast with some book con-
tracts in which the author receives 1.0 percent of the money represented by
number of copies sold multiplied by the retail sales price) I would assume he
is no more generous with "Antikomunismo". I can ask Dr. Osegueda the exact
teres, but I haven't been able to see Osegueda this week.
I know of no affiliations of Stuart with foreign political parties of

I am sure you have it on file, but I will enclose a copy of Arevalo's
original contract with Stuart. It was superceded by another in November of
1961, granting Stuart certain rights with regard to other foreign language
editions of "The Shark and the Sardines" and, I believe, establishing that

I have discussed with Paul Burke, DC/CI/ICG, Herco's request for
amendment of OA to use LICOCKY-1 against the Soviet official. We both
are of the opinion that she can be used for development of the target to
determine his susceptibility to recruitment, but that she should not be
used to make the actual recuitment should the matter develop to that
point, due to these considerations: (1) She is not a recruiter, never
has rade a recruitment. (2) Odds are she would be blown to the Soviets,
since we must consider that the odds for successful recruitment of a
Soviet official are not favorable. (3) Eer relationship with LDLUCK
in Mexico is fairly well known, so that there could be an unfavorable
blow back on LINLUCK.
In authorizing her use in the developmental role, Eurke would
like for Station to be informed that it should tell LINLUCK that Sta-
tion's continuing investigation of LICOOEY-L discloses her association
with Soviets; therefore, he should be very careful in his relationship
with her.
