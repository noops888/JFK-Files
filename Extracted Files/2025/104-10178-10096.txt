MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT:
Luis Clements POSADA-Carriles
REFERENCES: a. Memo for Record, 26 June 1967, by LRH,
same subject
b. Williamson/Henze Telephone Conversation,
28 June 1967
1. In my meeting with the Department of Justice today, I
confirmed that POSADA-Carriles was our man. I outlined the pre-
liminary information we had developed on the transactions between
him and one Lefty Rosenthal.
2. Justice was advised that our information disclosed that
POSADA-Carriles had passed silencers and grenades, to Rosenthal
during July 1965, and that in October 1966 he had furnished pencils
and fuses. I also stated that it was our understanding that POSADA-
Carriles was in contact with FDI/Miami and that it had been advised
of these dealings. Justice was told that the items involved were not
of Agency origin. It was emphasized, however, that this was our
preliminary conclusion and that we would undertake to verify it.
3. Justice acknowledged that FBI reporting disclosed
POSADA-Carriles as its contact but apparently the details are some-
what vague. To make a federal case against Rosenthal because of his
suspected involvement in the bombings, it will be necessary to show
that the items used were obtained through interstate commerce. A
preliminary reading suggests prosecution under Title 18 Section 837.
Out of concern for the allegation of entrapment, Justice asked that
hint el ser
yot the sound.
F
we supply answers to the following: (a) did POSADA-Carriles
volunteer himself to the FBI or did it approach him initially;
(b) who informed the FBI of the July 1965 deal - the Agency or
POSADA-Carriles; (c) on what date was this information given;
(d) similarly as regards the October 1966 transaction, the date
the information farnished and by whom; (e) what were POSADA-
Carriles sources for the items or their components; (f) were
these sources within or without the State of Florida? And inci-
dentally were we aware that supposedly POSADA-Carriles realized
a "profit" for furnishing the October 1966 items and that he tried
without success to turn it into the "company"? While I agreed to
undertake to obtain the information requested, I suggested that
much of it might be readily available from the FBI. Justice con-
coded this and intenda to have further discussions with it.
4. Daring the course of the meeting the interesting
hypothesis was suggested to the effect that POSADA-Carriles
might have been "moonlighting" for Rosenthal, and only when he
began to feel the pressure did he start reporting to the Agency and
the FBI.
5. Under strictly controlled conditions with POSADA-
Carriles acting as a conduit, Justice is considering the possibility
of assisting Rosenthal to obtain his needed items, whereupon he
will be arrested immediately for possession. I told them while we
might be willing to have POSADA-Carriles so used we were under-
standably concerned over the adverse comment that our employee's
involvement could generate.
4. On a matter that may be related: one Albert LARRAIN
Maestre is alleged to have admitted to POSADA-Carriles that he has
been involved in the bombings with Rosenthal and to have said more
explosives were needed. LARRAIN Maestre is a fugitive under a
narcotics endictment having formerly resided at 153 East 57th Street,
New York, New York. Do we have any information on this person?

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Luis Clemente POSADA-Carriles
1. The Department of Justice has been investigating
ona Lefty Rosenthal whom they believe to be tied in with key
members of organised crime in the Miami area and who also
they believe has been involved in seven recent bombings in
the Miami arsa. According to the information the Department
has gotten so far, Rosenthal went to a United States citison
named Norman Rothman in the Dominican Republic and through
him directly or indirectly through a person known as Diego,
Rosenthal was put in touch with Luis Clemente Posada-Carriles,
Allen Registration Number A-12419708, 263 S. W. 26th Street,
Miami. Rosenthal understands that Posada-Carriles is attached
te CIA and claims that Posada-Carriles supplied him with caps,
primere and C-4 explosives. Rosenthal is reported so have
offered to talk to Posada-Carriles about the background of the
hombings and who was involved and why, but Posada-Carriles
said he had no interest in the background.
2. Rosenthel is reported to be asking Posada-Corrilee
to supply 240 pounds of C-4 explosives with cape and primers
by Saturday and has told Posada-Carriles that twenty more
bombings are scheduled. The local police are investigaging
the seven bombings whien have taken place and do not know this
other background material.
3. Justice would very much like to have Rosenthal
prosecuted and accordingly would like to have the explosives
dalivered to Rosenthal but to have 99% of it faulty and have the
state prosecuts him on the possession of the 1% of valid
explosives. The Justice Department has a report from the
Bureau's Security Squad reporting to the Bureau's Organised
Crime Division which states that Fosada-Carriles la a CIA
Agent la a GS status.

Importance of XINSEX In Cuban Government
4
During JWAVE debriefing on 11 April 1957, ALRIVER-L provided
the following information of the above subject:
1. As of March 1967, the role of "INCEX in the Cuban
Government, including the Commercial Office in London, was
less important than it had been two years earlier. During
those two years, INCE lost a substancial portion of its
functions and operating elements. Beginning early in 1966,
Cubana de Aviacion rade its own purchases abroad without
the assistance of the "INCEX Commercial Offices. CUBITABACO,
formerly an operating element of INCEX, was abolished late
in 1966 and its functions were taken over by an independent
enterprise called Empresa Cubana del Tabaco with headquarters
in Havana, In Ap
Con, an operating element
of HINCEK, was scheduled to be abolished and replaced by
Instituto del Libro with headquarters in Havana. In January
ana seoruary 1507, the CCC was studying the feasibility of
transferring CUBAZUCAR, an operating element of MINCEX, to
the Sugar Linistry.
SOURCE COLEENT:
:
:
This trend of events appears to indicate.
that in the future WINCEX, functions will,
be further reduced and possibly even
eliminated completely.
