Sthe Director of CIA, "Attention: James Angleton." Angleton stated
that the above request was being made with the approval of Allen
Dulles, the Director of CIA. He further indicated that he desired
the above method of designation in connection with correspondence
dealing with Israeli Intelligence matters. With regard to Bureau (S)
reports concerning Israeli matters, Angleton advised that such (5)
material is being retained under his personal supervision and

to disseminate information to him and other agencies, that his

he is involved in several sensitive projects, such as Israeli
Intelligence, and if his identity were known to the other agencies,
the security of CIA operations could be prejudiced.✓
