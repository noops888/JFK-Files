CONTACT REPORT
WUBRINY - General
02
1. WUBRINY/1 called on the sterile line from Washington
at 1430 hours to discuss the subject covered below.
2. Jira Recap: WUBRINY/1 said that he had just heard
from the Mohawk people who will be in New York the week of
20 May and has stated that they are now prepared to go ahead
investing some $30,000 of their own money in a tire recap
plant in Greece. WUBRINY/1 will give us more details as he
has them and feels that Lodi will also come in with some money
and that WUSALINE can also, if this is desired or needed.
3. WUBRINY/4: WUBRINY/1 said that Luis Borne is briefed
him in detail on the difficulties that apparently have built
up regarding WUBRINY/4s suspicions and said that he plans
to have RECKREY devote himself to this matter. WUBRINY/1 said
that if this is as serious as Mr. Browne appears to believe
it may be necessary to isolate him elsewhere in the WUBRINY
interests, such as the partnership, and taper him off for
termination at the end of his six months. WUBRINY/1 suggested
that it might be useful to send him to Greece in conjunction
with the Mohawk tire recap plant.
4. Martinique - Pumices WUBRINY/1 said that all arrango-
ments are now made and this is ready to go forward and that
KUBARK should decide right away the contribution we wished to
be made by RECKREY. I told WUBRINY/1 we would be back on this
early next week, but I felt sure it was as had been earlier
discussed, namely, that we will foot the bill for RECKREY's
time and travel, etc., expenses. Note: I trust Mr. Allen will
give this priority attention when he returns.
5. Haitian Banker - M. CHARLES WUBRINY/1 said that he
had encountered M. Charles at the National Airport in Washington
at 1920 hours just at the time he was reporting in to me at my
home office and said that M. CHARLES was nattily dressed in a
gray silk suit and said that he was on his way to Chicago but
had not said why. M. CHARLES was accompanied by George deMOHREN-
SHILDT. WUBRINY/1 asked M. CHARLES what in the world is going
on now in Haiti and M. CHARLES shrugged and said that he felt
that they would "bring down Papa Doc." No further details were
given and this was apparently a personal opinion rather than
something based on fact or knowledge.
