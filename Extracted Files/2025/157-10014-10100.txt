February 12
A "special" NSC meeting was held on this day.
The only record of this meeting in the NSC
minutes states: "On instructions from the
Executive Secretary no memorandum was written."
(NSC Minutes)
Issues and Questions
Why were no minutes written?
February 17
Special Group approves evaluation of agents
for Cuban sugar mill sabotage. GRAY "discussed
this matter with his associate" (Eisenhower)
and reported two tactical objections.
Does context show that phrase "his
associate" refers to President
EISENHOWER?
(SG Minutes)
March 9
GRAY tells Special Group that any covert action
like sugar mill sabotage should be undertaken
only after overall consideration of "whether
and how the U.S. wishes to move against CASTRO."
(SG Minutes)
:
Did such consideration involve
assassination plotting?
March 14
At an NSC meeting, Allen DULLES "reported that
a plan to affect the situation in Cuba was being
worked on. Admiral BURKE suggested that any
plan for the removal of Cuban leaders should be
a package deal, since many of the leaders around
CASTRO were even worse than CASTRO." (NSC Minutes)
Was this "package deal" the simultaneous
triple assassination plot that was
mentioned on November 3, 1960?
April 7
At a Special Group meeting, after a paper
titled "General Covert Action Plan for Cuba"
was read, there was "a general discussion as
to what would be the effect on the Cuban
scene if FIDEL and RAUL CASTRO and CHE GUEVARA
should disappear simultaneously." (SG Minutes)
"GRAY asked the (Special) Group's views on what
happens after TRUJILLO, specifically how CASTRO
can be kept out of the Dominican Republic."
Acting DCI CABELL recommends U.S. military inter-
vention after TRUJILLO departs. (SG Minutes)
Does this simultaneous disappearance
plan refer to assassination planning?
Is there a connection between this
Special Group discussion and the NSC
discussion on March 14, 1960, re a plan
to remove Cuban leaders?
Did U.S. support TRUJILLO'S opponents out
of a desire to keep CASTRO out of the
Dominican Republic?

NIXON, Allen DULLES reported "TRUJILLO'S position
continued to weaken and was now quite precarious.

DILLON'S comment indicates that the U.S.

or oust TRUJILLO." Under Secretary of State
DILLON said "if TRUJILLO could be removed from
power in the Dominican Republic while pro-CASTRO
elements were prevented from seizing power
in that country, our anti-CASTRO campaign
throughout Latin America would receive a
great boost. The Vice President agreed that
getting rid of TRUJILLO would be a favorable
development for us. (NSC Minutes)
11
Allen DULLES predicted at an NSC meeting, that
one possible outcome with respect to CASTRO
was an assassination that would make CASTRO
a martyr. (NSC Minutes)
GRAY says "the U.S. has taken publicly about
all that it can afford to take from the
CASTRO government." (SG Minutes)
Memo from the Chief of CIA's Western Hemis-
phere Division to the Acting DCI recommending
delivery of high-powered rifles with telescopic
scopes to the opponents of TRUJILLO. The
memo said: "approval for delivery of these
arms has been given by ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF
STATE ROY RUBOTTOM."
President EISENHOWER met with Secretary of
State HERTER and others to discuss the
Dominican Republic. "The President thought
we should knock out of any documents on file
any reference to starting a revolution."
(Conference Memorandum)
What did NIXON mean by "getting TRUJILLO"?>
Does this show that assassination was not
a favored alternative because it would
produce martyrdom?
General atmosphere of vehement opposition
to CASTRO.
Was the Special Group aware of this action
Was the President aware of the plan?
Purpose of weapons?

Issues and Questions
July 7
Allen DULLES reported to the NSC that the
Venezuelan government wants the United States
to lead the way in breaking relations with
TRUJILLO. DULLES stated: The Venezuelan
government was engaged in an all-out effort,
through the OAS and otherwise, to isolate,
condemn and cause the downfall of TRUJILLO.

TRUJILLO was responsible for the assassination
attempt on BETANCOURT (President of Venezuela)

be made momentarily and therefore it (his
government] wants a showdown without delay."
(NSC Minutes)
"Mr. DULLES stated that he believes, and the
intelligence community agrees, that the
problem of TRUJILLO must be settled_before the
problem of CASTRO can be dealt with, even
though CASTRO is the greater threat."
(NSC Minutes)
The NSC Minutes further state that BETANCOURT
was told that the U.S. cannot act without
ascertaining TRUJILLO'S successor. The U.S.
will work with BETANCOURT and FIGUERES of
Costa Rica on suggestions for a successor to
TRUJILLO. President EISENHOWER suggested that
a government in exile should be ready to go
into the Dominican Republic in the event of
TRUJILLO'S downfall. (NSC Minutes)
GRAY said "his associates" would favor the
development of sabotage operations in CUBA.
(SG Minutes)
Did the U.S. determine a successor?
Did the U.S. "act"?
"Associate" is the euphemism for Eisen-
hower.
Does sabotage imply the further steps
of assassination?

President EISENHOWER stated at an NSC meeting:
"Until TRUJILLO is eliminated, we cannot get
our Latin American friends to reach a proper
level of indignation in dealing with CASTRO."
In this regard, "the President said if we
attempted to take any action with respect to
Cuba before settling the TRUJILLO situation,
we would be the loser." (NSC Minutes)

Dr. Edward GUNN (CIA Office of Medical
Services) receives box of Cuban cigars to
be treated with lethal poison for use against

After the Special Group approved anti-LUMUMBA
operations in the Congo, "GRAY commented,
however, that his associates had expressed
extremely strong feelings on the necessity for
very straightforward action in this situation,
and he wondered whether the plans as outlined
would be sufficient to accomplish this
It
was finally agreed that planning for the Congo
would not necessarily rule out 'consideration'
of any particular kind of activity which
might contribute to getting rid of LUMUMBA."
(SG Minutes; emphasis added)
Were EISENHOWER, GRAY, or DCI DULLES
aware of this?
Is this circumlocutious order for
assassination from the President? An
indication that at the least, assassina-
tion was within the range of acceptable
means for getting rid of LUMUMBA"?
At the NSC meeting, Mr. STANS suggested that
the U.S. might "throw out LUMUMBA by peaceful

Did the NSC contemplate "disposing of"
LUMUMBA by assassination?

Allen DULLES stated at an NSC meeting that
"LUMUMBA was not disposed of and remained a

(NSC Minutes)
October 24
At an NSC meeting, Allen DULLES reported
that "five Congolese soldiers had attempted
to assassinate MOBUTO on the 15th of
October. The U.S. had prior information
of this attempt and had warned MOBUTO
(NSC Minutes)
November 3
Did. this information prompt the U.S.
to plot the assassination of LUMUMBA
in retaliation or to protect MOBUTO?
At a Special Group meeting, Mr. MERCHANT
"asked whether any real planning has been done
in taking direct positive action against FIDEL,
RAUL and CHE GUEVARA. He said that without
these three the Cuban government would be
leaderless and probably brainless. He conceded
that it would be necessary to act against all
three simultaneously."
The minutes further state: "General CABELL
pointed out that action of this kind is
uncertain of results and highly dangerous
in conception and execution, because the
instruments must be Cuban. He felt that,
particularly because of the necessity of
simultaneous action, it would have to be
concluded that Mr. MERCHANT'S suggestion is
beyond our capabilities." (SG Minutes)
Was MERCHANT referring to an assassina-
tion of Cuban leaders?
Shortly before this, CIA had made the
assassination contract with the Mafia.
Was General CABELL unaware of this CIA
contract? Was General CABELL expressing
a traditional CIA objection to assassina-
tion proposals? If so, on what other
occasion did Mr. GRAY hear the CIA
objection?

At a Special Group meeting, Mr. BISSELL gave
the broad outlines of a two-pronged plan
for proceeding with certain limited covent
activities directed against the TRUJILLO
regime, but "he also emphasized that the
proposed actions would not of themselves
bring about the desired result in the near
future, lacking some decisive stroke against
TRUJILLO himself." (SG Minutes) (Source:

GORDON GRAY: Short Summary
Gordon Gray was Special Assistant to the President for National Security
Affairs from 1958-1961. During this period Gray represented President
EISENHOWER at Special Group meetings at which the following subjects
were discussed: "any particular kind of activity which might contribute
to getting rid of LUMUMBA"; provision of small arms to opponents to
TRUJILLO in the Dominican Republic; and detailed planning for "how the
U. S. wishes to move against CASTRO"..
Gray's testimony should involve the following questions (see attached
list of exhibits):
CASTRO
1. What was Admiral Burke referring to at the March 14, 1960, NSC meet-
ing when he spoke of "a plan for the removal of Cuban leaders should
be a package deal"? (Exhibit at Tab E)
2. Is there a connection between the plan referred to by Admiral Burke
at the March 14 NSC meeting and the discussion at the March 14
Special Group meeting on the "effect on the Cuban scene if Fidel and
Raoul Castro and Che Guevara should disappear simultaneously"?
(Exhibit at Tab F)
3. Were President Eisenhower or Mr. Gray aware that on August 16, 1960,
the CIA Office of Medical Services received a box of Cuban cigars to
be treated with poison for use against Castro? (Exhibit at Tab 0)
4. Were President Eisenhower or Mr. Gray aware that in August 1960
Bissell asked Edwards to find underworld contacts with Cuba for an
assassination mission? (Exhibit at Tab R)
5. At the November 3, 1960, Special Group meeting, was Mr. Merchant
referring to planning for assassination when he asked whether plan-
ning had been done "in taking direct positive action against Fidel,
Raoul, and Che Guevara"? How does General Cabell's response (that
Merchant's suggestion "is beyond our capabilities") square with the
fact that shortly before November 1960 the CIA had made contact with
the Mafia for a Castro assassination effort? (Exhibit at Tab V)
TRUJILLO
1. Was Vice President Nixon referring to assassination at the April 14,
1960, NSC meeting when he said "getting rid of Trujillo would be a
favorable development"? (Exhibit at Tab H)
NW 50955 DocId: 32423488 Page 15

2. Was the Special Group, Mr. Gray, or President Eisenhower aware that
Assistant Secretary of State Rubottom was reported, on July 1, 1960,
by the CIA Western Hemisphere Division Chief to have approved delivery
of high-powered rifles with telescopic sights to Trujillo opponents?
(Exhibit at Tab YZ)
3. When President Eisenhower was reported at the July 28, 1960, NSC meet-
ing to have said that "until Trujillo is eliminated
.", was he
referring to an assassination? (Exhibit at Tab M)
4. On January 12, 1961, the Special Group approved making available
"small arms" to dissidents in the Dominican Republic. Were these
assassination-type weapons such as the rifles with telescopic sights
referred to in Exhibit at Tab YZ? (Exhibit at Tab X re January 12
meeting)
5. Did the attempts by Trujillo to assassinate President Betancourt of
Venezuela prompt the Special Group to favor supplying arms to Dominican
dissidents who might try to assassinate Trujillo? (Exhibit at Tab K)
LUMUMBA
1. When Mr. Gray commented at the August 25, 1960, Special Group meeting
that "his associates had expressed extremely strong feelings on the
necessity for very straight-forward action", was he referring to
assassination? Do Mr. Dulles' reservations indicate that he was
objecting to a suggested assassination? (Exhibit at Tab P)
2. When Mr. Gray said at the Special Group meeting on September 8, 1960,
that "he hoped that agency people in the field are fully aware of the
top level feeling in Washington that vigorous action would not be
amiss", was he referring to assassination of Lumumba? (Exhibit at
Tab S)

GORDON GRAY: SHORT SUMMARY
Gordon Gray was Special Assistant to the President for Natonal Security
Affairs from 1958-61. During this period Gray represented President EISENHOWER
at Special Group meetings at which the following subjects were discussed:
"any particular kind of activity which might contribute to getting rid of
LUMUMBA;" provision of small arms to opponents of TRUJILLO in the Dominican
Republic; and detailed planning for "how the U.S. wishes to move against CASTRO"
Gray's testimony should involve the following questions:
Did any of the Special Group meetings implicitly or
explicitly contemplate or plan assassination attempts
against LUMUMBA, TRUJILLO, or CASTRO?
To what extent were CIA plans against these leaders
authorized by or made known to President EISENHOWER,
Gordon GRAY, DCI Allen DULLES, or the Special Group as a whole?
What were the general command & control practices?
Questioning of Gray should focus upon the following documents:
Special Group Minutes, November 3, 1960.
Special Group Minutes, August 25, 1960.
Memorandum of July 1, 1960 from J. C. King, Chief, Western Hemisphere

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Minutes of Special Group Meeting, 3 November 1960
PRESENT: Messrs. Merchant, Douglas, Gray, Gen. Cabell,
Gen. Lansdale
1. Cuba
Mr. Gray inquired once more as to the status of planning for
problems which would arise post-Castro. Mr. Merchant said he
would check into the progress of the State Department group which
has been charged with developing recommendations on this matter.
From this the Group launched into a far-ranging discussion of
the entire concept of U.S. efforts against Castro. Mr. Douglas,
supported by Mr. Gray and Mr. Merchant, expounded the idea that
perhaps things have now progressed to a point where covert activities
of the type originally envisaged for CIA to undertake will not be effective.
Mr. Douglas referred to the extensive program of the militia, Mr. Gray
cited the matter of arms from the Soviet bloc, and Mr. Merchant dwelt
on the increasing effectiveness of Castro's measures to control the
population in ways which the Communists have developed so well. The
latter said that he and others in the State Department had originally
thought that a popular rebellion would develop within Cuba and that
this could be augmented by the comparatively small-scale efforts of
exiles under CIA control. Now the same people are beginning to feel
more and more that despite the numerous defections and the economic
deprivations being experienced by the middle and upper classes, time
is actually working on Castro's side. Mr. Merchant said that he
foresaw that there would occur a point in time beyond which covert
intervention would not do the job.
Mr. Gray expressed the opinion that we will never be able to
"clean up" the situation without the use of overt U.S. military force.
He suggested the possibility of using the CIA-backed exiles to mount a
simulated attack on Guantanamo in order to offer an excuse for overt

intervention. This led to an involved discussion, the general conclusion
of which was that such action on our part would not be desirable, but
that should Castro be foolish enough actually to attack Guantanamo
this would almost certainly mean war. Mr. Gray said that he had had
the subject of Cuba inscribed on the NSC agenda for next Monday in
order to be able to arrive at a top-level decision on this very point.
He thought it essential that the policy of the U.S. should be completely
understood by responsible officials, so that any overt Cuban act
