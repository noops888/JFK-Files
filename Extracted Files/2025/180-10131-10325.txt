Mr. Goldsmith. Mr. Tovar, my name is Michael Goldsmith,
Senator Staff Counsel of the Select Committee on Assassinations.
I have been designated by the Committee to take your deposition
today. You are here voluntarily today?

Mr. Goldsmith. You have the right to have counsel present.
Do you waive that right?

The Committee rules provide for the tran-

script of a deposition to be made available to a witness and
actually be delivered for Detention by any witness that gives
the Committee a statement. However, by virtue of the arrange-
ment that the Committee has worked out with the CIA, the Agency
has asked us to request Agency employees testifying before us
to waive the right actually to receive a copy of the transcript.
NW 48331 DocId: 32277210 Page 4

3
The reason for that is because the transcript frequently
2

will contain classified information and the Agency prefers for
that information to be kept in our secure area here. So I
4
would like to ask you to waive your right to receive a copy of

your statement but in so doing, I want to assure you that you
will be given a right to review the transcript for accuracy,

Mr. Tovar. I agree.
Mr. Goldsmith. I would like to inform you that the court
reporter will provide you with a transcript and the transcript
will be certified by the reporter as a complete, accurate and
true record of all the testimony that you give here today.
Now, you are employed by the CIA, is that correct?
Mr. Tovar. Yes.
Mr. Goldsmith. I had given you earlier a copy of a letter
dated 23 March 1978 from Mr. Carlucci to the Chairman of this
Have you had a chance to read that letter?
19
Mr. Tovar. I have.
20
Mr. Goldsmith. Do you understand it?

Mr. Tovar. I understand it.
22
Mr. Goldsmith. Then I think we are ready to proceed to
23
the substance of the questioning. What is your present position
24
with the CIA?
25.
Mr. Tovar. I am the Chief of the Counterintelligence

Mr. Goldsmith.

Mr. Tovar. Ever since a year ago April.

Mr. Goldsmith.
How long have you been working with the

Agency?

Mr. Tovar. Thirty years.

Mr. Goldsmith.
What was your assignement prior to becom-

ing Chief of the CI Staff?
..
10
Mr. Tovar. I was recently returned from overseas where I
11

was Station Chief in Bangkok and three years before that,
Chief of the Station in Laos.

myself a counterintelligence expert.
Mr. Goldsmith. During the years 1959 to '63 what position
did you occupy with the Agency?
Mr. Tovar. In 1959 I was Chief of Station in Kuala
Lumpur in Malaysia.
In 1920, I came back and I was originally Deputy Chief and
then Chief of the Branch ir. Far East Division which controls
operations in the Phillipires, Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia,

Mr. Goldsmith. Have you had a chance to review CIA
document number 1817 and the pages that follow it?
Mr. Tovar. Yes, I have read these. I had not read these.
They were released by one of my subordinates, Mr. Friedlander.
\
Mr. Goldsmith. Are you telling us that today is the first
chance you had to read them?
:
Mr. Tovar. I did not read them this time. They went to
you, to the Committee but I have since read them.
Mr. Goldsmith. They were prepared by whom?
Mr. Tovar. Jack Friedlander, Chief of Operations.
7
They
were signed by him, not prepared by him. They would have been
originated probably by Mr. Kowalski or Mr. Bradley, I am not
sure which. I think Kowalski almost certainly.
Mr. Goldsmith. The memorandum which is labeled CIA No.
1817 was a response by the Agency to an inquiry by the
Committee as to whether it was standard operating procedure for
the Agency to debrief what in effect were repatriated defectors.
I believe it is fair to say by way of summary that the memo
says that it was not in fact standard operating procedure
during the years 1959 to '63 to debrief such individuals. Is
that correct?

Mr. Tovar.
Insofar as I understand it. My knowledge is

limited to what I see here before me in the paper. During this
25
period in question I was not involved, so I didn't know what

the current policy was then.
2
What I have been told since by those who should know is
3
that there was no policy as set forth here.
4
5
Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know what the criteria were for
selecting the 117 individuals whose files were reviewed?
6
6
Mr. Tovar. No. I think someone mentioned the other day
that the names were incorporated in a memorandum I think ori-
ginionally by the FBI but would not certify to that.

Mr. Tovar, since you have no direct
knowledge as to the manner in which this memo was prepared and,
for example, you don't know the criteria that was used for
choosing these 117 people, I am not going to ask you questions
pertaining to that document. I would like to request that you
communicate with the Office of Legislative Counsel at the
Agency and tell them the individual who was involved in the
actual direct preparation of the document so that I could spend
some time with him.
Mr. Tovar. The document, of course, is over my signature,
so I stand behind the document. I am responsible for what
was said there. If it is_ncorrect then I am incorrect in
leeting that document out. I have no personal first hand know-
ledge of the research he did to arrive at the conclusion here

CIA no. 1818 indicates that CI Staff has completed a
review of the files of 117 US persons who had "defected" to
the USSR between 1959 and 63 and since returned to the United
States. Is that correct? '58 to '63?
Mr. Tovar. Yes.
Mr. Goldsmith. I would like you to review the statement
under the name Thomas Morrdian. M-O-R-R-I-D-I-A-N. While you
read that paragraph, I wil.. state for the record thst the way
the memo is set forth it indicates that it was not standard
operating procedure to debrief such individuals, that of 117
people whose files were reviewed only ten were debriefed.
12 Then it proceeds to list the ten individuals who in fact were
debriefed.
13
14
I have now requested lir. Tovar to read the first summary
which is right next to the name of the first person who was
debriefed.
15
16
17
Mr. Tovar. Yes sir.
la
Mr.
Goldsmith. When did that individual defect?
19
20
Mr. Tovar. 1947 is the year he went to the USSR.
assume that is the year he defected, if that is the term.
I
21
Mr. Goldsmith. So that in fact that individual was not
22
someone who defected between 1958 and 1963?
23
Mr. Tovar. That is correct.
24
Mr. Goldsmith.
Let us look at the next individual under
25
B, Joseph Marshall.

Mr. Goldsmith. When did Mr. Marshall defect?
Mr. Tovar. It is not clear. He was born in the US in
1897. He said he was employed in Hawaii in 1921. There is no
indication whence he went 1:0 the USSR.
Mr. Goldsmith. Theres no indication he defected between
'58 and '63?
Mr. Tovar. No. He was arrested by the Soviets in 1945.
Conceivably he might have defected after that.
Mr. Goldsmith. The letter "C", Tommaro S-G-O-V-I-O.
Would you please read that section and tell us when this indi-
vidual defected?
13
Mr. Tovar.
Again, he went to the USSR with his parents
14
15
in the 1930s. No indication when he defected. He left the
USSR in 1960. No way of telling.
16
17
Mr. Goldsmith. This individual did not defect between
58 and '63?
13
Mr. Tovar. At last we have no indication he did. One
19
would assume to the contrary.
Mr. Goldsmith.
20
Letter "D", Mary Mackler, will you please
21
read the first summary and tell us when she defected?
22
23
24
25
Mr. Tovar. There is ro indication when she defected.
She went to the USSR with her parents in 1931. Sometime after,
married a Soviet.
Mr. Goldsmith. Again, no indication she defected between

'58 and '63?
2

4
Mr. Tovar. No.
Mr. Goldsmith. Would you look at letter "E". Sonia and
Fred A-S-I-N-I-A-N. When did they defect?
Mr. Tovar. They renounced their US citizenship in 1948.
5
6
So I assume that is the operative year.

Mr. Goldsmith. Will you look at the letter "F" now?
Mr. Tovar. Jack Kuralski.
Mr. Goldsmith. When did he defect?
Mr. Tovar. He recounced his US citizenship in 34 and
departed USSR I assume in 1934.
Mr. Goldsmith. The point I am trying to make is that the
memo responding to the Committee's inquiry makes reference to
ten individuals who defected between the years '58 and '63.
Itothen proceed to provide us with ten names. But in fact,
15
15
if we continue to look through the list we will see that seven
17
of the ten individuals did not defect during that time period.
la
Some of them did return ducing that time period.
19
Mr. Tovar. And were debriefed.
20
Mr. Goldsmith. And were debriefed.
21
Mr. Tovar. Contacted.
22
Mr. Goldsmith. Of the ten, perhaps three or four returned
23
during the relevant time period. I asked those questions
24
25
mainly to draw your attention to the fact that the response
given was not really
NW 48331 DocId: 32277210 Page 11
TOP SECRET
10
Mr. Tovar. -- precisely what you wanted?
2
Mr. Goldsmith.
3
Yes.
Mr. Tovar. I don't know the answer to that. I would
:
4
5
assume that the criteria they applied here as best they could
was when did he defect, when did he return, was he debriefed
6
7
8
or contacted? In some cases they hit one out of three, in
other cases two out of three. I think they were giving the
best correlation with your criteria that they could.
9
Mr. Goldsmith. I understand that. My point might be then
10
11
that the introductory section should not have stated that these
were people in 1958 and '63 when in fact they were not.
12
Mr. Tovar. You are right. That is an incorrect statement
13
Is your requesting memo here? That is not a very good state-
14
ment.
IS
Mr. Goldsmith.
Here is the letter dated April 6, 1978
16
17
13
which I show you just for your information to show you what the
Committee was requesting from the Agency. If you will look
under number two.
19
20
21
22
23
24
25
Mr. Tovar. Then this would appear to correlate with that.
You asked to indicate whether the AGency from '58 to '63
interviewed or debriefed former American defectors.
time they defected is not the operative consideration.
Mr. Goldsmith. No, it was not.
Mr. Tovar. The time of the debriefing --
Mr. Goldsmith. Yes, that would be the focus.
So, the
NW 48331 DocId: 32277210 Page 12
TOP SECRET
11
Mr. Tovar. So these would be at least consistent with that.
2
Mr. Goldsmith. Yes, that is true. I would like also for
3

purposes of further clarifcation, to have you read the letter
dated May 12, 1978 starting with the second full paragraph.
It is not `numbered.

10
11
Mr. Tovar. Yes.
Mr. Goldsmith. I show you that only for your background
purposes, not to ask you any questions about it. In any event,
I would appreciate having the name of the individual who
prepared the memo passed along to the Office of the Legislative
Counsel.
Mr. Tovar. Yes sir.
12
13
Mr. Goldsmith. The response that was provided to the
14
Committee indicates that the CIA had no standard precedure for
15 debriefing returning US delectors. What was the basis for that
16
policy or actually for the absence of the policy?
17
13
19
Mr. Tovar. I don't know. I can speculate only
having been there and not having any involvement
know what mentality of those in charge was at that time.

I don't
20
21
Mr. Goldsmith. What would your specilation be?
Mr. Tovar. I would speculate that the contact with and
22

24

debriefing, in effect the supervision of Americans in that
category would be FBI's prerogative and the Agency as a rule
would not have had any basc interest or reason to be involvedaj
unless there were a specific counterintelligence concern.
