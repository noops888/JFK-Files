The Honorable J. Walter Yeagley
Assistant Attorney General
Internal Security Division
Deparment of Justice
Washington, D. C. 20530
Dear Walt:
After you informed me on 29 November 1966 of the
Possible indictment by the U. 5. Attorney in Florida of Rolando
Masferrer and others concorsed in the plas to launch an expedition
from Florida against President Duvalier of Haiti, I asked for a
report on our knowledge of, or involvement in, this activity.
As you know, we have installations in the Miami area
which utilize a variety of sensitive covers. The Chief of Station
coordinates his activities closely with the Federal Eurezu of
Investigation, the Immigration and Nateralisation Service, and
the Eurens of Custame of the Department of the Treasury and
disseminatee to those offices in the area pertinent intelligence
Information
Our Stationvas well informed on the plans of MeTOC -
and his coberts and decemianted this information is the normal
manzer. Part of this reporting included informatica that Masierter
and some of his ascecintes repeatedly asserted that thels plotting
had boom approved by the U. S. Government. On some occasions
thay elated this approval came from this Agency, and the other.
timse they intimated that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had
approved their actions. These claims were apparently used to
persuade various perseme, primarily Cuban cailes, seme of whem
formerly had contact with the Agency, to jeta the plet. It appears
logical to assume that Masterrer vonié continue to claim, that be
had received what he interpreted to be U. S. Government approval
ef the schems to overthrow President Devalier, and if he haم

nothing more positive he can take the approach that he considered
the U. S. Goverrunent tacitly approved his plot since it obviously
know about it and did not take any action against him.
For the record, it can be flatly stated that neither by
statement nor by implication has the Central Intelligence Agency
indicated to anyone that it approved or was supporting the plot.
On the contrary, those who queried people they knew were con-
sected with our Agency concerning possible participatics in the
pict were told that it had no U. 8. Government backing whatsoever.
Seme of the plotters attempted to contact this Agency through
various intermediaries, and the intermediaries were told that the
Agency wished to have nothing to do with the undertaking and that
any inferrsation concerning violations of U. S. laws should be
passed to law enforcement agencies, particularly the Bureau of
Custems and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Technically,
therefore, the Agency has stayed clear of the plotters, and we
would be in a position to state that we had no conecties with the
plot and had given it so encouragement or backing of any sort.
As a practical matter, however, if prosecution were
pursued, Masferrer, and perhaps other defendants, would probably
claim that they had CIA backing and some might even believe it to
be true. This might well lead one or more defendants to seek
a subpossa duces tecum for an Agency witness and the Agency
documentaties on the subject. As noted above, the witness can
testify to the fact that the Agency had in no way participated or
encouraged the activity. If it proved impossible to quash the
requirement for production of cocuments, however, we would be
faced with a situation where we would almost certainly have to
claim the documents were privileged sa the grounds of security.
Aside from the sensitivity of the reports and their possible
compremise of sources, we would have the problem of identification
of our personnel under cover and of protecting the sensitive cover
arrangements.
The same is true to a lecser extent of action against
Masferrer la connectics with vicistions of his parols. la view
of the flagrest and numerous violations which were actuzily
knowa to tad reported by Government agencies without any
punitive action recuiting, it would appear that he could make a
plausible cisim that the Government had at least winked at, if

this new status, prompt action could be taken on those circumstances
alone.

MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION between

William G. Bowdler,
SUBJECT:
Lovasion of Haiti
:
Andrew St. George called me from Mami.
He said that he and the CBS film erew, headed by a Mr. McMullin
(phonetic), were back ia Miami to cover the departure this weekend
of the expedition which Rolando Masferrer was organising to lavade
Haiti. St. George claimed that Masferrer had recruited 300 men and
arranged for the use of one B-89, two C-468 and a large boat. He
sold that all the preparations were so much in the open that it was
evident that Masferrer and his Haitian colleagues had received the
"green light". Recent events in Haiti, plus Masferrer's activities.
were attracting a lot of newamen to Miami.
I teld St. George that he was mistaken about the "green light". We
will not telerate vielation of our neutrality laws. Our enforcement
agencies, whose dety it is to enforce these lave, will cot permit
what he described taking pizce. I wanted him and those with whom
he was dealing to be clear on this point. He said he would inform
Mr. MeMallin.

(This report vas developed by a Navy representative assigned to the office of
preparation.)
On 28 Oct 66 I spoke with Rolando Masferrer Rojas, a Ciben exile, and he told
me that he has organized a military force of approximately 250 men to invade
Faiti. The invasion force consists of Caban and Eaitian exiles residing in
the U3, the Bahamas, and the Dominican Republic. The invasion will probably
bo Lunched from the Dominican Republic sometime between 5 and 13 November
and the target is Port-su-Prince. The invasion force vill strike in the
early hours of the morning selected. It is vell arned, and will have air
cover; the presidential palace vill be bombed.
Masferrer stated that Eigene L. Maximilien, Haitian Consil in Miami, Florid,
is aware of the invasion, but he has no knowledge of the invasion date.
Maxinilion is presently in Haiti informing President Dralier that the invasion
ean bo prevented by paying off $200,000 to Kasferrer.allion will return
to the ts on 3 November and he has agreed with Vasferrer that if Duvalier
agrees to the pay-off, Maximilien vill receive $50,000 and Masferrer $150,000。
Masferrer told me that the invasion vill take place in any event and the
$150,000, if received, would be used to further support the invasion.
Masferrer stated that he met within the past 10 days with several dissident
Haitian army officers and be had received their export. De Haitian army
officers told Vasferrer that they would revolt as soon as informed that the
Invasion had commenced. They do not know that the target vill be Port-au-
Princes they believe that it will be in the cap Esities area.
Masferrer stated that he was confident that the invasion will succeed, and if
Fuccessfuli, Father Joan Baptiste Ceorzes vould be appointes provisional
president. Kasferrer stated that Colonel Rene Leon, Estiasile, vill Moule

of information collection. The group has provided useful
reports since 1961.

1. On 27 or 28 April 1966, in New York, Rolando Masferrer Rojas,
former Cuban senator who has been involved in plans for action
against President Francois Duvalier of Haiti, received a letter,
from the Haitian who is heading the operation against Haiti.
The Haitian instructed Masferrer to send a trusted person to
the office of Bill Harris, 7150 N.V. 27th Avenue, hiami, Florida,
to talk with Veraon Johnson, a Negro. The Haitian described✓
Johnson as a trustworthy person who would be in charge of getting
aras. Under no circumstances was Masferrer's enisarry to talk
with anyone else.

4. After writing the letter, the Haitian visited Rolando Masferrer
in New York, brought to him equipment worth $2,000, and told
hin to be patient, for the operation against Haiti would be
accomplished.
8. On 6 May Antonio Rojas Masferrer received a liong-distance tele-
phone call from the haitian, who was in Canada. According to
Rojas, the Haitian had toit him that when Duvalier goes to
Argentina he will not return to Haiti.3 Rojas added that the
United States Government Shows this; that some of the Ton Ton
Macoutes (Duvalier's perschal police) were already giving up
their jobs and others had been killed in the streets. The
United States Government therefore fears that the Communists
nay take over in Haiti.
Rojas said that Rolando Masferrer was worried about the Lapse of time in initiating
the Haitian operation and feared that the plan mingit mewer materialize. kwever,
