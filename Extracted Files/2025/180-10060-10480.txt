AGENCY FILE NUMBER :
December 8, 1995
Status of Document:
Postponed in Part
Number of releases of previously postponed information: 13
Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors
including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the
absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.
Number of Postponements: 5
Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.
Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could
reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of
privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Mr. Alvin B. Lewis, Jr.

Select Committee on Assassinations
Dear Al:
I herewith submit my resignation from the Select
Committee effective May 15, 1977.
I have not lost my convictions about this investigation
which brought me here to work last December. However,
personal and financial obligations have made it necessary
for me to obtain more secure employment.
I wish the Committee all success in the future and
I sincerely hope that it is never again plagued with the
problems it has previously faced.
Sincerely,
Hexise
