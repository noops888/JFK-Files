FRANK- Frank was the hardest working student of the group. He con-
sistently ap led himself to all phases of the aining with equal and
great diligence. However, his practical work, which took him a
great deal of time to perform, was always a little sloppy. When
Frank crimped detonators or threw improvised grenades, he was
very shaky. However, he did not seem at all nervous about working.
with other hazardous material. He asked many pertinent questions
which contributed to the group's training and always answered test
questions correctly and in detail. He was cooperative and reacted
well to correction. Some supervision was required since the staff
instructors were concerned about his nervousness with detonators.
His overall performance was rated as proficient.
