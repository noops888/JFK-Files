Classification of EX 3600
Re your request for "a couple sentences of factual
data as to why this document is classified" here they are:
1.Ex post facto, since I was not associated
with Operation MHCHAOS during its existence, I
offer the following reasonable surmise, As we now know,
I can only
during its ts tenure MHCHAOS was one of the most sensitive
operations conducted under DDP aegis, repeatedly sanctioned
(in writing) by the DCI. The activity was deemed so sensi-
tive that it was controlled by through extremely restricted
handling channels. I think it follows lows logically, at least
whether
in my view, that any
a formal or informal one, would have been classified at
document produced by MHCHAOS,
least SECRET.
2. Does the information in this document warrant
classification today. I think it does, and I believe the
current classification of CONFIDENTIAL is proper. Reading

some of the information on some of these pages was seemingly
acquired_from/through sensitive sources/methods. Also
these pages contain frequent mention of FBI information con
cerning many of the Peace Movement groups/organizations i
cited; FBI reports received by MHCHAOS were invariably
classified, for the most part CONFIDENTIAL
3. What should be the proper FOIA exemption for EX
3600; in my view, (b)(3).
