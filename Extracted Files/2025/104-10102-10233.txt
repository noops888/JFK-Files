Ignacy SACHS, upon his return from India, will not
work in the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but will
be reassigned to the Latin American section of the Polish
Ministry of Foreign Trade. He recently wrote a report on
Latin America based upon material contained in the South
and Central American press. He reportedly had a falling
out with his superiors in the Foreign Ministry, hence the
transfer.
ALBICUSPID from ALBICUSPID-5, 30 May 1961 (ultimate source:

Ignacy SACHS, after a period of disgrace, has a new
job, economic assistant for underdeveloped countries in

Tadeusz SZULC
2nd June, 1961.
صح
11)3(6)
The Station copies of the original reports on SZULC have
been destroyed. I attach, however, a memorandum consisting of
selected entries from his card.
2.
: All the information is from the same source, a Polish emigre
who knew SZULC personally and also had, informants in the Polish Embassy.
3.
There is little doubt that SZULC was pro-communist at the time,
and that he co-operated with Ignacy SACHS, a cousin who was employed
by the Press Section of the Polish Embassy, and provided him with
"information". It would, however, be unwise. to jump to the conclusion
.'
that this collaboration took the form of espionage, since SZULCE does
not seem to have made any secret of the relationship.
:
4.
I can find no evidence that Ignacy SACHS was an intelligence
officer, but he seems to have been an active propagandist. He returned
to Poland in 1954. A report from the same source, dated June 1956,
stated that he then occupied the Brazilian desk at the Polish Institute
for International Affairs.
