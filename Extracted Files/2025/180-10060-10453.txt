Final Determination Notification
AGENCY : HSCA
RECORD NUMBER : 180-10060-10453
RECORD SERIES : STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS
AGENCY FILE NUMBER :
December 8, 1995
Status of Document:
Postponed in Part
Number of releases of previously postponed information: 10
Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors
including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the
absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.
Number of Postponements: 4
Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.
Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could
reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of
privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

1977 Inaugural Committe
February 7, 1977
Dear Ms. Johnson:
President Carter and Vice President Mondale have asked us to express
their sincere appreciation to you for your most commendable efforts in
support of the 1977 Inauguration.
The Inauguration of the President of the United States is a moment in
history that serves as a vehicle to communicate to the world the commit-
ment and spirit of the New Administration.
It is with this in mind that I forward this letter to you as a member of
the Inaugural Security and Credential Committee. You displayed the high-
est degree of professionalism and dedication in many important tasks.
You were always willing and ready to work long hours, above and beyond
the normal work day. You volunteered your services for almost anything
asked of you.
Throughout the planning and implementation period, you were faced with
an everchanging list of requirements. Your dedication to duty, under-
standing of the difficulties faced by the Inaugural Committee, and
cooperative attitude are indicative of a true professional. Your over-
all manner of performance was truly outstanding.
If we had the power today, each of you would receive a tangible medal
of citation for the highest award of Volunteer Action. Possessing only
words, we say again, thank you for all the service given so unselfishly.
Sincerely,
Frank ison, Director

hours freely given by volunteers such
as you.
You have helped to set an example of what
we Americans can accomplish by sharing
our talents and energies with each other.
Many thanks.
Sincerely,
