1. RECENTLY CONCLUDED HOS REVIEW OF (ZRPRIMA PROGRAM SHOWS
2
THAT KUDAR EFFORTS HAVE NOT ACHIEVED ANY SIGNIFICANT RESULTS AND
CONTINUATION OF PROGRAM AS SUCH NO LONGER WARRANTED. MAIN REASON
FOR KUBARK FAILURE IS THAT CUBAN TECHNICIAN RECRUITING PROGRAM
2
FIDEL'S
EAS BEEN MISERABLE FAILURE WHEY MEASURED AGAIN/ORIGINAL
OBJECTIVE OF 2000 TECHS FROM WESTERN EUROPE ALONE. THOUGH OUR
FIGURES NOT COMPLETE, WE ESTIMATE PROBABLY LESS THAN FIFTY
CANDIDATES HAVE RECEIVED CONTRACT APPROVAL AND WE ABLE CONFIRM
22
ABOUT TEN WEC HAVE ACTUALLY MADE IT TO THE ISLAND, KUBARK
SUCCEEDED IN INSERTING ABOUT THIRTY RECRUITED TECES INTO THE
VARIOUS BIRING CHANNELS, BUT SO FAR ONLY TWO HAVE RECEIVED CONTRACT
APPROVAL FROM HAVA.
2. CUBAN FAILURE TO RECRUIT IN SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS APPEARS
DUE LARGELY TO RELUCTANCE FOREIGN MINISTEY AND FOREIGN SERVICE
OFFICERS PURSUE TECH RECRUITING MISSION AGGRESSIVELY, BUREAUCRATIC
INCOMPETENCE IN HAVANA, FEAR OF INFILTRATION OF HOSTILE AGENTS

AND PROBABLE LOSS OF INTER ST IN THE PROGRAM ON PART OF CASTRO
HIMSELF. THESE FACTORS WHICH KAEROE FRON OUR STUDY OF THE CUBAN
PERFORMANCE ACCOUNT FOR LACE OF RESPONSE FROM EMBASSIES TO
APPLICATIONS, LOBU DELAY IN GETTING LORD BACK FRON HAVANA AND
SMALL NUMBER OF TECHS ULTIMATELY HIRED, LONG TIME LAG BETWEEN
INITIAL APPLICATION AND ULTIMATE APPROVAL FRON HAVA, WHICH RUNS
SIX TO HINK MONTHS, HAS COST CUBANS NUMBER OF TECHS NHO VERE
INITIALLY EAGER BUT SUBSEQUENTLY LOST INTEREST OR TOOX OTHER
JOBS.

3. IN FACE OF FOREGOING WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT WORTHWHILE
02/1
TO CONTINUE INTENSIVE SEARCH FOR (ZRPRIMA CANDIDATES FOR INSERTION
INTO CUBAN HIRING CHANNEL. /STATIONS WITH ACTIVE LEADS SHOULD STAY
WITH THEM IN THE HOPE THEY MAY STILL BE HIRED, BUT CEASE EFFORTS
TO GENERATE LEADS FROM SCRATCH. ON OTHER HAND, THERE ARE PAIR
NUMBER NON BLOC TECHS IN CUBA AND IT LIKELY CUBANS WILL CONTINUE
TO RIVE NEELS

4. RESPONSE OF MOST STATIONS IN IMPLEMENTING (ZEPRIMA HAS
BEEN MOST GRATIFYING. WE PROVIDED CUBANS WITH GOOD NUMBER HIGHLY
QUALIFIED ENGINEERS AND TECENICIANS WHICH THEY FOR REASONS CITED
UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO ACCEPT. KUBARK HAS MADE A RESPECTABLE
EFFORT TO EXPLOIT THIS OPPORTUNITY AND FACT THAT WE HAVE NOT
ACHIEVED SIGNIFICANT LESULTS IS MARELY REFLECTION CUBAN CONFUSION

AND INEPTITUDE WITH RESULTANT, FAILURE ACHIEVE THEIR OWN GOALS.
