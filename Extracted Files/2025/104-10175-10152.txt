1. Instituto Mexicano de Estudios Sociales, A.C. - This
organization, currently budgeted at $60,000 annually, supports in part this
organization, which also receives funds (some $950,000 yearly)
from HISSS, a German Mahope fund with headquarters in
Aachen, Germany. The objective of this effort is to help establish
a realistic model or prototype Mexican organizations designed to
alleviate and hopefully to advance the social and economic
status of the Mexican campesino.

The executive director of this organization is formerly associated
with the LIEFF project, but he is no longer an
active member of this project which is funded at the current

only agent with access to rightist political organizations.
3. Centro Nacional de Estudios Sociales - The director
of this organization (LISIFER-3) is no longer an active LOFT
agent. The LESINER project was terminated in 1965 and had
been funded at an annual rate of some $65,000. The project
supported a mass media propaganda effort directed at the mid-
dle and lower classes of Mexico and sponsored by a front group
of conservative Mexican businessmen.
4. American Chamber of Commerce of Mexico - The vice
president of this organization is a current Station asset,
LIEFT-1. No money is provided from KOFACE sources to this
organization, although 7-1 receives monthly $300.00. The
duties of this agent do not directly relate to his
