It is my understanding we have no prepared statements to
start with, so I think I'll just open it up to staff questions
and interject some of my own, and I understand that the general
subject matter to be discussed here today and we are interested
in your expertise regarding the question of counterintelligence!
So, we'll just have the staff members start.
Mr. Angleton at least has been before us before, and
routinely we remind all witnesses that they preserve all of
their constitutional rights, including the right to counsel,
the right to remain silent and so forth and so on, and to have
a member of the Committee present during all of the testimony.

Mr. Johnson.
I wonder if we could begin by having both
4

of your gentlemen give us some information on your backgrounds,
beginning with Mr. Angleton.
6
Mr. Angleton. I entered the OSS in 1943 from the Army,
7
8
went into training in Washington and environs and then to
London, and then eventually to Italy, and I took over as
9
Chief, Counterintelligence in Italy, and eventually took over
10 as Chief, OSS.

I returned in about '47, 48, and various jobs in both
espionage and counterintelligence. At one time Chief of
Operations and eventually Chief of Counterintelligence, and
that was from about 1954 until 1974.
Mr. Johnson. Mr. Miler?
Mr. Miler. I entered OSS in 1946. I was sent to China.
I was in China until 1949, transferred to Japan, became involved
in intelligence aspects of the Korean War. I served in Thailand,
the Philippines, as I said, China, Japan, Ethiopia. I traveled
extensively, was a station chief abroad, and for the last ten
years I have been in Counterintelligence, first in the
Special Investigations, and subsequently as Chief of Operations!
for Mr. Angleton's Counterintelligence Staff.
And when I left the Agency in December of '74, that was
my position.

Mr. Johnson. So both of you left the CIA in December, 1974.
Since that time we understand there have been some changes
in how counterintelligence is conducted at the CIA.
Could you give us some understanding of those changes?
Mr. Angleton. I would like to defer to Mr. Miler on this,
5
6
if I may?
7
Mr. Miler. Yes.
8
My understanding is there have been some rather fundamental
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
and substantive changes which are a continuation, actually,
of changes that were made first in 1973, in July of 1973
when many of the centralized counterintelligence functions were
decentralized and reallocated to different components of the
Directorate of Operations. Such things as agent approvals and
security, operational security reviews for intelligence
collection and covert action operations, the oversight on
intelligence operations, and oversight on counterintelligence
17
operations in the field were decentralized.
Research and
18
Analysis has been curtailed, and the emphasis on it has changed
19
20
There have been changes in the record procedures.
Mr. Johnson.
Could you be more specific on these changes,
21
for example, in research?
22
Mr. Miler. In research, the research is now, as I under-
23
stand it, pretty much on a case by case basis, not in an
24
overall perception of worldwide or national counterintelligence
25
problems. There is no

historical problems is not being applied, as I understand it,
2
to current operational efforts or investigative needs. There is
3
an entirely different philosophy being applied as to what may
4
be required in terms of understanding the counterintelligence
6
5 threat to this nation. There is very little emphasis, if any, or
concern with such things as deception and disinformation.
Therd
7

is little application of analytical and assessment work to the
overall role of foreign intelligence and security services in
political action.
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
There have been some fundamental changes in operational
philosophies stemming from an application of what is termed
management by objectives as it is being applied in the CIA to
operations, and there is a has been a distinct change in
some of the attention which has been previously placed on the
problem of penetration from foreign and particularly hostile
intelligence services into the American community.
And there has been a very, very substantivè change in
the perception and the conduct of counterintelligence in that
there has been what is in my view a very serious erosion
17
18
19
20
of security and compartmentation of operations, and leakage
21
22
of information which has not been to the best interests of
a national counterintelligence effort.
23
24
25
Mr. Johnson. So, from going from a rather centralized
apparatus to a decentralized situation, the dangers of penetration
have increased.

Mr. Miler. The dangers of penetration have increased
significantly, and this extends also to the methods by which
3 relations with foreign intelligence services are conducted.
4

8
Mr. Johnson. But how do you respond to the criticism that
during your tenure and Mr. Angleton's tenure, too tight a
rein was kept on counterintelligence information, and individuals
in the field at the station level failed to get the information
they needed to conduct their counterintelligence operation?
9
10
11
12
Mr. Miler. I would have to respond to that, Mr. Johnson,
and I could only respond to it in the context of specifics.
To my knowledge, and as practiced from my position as Chief of
Operations, whenever there was information which was judged

to be of significance, importance to a field station, that
field station was advised, unless there was some overriding
security source protection or other considerations, and the
decision then not to advise them was made at the Deputy
Director for Operations, as it is now called, or the Director
level.
There was, certainly, a very tight security, a very
tight compartmentation of counterintelligence information and
activities, which in my view was essential, and still is
essential, and will be even more essential in the future if
we are to regain a counterintelligence initiative and to do
our job in the future. And I think this is the fundamental
question that the management of the CIA and the Senate and the

Executive have to decide, is do we want a counterintelligence
2
effort, and if so, then we have to get to it, and we have to
3
put our best minds to it.
Mr. Johnson.
4
Were there instances during your period in
5
6
counterintelligence where the Counterintelligence Staff would
conduct its own counterespionage activities, without the knowledge
7
of the various geographic division chiefs?
8
Mr. Miler. There were very few of them, with the chiefs.
9
There may have been some.
10
Mr. Johnson.
In those cases where there were such
11
operations, were they cleared with the DDO?

Mr. Miler. Every single one of them was cleared with the
DDO and/or the Director and/or the Deputy Director.
Mr. Johnson. On important counterespionage operations,
could you tell us in more detail what the approval and clearance
process is?
We know that for covert action the 40 Committee frequently
becomes involved. What about for important counterespionage
operations?
Mr. Miler. Well, Mr. Angleton might want to qualify my
response, because obviously he was involved more in this
than I was, but there would be the two primary considerations.
One was a strictly CIA, counterintelligence or counterespionage
activity. The derivation of the authority for this came from
the statutes which set up the CIA and from National Security

Council directives 53, 55 and so forth. The authority rested

in there. The approval would go to the then DDP, now Deputy
Director for Operations, the Deputy Director and/or the
Director.
4
5
The authorities, if it were a significant counterintelligence
6

or counterespionage case, the authorities, as I understood it
then, might require the Director to go outside the Agency to
the White House or the Attorney General and so forth.

Alternatively, we in the CI Staff might be directed to
coordinate this with the FBI. We would go to the FBI, explain
the case and so forth. The FBI would then go to the Attorney
the Department of Justice and get authorities, whatever
authorities they would require in order to pursue the investi-
gations, conduct the case, and do it according to whatever
stipulations that the Department of Justice would put on it
in order to either neutralize the suspected spy or agent, and/or
conclude the case by prosecution.
17
And I am talking now of primarily in terms of a serious

counterespionage case involving an American citizen.
Mr. Johnson. Mr. Angleton, do you know of any instances
where the CI Staff or higher authority within the CIA went
outside the Agency for approval for important counterespionage
operations?
Mr. Angleton. I know of cases, yes.
And what would the approval system be?

Mr. Angleton.

Well, it would be an ad hoc discussion
between the Director and the Secretary, and probably others,
the Attorney General.
Mr. Johnson. Does this happen frequently? Is this a typical

procedure for a major counter operation?
6
Mr. Angleton.
If it's a major matter, it's on the basis
7
of need to know.

You have another kind of case where a foreigner came to

in such a fashion that there would be no exposure, because of
the political consequences to their government.
C
14
15
I would go to the Director and the Deputy Director, spell
out the matter, and come to a determination with them whether
16
we wanted to take the case on. This particular case involved
17
not only a person who had been in the intelligence service of
18
the opposition a long time, but he had access to codes, and alsd
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
19
a great deal of deciphered material. So it was kicked back
and forth, and there was a determination made that we would
20
21
take it over, the staff would take it over in its entirety.
22
23
And therefore, it meant that I called in Scotty and we
pulled together our team, we sent them abroad. We handled the
24
man in the field for a long time, and then eventually brought
him back here.

In a case of that sort, the instruction was agreed upon
by all concerned, and the Director's instruction was that the
Division was not to be informed, the Division where this
individual came from, the Bloc area, should not be informed;
5

that the Bureau, only two or three people in the Bureau, by
name, should be informed, and that we would run the operation

CIA's responsibility to advise and get the approval of the
Attorney General in bringing someone like this into the
United States.
20
The Director got this approval. It was a formal letter
21
22
23
to the Attorney General, a formal reply. There was a formal
but very limited advice to the Immigration. All of the legal
requirements required by the Attorney General, Immigration,
24
25
all other agencies, were done. However, in this instance, they
were done on a very narrow, select basis, directly to Attorney

With the added fact that we did not disclose
all of the facts, nor identity.
Now, this is important, because the individual was of
such prominence that the country concerned would be placed in
jeopardy diplomatically, the place where he was residing on
tour. There would be intensive investigations by his head-
quarters, and therefore we had to have covers. And so we
laid on in such a fashion that another service received infor-

First of all, by terms of definition, is the phrase or
the term "counterintelligence" interchangeable with counter-

Out of that emerges a product, and one of the products is

How big was the Counterintelligence Staff?
Mr. Angleton. When? Well, when it was in its prime it
was around, it was 200 some odd people. After this decentraliza-

approval, which is approval of agents; we lost our controls
over the Technical Services Division; we lost the geographic
representation; we lost liaison, which was the liaison was with
the FBI and 26 other government agencies who do investigations.
Mr. Miler. They took counterintelligence and liaison
away from the counterintelligence component, if you can imagine
such a situation.
Mr. Angleton. So that reduced us to less than 80 people,
and this comes to, Senator, if I can just point to one of the
most important things in the legislation or in whatever the
Executive does, is that you cannot have in my view a Director
of the FBI and a Director of CIA who are independent of one
another. You have to have some higher authority to whom you
can make an appeal when decisions of this sort are made so that

10 grade counterintelligence until today when there has probably
11 been well, it is least effective.
21
Senator llart of Colorado. Why is that?
Mr. Angleton. Well, I think it has to do with the number
of diversions it had in the days of the Vietnam war, when
internal security lost a tremendous number of men to other
assignments and duties.
Second, I don't think that counterintelligence or the
real thrust of Soviet Bloc intelligence has ever been brought
up to policy level, and, more important, anything that involves
penetration has always been swept under the rug. In other
words, the question of penetration in this government or
penetration in any agency has never been brought to a responsible
level of finding out how it happened and what has gone wrong.

And let's take one defector who said
in this case he
spent 16 years in the Soviet Union in the KGB.
He gave us

over 180 leads of penetration in France, and it occasioned my
2
3
drafting a letter for Mr. McCone to give to President Kennedy
le
le
to give to DeGaul. DeGaul secretly sent to this country one
4
of his highest trusted military men.
He was here incognito.
5 met with the defector for three days.
The French original reaction to President Kennedy's letter
6
7
was, it was Soviet provocation, because this was at the stage
8
when France was making certain very sensitive agreements in the
9
10
11
atomic field and otherwise with the United States, and therefore
these allegations of penetration had a very direct bearing on
those negotiations.
12
15
16
17
13
14
And so the General who came over was
totally prepared to believe this was provocation, but after
three days with the defector, in a meeting with Helms and
myself, he stated without any question that this man was 100
percent bona fide, because he could ask him those questions
right on the nerve of their secrets, and he got the responses.
Now, this defector also gave considerable data on the
18
19
status of penetration in the U.S. Government, documents which
he had seen in Moscow, cryptonyms of operating agents, documents.

which could only have been prepared by our organization, and

23
But in due course Mr. Hoover regarded or made
24
the pronouncement

Senator Hart of Colorado. Why did Hoover make that
decision?
Mr. Angleton. Well, among other things, this defector
wanted to have access to ongoing and to past cases with the
view that he had a tremendous amount of data that he could not
relate to anything, but if he could see things that were going
on, then it would be meaningful to him in terms of what he had
to contribute. And I can take the example that, with another
allied service; immediately we brought them into it and he had
seen certain naval documents that dealt with infrastructure and
budget. This happened to be British.
In time they found the documents, and when they presented
them to him, he could identify those he had seen and those he
vassal
had not seen. This led to the apprehension of Vassil, who

All through the west agents were apprehended on the basis
of his information. But there is a tremendous bulk of it which

is made up of fragments, made up of documents he's seen where
we have not been able to identify the document; a great number
of cryptonyms of reporting sources. where we cannot find the
25
body to fit the cryptonym. So this is the reality. And he is

which were passed to the FBI about penetration which involved

solved only after the FBI officially sent us a letter saying
19
20
that they concluded that there was no substance to this
information.

They had to reopen the investigation

Mr. Angleton.
And they also said:
send it to the Army.
23
Mr. Miler. Yes, send it to the Army.

Now, they had to reopen the investigation when their

surveillance spotted a man coming out of the Soviet embassy, and
Mr. Miler. May I just add two things on this?
First, Mr. Johnson, it goes back to the business of
compartmentation and not advising stations.
Angleton cited, the Paris station of the CIA was not told
anything about the information, and I think this is a very good
example of why you would not.
The second point I would like to follow up on is with
respect to this defector's information, there were five leads

it was subsequently proved that he was a Soviet spy.

Mr. Angleton. Now, that individual had performed four
separate missions for Soviet intelligence since about 1938 or

'39. One, he had been dropped in by the Soviets into Germany
on a mission with the WT set, to be captured in order to be
played back and to penetrate the German intelligence.

Second, he had moved from that into the penetration of

Third, he had penetrated the anti-Soviet forces in Germany
and then he was taken on by us in 1948 or '51 is when they
sent to renew his inks.
So he was with us from '51 to around '60.
Well, when the defection occurred, it was '62.
Mr. Johnson.
15
And Mr. Angleton, you used a term that is
unfamiliar to us:
his inks.
16
Mr. Miler.
Secret inks.
17
18
Mr. Angleton. Secret inks. In other words, the Germans
19
had captured a Soviet agent who had the same kind of
20
inks, and so therefore the inks were compromised, so they laid
21
on a large operation in Berlin and trained him in highly
sophisticated inks. And he is now residing not too far
22
distant from us.
