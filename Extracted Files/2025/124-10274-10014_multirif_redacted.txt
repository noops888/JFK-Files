Reference is made to my memorandum of September 23,
1975, which advised you of a request I received concerning
legal representation for W. Donald Stewart a former Special
Agent of this Bureau who has been requested to submit to an
interview by the Senate Select Committee.
Mr. Stewart telephonically advised on September 24,
1975, that he had been contacted by James Dick of the Senate
Select Committee and again asked to appear for interview con-
cerning mail openings. Mr. Stewart explained to Mr. Dick that
he was arranging with the Department of Justice for legal
representation and until these arrangements were completed, he
did not feel it was appropriate for him to be interviewed. Ac-
cording to Mr. Stewart, Mr. Dick informed him that the Committee
could not wait for such arrangements to be completed and that
arrangements should be made at this time for the interview.
Mr. Stewart stated he would agree to appear for interview
to an interviewer in the immediate future, a subpoena would be
issued. As a result, Mr. Stewart agreed to appear September 26,
1975, for interview by the Senate Select Committee concerning
mail openings. He, however, did not indicate whether he intends
to furnish information at that time.

Mr. Stewart inquired as to the status of his request
for legal representation which he requested by memorandum
September 18, 1975 (a copy was enclosed with memorandum
September 18, 1975). He was advised that this matter had not as yet been
resolved and that he would be expeditiously advised of the
resolution of his request.
In view of the immediate problem concerning legal
representation for Mr. Stewart, it is respectfully requested
that this Bureau be expeditiously advised of your decision in
this matter.

A briefing for Senators Church and Tower has been provided
covering warrantless electronic surveillances, surreptitious entry for
recovery of cryptographic material, teletype coverage requested by the
National Security Agency and electronic penetration of communications
equipment requested by the National Security Agency. The White House
asked that agencies of the intelligence community not respond to any
requests from the SSC covering these matters until the briefing had been
given. The goal of the briefing was to confine knowledge of these matters
to Senators Church and Tower and avoid proliferation of this information
throughout the SSC staff. In view of this, it is recommended that the
enclosed material not be made available to the SSC staff until it is dis-
cussed with the White House. I further urge that it be made clear to the
White House that if this material is to be made available to the SSC that
access to the enclosed material be limited to Senators Church, Tower,
and SSC Staff Director William Miller only.
A copy of the memorandum is enclosed for your records.

UNITED STATES SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH
RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)
Reference is made to SSC letter dated July 7, 1975, with
attached questionnaire. My memorandum dated September 16, 1975,
replies were given to questions 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they pertained to
agencies other than the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). This
response pertains to FBI requests for both telephone and microphone
warrantless electronic surveillances utilized in FBI investigations.
The response excludes from consideration the electronic surveillances
utilized regarding the "Kissinger 17," Joseph Kraft, and Yeoman
Charles Edward Radford. These matters have been the subject of
individual SSC inquiries. The material furnished to the Committee
or to which it has given access in regard to these specific mat-
ters provides the data which would respond to questions 4, 5, 6, 7,
and 8.
Question #4 asked: "What have been the identities of the
agencies and the Presidential appointees who have initiated requests
for warrantless electronic surveillance from 1966 to the present?"
With respect to this question, the FBI has initiated requests
to the Attorney General for warrantless electronic surveillance.
All FBI requests, either initial or continuances, are signed by the
Director or Acting Director of the FBI.
