vho vould know LLANUZA. TONKU affirmed Osiel was previously
with NENOTO Gutierrez in the Second Front of Escaahray. Osiel
vas under asylum in the Brazilian babassy (sic, Argentine
Inbassy?), when TOMEU gained political asylum. When Osiel

7. Upon completing the debriefing, Stroud and TONKU
"exchanged small talk" for a while until TOMEU finally stated
that he still wished there was something more he could do to
help free Cube, and asked "What do you think I should do?"
Stroud replied that no person could really make that type of
decision for another individual, and countered by asking TOMEU
what alternatives he had in mind, other than remaining in the
18 Army as a career military officer.
8. TOMKU replied that, of course, he was once an
agriculturalist, but that there were few job opportunities in
which he could apply his past experience. His sister had also
asked him if he felt he and his family would want to live with
bar in Spain or Mexico, but he didn't think too much of this
idea. He then stated that he had been asked by Manuel ARTINK
to take a job as an instructor. Without indicating any
sssociation of even awareness of ARTIME's activities, or of
ANTINE's contact with TOMEU (as indicated in TOMEU's 201),
PONKU was asked what he thought of ARTIME's proposition.
TOMEU stated that he would no longer follow any man as
individual or as a leader, because a man's ideals, outlook.
and objectives change with time. For example, the people of
Cuba followed Fidel because of the ideals he advocated.
Fidel took over,
When
his accomplishments gradually beoane qasreg
Gifferent from the ideals he had espoused. TOMEU continued
by saying he would "no longer follow a man, One could only
trust his ideals or an organization which followed those
ideals, since a good organization would be lons likely of
being controlled by a single man," When saked for an example
of the type of organization he had in mind, TOMEU replied he
was most favorably inclined towards the ideals and goals of
the JURE, (The JURE or JRC is an organization crested by
Manolo RAY Rivero around a nucleus of former 26 July Movement
Leaders, Bee nemo and attachment dated 23 July 1063 from Joha
Bugh Crinning, Coordinator of Cuban Affairs, ARA, Departmens
