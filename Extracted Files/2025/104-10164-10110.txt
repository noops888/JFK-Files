Contour andre recarked quite flatly that there are really only tho
banks in Haiti, the bit and the Royal Bank. The others are pretty
sad affairs. The BAUS COLC-SC-HAITIA, for example, has a port-
folio of $1.4 million which is, as Andri put it, "all fraud". The
president of that cank, he said, is a rich ran today. His technique,
according to André, is to find someone willing to accept a loan which
he knous cannot or will not repay on mich he kicks back in some cases
more than half. André said he knows personally of one man who was
leaving for the United States who signed notes for 10,000 and ac-
cepted $2,000, the remainder going into the pocket of the bank presi-
dent. As for reserves, the Colomco-Haitian bank has been below the
legal requirements for months and is now paying, in accordance with
law, fines of $150 daily. What will happen when depositors want
their money back ne, André, would rather not think about.
:
André said he knew the bank had tried to interest some American
investors in the business, perhaps in the hope of getting new capital
with which to keep going. He, André, however, understood that the
Americans were a rather dubious Sisni group, even if they did come
in (which he did not at the moment foresee) he didn't think it would
improve the situation. The Colombo-Haitian bank, he said, was in
such poor shape it would take a wajor overhaul to save it.
I had led the conversation over to the Colombo-Haitian bank be-
cause of certain special interests we have. I now took the cocasion
to ask about Clemard CHARLES end his COMERCIAL BANK OF HAITI. André
replied that the situation was practically the same. The bank held
a worthless portfolio made up of notes guaranteed by political figuroş.
Charles himself was dishonest recently, for example, he had approved
a loan for $14,000 on his daughter's signature alone - and he also
knew nothing about banking but he was something of a favorite with
the President who gave hisa support. The Bird holds mortgages on the
Commercial Bank of Haiti, for example, and, since payments are now
substantially in arrears, Andrá said, he might have foreclosed. The
President, however, had asked him not to in order to avoid a
scandal.(5)
Balance of Fayments Situation Temporarily Improved
Turning briefly to the balance of payments question, I asked
André how matters now stood (having in mind, but not mentioning, come

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION
SOURCE: US citizen, former Journalist, who has followed developments in the Caribbean
eres closely for many months and maintains contact with persons directly con
cerned with the ares.
Hie coursend of French and his habit of making isteiled shorthand notes enable
him to report with en unusual degree of accuracy.
1. On 2 May 43, we had a four-hour interview with Clemard Joseph Charles, president
and general wameger of Sanque Commerciele d'lisiti, Port-au-Prince, vice president
of the Eitian Chamber of Commerce, and cousin of Joseph D. Charles, former
Haitian ambassador to the W.
2. Clenard Charles, whose PO Box in Porteu-Priace is No. 5751, told us that he was
enen of peasant stock and that while a business loeder he hes the full confidence
of the predominantly pessant population of Haiti, and, that with the additional
backing of forcibly retired anti-juvelier army officers, intellectuals, journal-
ists end businessmen, he is in a position to become the head of e provisional
government siter Duvalier is removed. He believes the san between now and 15
May when Duvalier's tora expires and 22 May, when his new term is scheduled
to coezenca, vill be the most cruciel period for leiti. il believes Duvelier is
roody to institute a mign of terror, killing those who oppose him, and is
Billing to accept Bovalec help. About two veeks ag. the Polish charge d'affaires
left Port-au-Prince for Poland, and Charles believes be carries Duvelier's re-
quest for economic and poupibly militery help.
3. As vice president of the Chamber of Commerce, he leamed that in early April 1963
• Czechoslovek delegation arrived in Port-au-Prince, presuanbly to discuss
trade matters, e fact which gave rise to rumors that it consisted of militery
techniciens.
4. Carlos firmly believes this will be the last chance for the US Goverment t
help ssteblich a democratie Baiti friendly to the US and save the country for e
Costro-type Coryamist takeover. Although he has born on good terms with Du
velier, he now fools that the President "wont crazy and must be stopped before be

Ho seid about 90% of Haitiens are against Duvelier, who mintains his rule
by keeping the militis strong. Bu Duvelier no longer hos funds to pay
the militiamen but ellove than to "iive off the Lend." Charles believes

De believes the Dominicans could easily defost Heiti's army and militia
but en invesion would cause the Beitians to rally around Pavelier in defense
of their anty.

his vifo, Sophie. On 30 Aur 63, ke arlled her, and she told his "not to

2. Subject telephoned WUBRINY/1 on 1 May and said that

WUBRINY/1 said that he would consider this or have one of his

DO/COEO Memorandum dated 23 April 1963
requesting traces on CLEMARD, Joseph Charles
1. There are no traces on Clenard Joseph CHARLES
(201-357-029) born 21 April 1923 at Gonaives, Haiti, who
is President and General Manager of the Commercial Bank of
Haiti, in RID or at the WH/Haitian Desk. In March 1963,
Biographics Register prepared a summary of information on
Mr. CHARLES for inclusion in the Biographic Intelligence
Report on Haitian Opposition Personalities. This summary
is nade up of information obtained from several different
sources. One source classifies CHARLES as a slippery
character who is active on the Haitian scene and refers to
him as a "promoter" rather than a businessman, who endeavers
to attract United States "venture" capital for various
Haitian projects and then becomes a partner by virtue of
the promotion. Biographics Register has a very high opinion
of this Source, who is the State Department's Haiti Desk
Officer. During a debriefing on CHARLES, in February 1963,
this same source stated that CHARLES is a confidant of
President Duvalier and that he has emerged as an active
businessman by virtue of his priviledged position with the
President.
2. Another source of information regarding CHARLES'
business interests is the President of the National Bank of
Haiti who considers CHARLES, himself, as dishonest. For
example, according to Source, CHARLES approved a loan of
$14,000.00 on his daughter's signature alone. Also, the
Commercial Bank of Haiti held a worthless portfolic made up
