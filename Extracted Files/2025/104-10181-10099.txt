1. WE BELIEVE THAT CHANCE ENCOUNTER WITH AMAUTO-1
ALONE TOO DIFFICULT TO ARRANGE SINCE AMAUTO-1 IS
FREQUENTLY IN COMPANY SOMEONE FROM HIS STAFF OR HAVING
LUNCH WITH SPANISH OFFICIALS OR BUSINESSMENT. MOREOVER,
ENCOUNTER UNDER THIS SITUATION, WE FEEL, WOULD NOT PERMIT
RELAXED EXCHANGE BETWEEN SAMKO AND AMAUTO-I. WE WOULD
LIKE TO SUGGEST FOLLOWING ALTERNATIVE:

AMAUTO-I'S PROBABLE SECOND QUESTION: HOW DID

A MUTUAL FRIEND OF BOTH AMAUTO-1 AND SAMKO WERE TOGETHER

ASKED WHAT HAPPENED TO AMAUTO-1 AND FRIEND DISCLOSED THAT

WERE EXCHANGED. ACCORDING TO MINISTER GUILLERMO RUIZ,
CUBAN CHARGE D'AFFAIRES, THE EMBASSY WILL CHARGE THAT SIX
FUNCTIONARIES AND FOUR DIPLOMATIC COURIERS FROM HAVANA WERE
PHYSICALLY ATTACKED ON 4 MΑΥ ΑΤ ΤΗΣ AIRPORT BY DISAFFECTED

CONSEQUENCE OF REPEATED PROVOCATIONS AT BARAJAS,
SPANISH
AUTHORITIES WERE ASKED TO PREVENT A REPETITION OF THESE
INCIDENTS.
2.
(FIELD COMMENT: ACCORDING TO ANOTHER UNTESTED SOURCE
WHO WAS AN EYEWITNESS TO THE 4 MAY INCIDENT, THE CROWD INCLUDED
23 MEMBERS OF THE CUBAN EMBASSY AND A NUMBER OF CUBAN EXPATRIATES
MEETING AN IBERIA FLIGHT FROM HAVANA WHICH WAS CARRYING 75
CUBAN OFFICIALS AND 30 CUBAN REFUGEES.
MAXIMO
TORRES,
FORMER MAYOR OF SANTIAGO DE CUBA AND A MAN OF OVER 60 YEARS OF
AGE, ADDRESSED ONE OF THE ARRIVING CUBAN OFFICIALS, MISTAKING
HIM FOR A REFUGEE. THE OFFICIAL REBUFFED HIM RUDELY AND A
GENERAL ARGUMENT ENSUED AND BLOWS WERE EXCHANGED. HORACIO
FUENTES MARTINEZ, FIRST SECRETARY OF THE CUBAN EMBASSY,
JUMPED FROM A NEARBY CAR AND PISTOL-WHIPPED ONE OF THE REFUGEES.
AFTER THE POLICE ARRIVED, TORRES AND HIS WIFE NEEDED MEDICAL
ATTENTION.)
3. ON 6 MAY, ROBERTO FRANCO OLIVA, CUBAN CONSUL
IN MADRID, COMPLAINED TO A SPANISH POLICE INSPECTOR CONCERNING
THE INCIDENT AT THE AIRPORT AS FOLLOWS:
A.
THE SCENE AT THE AIRPORT HAD BEEN PREPARED DY THE
C.S. CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA) AND 'COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES."
THE INSPECTOR REPLIED TO THIS THAT SPANISH AUTHORITIES WERE
SECRET NO FOREIGN DISSEM/CONTROLLED DISSEM
TDCSDB-315/02487-70
PAGE 3 OF 4 PAGES
SECRET NO FOREIGN DISSEM/CONTROLLED DISSEM
INVESTIGATING AND WOULD GIVE CUBAN OFFICIALS THE PROTECTION IN
SPAIN WHICH THEY SHOULD HAVE. HE SAID THAT THREE CUBAN REFUGEES
HAD BEEN ARRESTED AND WOULD BE DEPORTED TO FRANCE, FOR THEIR
PART, THE REFUGEES HAD SAID THAT HORACIO FUENTES HAD PULLED
OUT A GUN DURING THE FIGHT, A CHARGE WHICH FRANCO DENIED AT
LENGTH.
B. MANY OTHER ATTACKS HAVE BEEN SUFFERED BY CUBAN
OFFICIALS AT THE AIRPORT AND DAMAGE DONE TO THEIR PARKED CARS,
c. WHEN CUBAN SEAMEN ARE ARRESTED BY THE SPANISH
POLICE IN THE CANARY ISLANDS THEY ARE INTERROGATED SEPARATELY
IN THE POLICE STATION BY AN AGENT OF THE CIA WHO IS A CUBAN
"GUSANO" (TURNCOAT).
D. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SPANISH REPUBLICANS AND
SPANISH COMMUNISTS IN CUBA, THE SPANISH EMBASSY IN HAVANA IS
NEVER MOLESTED.
Ε. FRANCO IS PREPARED TO ADVISE CUBAN PASSENGERS
COMING TO SPAIN TO CARRY RAZORS FOR SELF DEFENSE. CUBAN OFFI-
CIALS, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO GO TO THE AIRPORT, SHOULD APPLY
FOR LICENSES TO CARRY PISTOLS,
4.
(FIELD COMMENT: ACCORDING TO AN OFFICIAL SPANISH
SERVICE, CUBAN DIPLOMATS MAY APPLY FOR GUN PERMITS TO THE
SPANISH FOREIGN MINISTRY AND WOULD PROBABLY RECEIVE PERMISSION.
NON-DIPLOMATIC CUBANS MUST APPLY TO THE DIRECTORATE GENERA OF
