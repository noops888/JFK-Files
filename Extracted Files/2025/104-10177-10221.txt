SUBJECT : GENERAL O John Augustus McVICKAR, Jre 201-33608
1. Subject is presently employed in Paris by Trans World Airline
in the capacity of Special Sales Représentative. He is well known to
Douglas C. HARE and Eleanor T. HARTWELL, the former having known him
socially for a number of years and the latter having dealt with him on
transportation problems since his appointment, fifteen months ago, to the
position he now occupies with TWA.
2. Subject is also a long-time friend of UMOVED, who brought him
to our attention as a potential recruit and who has provided us with the
biographical information contained in the attached personal record form
No. 51-67.
3. From what I have been able to gather from UNMOVED, as well as
from HARP and HARTWELL, subject appears to be the type of individual which
might be ideally suited to fulfill certain valuable operational assignments
in France, such as "spotter" for other high-level potential agents, high-
level contacts, cut-out, etc. All who know him agree that subject is capable
of doing anything and getting to know anyone" if he so chooses. Apparently
subject, despite the "brass which surrounds his perceptible personality, is
a serious-minded, intelligent and patriotic individual who has had much ex-
perience along lines which could be of use to this organization, as well as
an uncanny knack of being able to introduce and ingratiate himself into prac-
tically any milieu of interest to his work or wishes. A partial list of
subject's fairly close friends, as reported by UNOVED on Page 8-a of attach-
pent, shows the variety of people subject knows and sees whenever they are
in this area. Undoubtedly, subject himself could add a much longer list of
names to those reported herein, particularly with respect to contacts in
Europe.
4. I am assured by UMOVED that subject, despite despite his ability to
ake and keep murerous and varied friendships, is far from being a "good
tine Charlie". He is, on the other hand, che of those characters whow every-
one likes and trusts and who goes out of their way to see as often as occa-
cion permits. UIDED assures re that subjecticularly good friend

this Station and the organization as a whole. Subj 29 a wholo. Subjectiuas absolute free-
dom of movement outside France (usually by WA), entree into practically
any milieu his assignments might require require and and is is known known to to be be a an intelli-
gent, hard-working and patriotic individual
6. On a recent tour of inspection of the TWA circuit, Warren L
PIERSON, Chairman of the Board of TWA, assured subject he would endeavor
to secure for hin an additional allotment of funds to supplement his
present expense account budget. Due to budgetary restrictions this has
not been possible and subject is at present seeking another, more remuner-
`ative position, since he claims that his present income of approximately
$666.00 monthly (including expense account) is insufficient to permit him
to live in Paris and maintain the contacts and activity required by his
job. According to UNLMOVED, subject is at present endeavoring to secure
from his good friend Benjamin KATZ (President of the Gruen Watch Co.) the
sales agency for Gruen watches in Europe. Meanwhile, however, subject is
not contemplating resigning his position with TWA until he has a firm and
more remunerative position. UNMCVED states that subject plans to remain
with TWA at least until the end of the year, by which time he may have
secured something better. Subject has also had talks with James A. FARIFY
(on his recent trip to France) concerning the possibility of handling the
Coca-Cola agency here. Nothing has come of this possibility to date, but
subject appears to be hopeful.
7. UNMOVED is of the opinion that subject would be most receptive
to a proposition of doing intelligence work and furthermore believes that
if subject could supplement his present income by an additional $200 or
$300 per month, he would be willing to remain with THA, which he likes
and is only considering leaving due to his present low total income, much
of which is spent in connection with activities required by his position.
8. UICOVED hás, of course, ever even hinted to subject anything
about his ca undercover activities and is sure subject does not suspect
that the former is doing anything but his cover work in France. UNMOVED,
when questioned as to his opinion concerning subject's potential value
as a covert agent, as well as his recuitability, has pointed out very
strongly that subject, due to the very nature of his personality, must
be given a good deal of operational guidance and be closely controlled.
Questioned as to whether some other individual should endeavor to recruit
subject, UNMOVED, was of the opinion that, should the organization desire
to do so, he would be best fitted to exploit subject's potential, sime

he has known hin for a good many years and as a close friend, knows his
strong and weak points and could, in gelerat, inataile subject to better
advantage than another individual who might have only occasional contact
with him,
9. Te request that consideration de given to the advisability of
endeavoring to recruit subject and, in the event of a favorable decision,
that provisional operational clearance be given in order that subject may
be approached on the subject of engaging in intelligence work. With
regard to whom should actually recruit subject, we suggest that HARE might
safely make the first approach and, if subject accepts and firal security
is obtained, he might eventually be turned over to UEMOVED for exploita-
tion.
10. We would appreciate your reactions to the desirability of
recruiting subject, as well as your thoughts as to how best exploit his
obvious potential.

11. If subject's recruitability is approved in principle and he
is given provisional security clearance, this Station would then prepare
a field project outline, to be submitted to you for approval.

30. EMPLOYMENT HISTORY. (Include type of work done, dates, employers,.
and addresses.)
Business career began in Europe. Brought up in France and speaking French,
was appointed, at the age of 18, General Sales Agent for minerous
American products including Jantzen Bathing Suits, Three-In-One Oil, the
Franklia Motor Car and the Le Baron Motor Car. Successful with these lines,
later became General Sales Agent in France for Dusenburg Motor Cars and the
Packard Motor Car Company. Almost immediately after taking on Packard sales
he accepted a proposition to work exclusively for the Packard Motor Car. Co.
Remained with the company in Paris for two years, or until early in 1931.
Tas then sent to the United States by the company to handle Packard sales in
Buffalo, New York where he remained until the autumn of 1932.
At that time he was approached by Raymond-Whitcomb Inc., a leading American
travel company, specializing in deluxe tours and cruises, and asked to take
over sales in the New York Office due to his knowledge of Europe and his
contacts in Europe and the United States who were potertial customers for
nigh priced travel offerings. He went to work in the company's principal
sales office at 670 Fifth Avenue and remained there until 1940. The travel
business became so severely restricted after the outbreak of war in Europe
that Raymond-Whitcomb Inc. was obliged to close most of its offices. Sales
were at a standstill and, as ne we working by his own choice on a commission
basis, it was necessary for him to leave. During his eight-year tenure with
Raymond Whitcomb Inc. he wrote on an average of $500,000 worth of business
yearly by himself.
After leaving Raymond-Whitcomb Inc., he took a position as Assistant General
Marager of the St. Regis Hotel in New York and subsequently transferred to
the Hotel Pierre in the same capacity. He remained at the Hotel Pierre until
19142.

Associates most often in France with the "international set", wealthy and

In the U.S. his contacts include persons of high social position and leaders
in business and industry. This has been brought about partly by the nature
of his work in selling deluxe transportation on two continents and partly by
family background and early life in Europe.

30. ENTIONEM ESTORY. (Continued)
Attempting to volunteer for service in the US. Armed Forces he was turned
down as being overweight. He then approached the C. S. Red Cross, was
accepted, and sent imediately to Sidney, Australia as manager of the U.S.
Officers' Club in that city. Subsequently, he served in New Juinea, and in
Leyte and Lanila in the Philippines.
After two and a half years overseas he became eligible for discharge and
rade pplication to return to the United States. He went directly to Wash-.
ington D.C. upon his arrival to operate there the Tar Service Bureau of the
American Optical Company. The Bureau handled that company's business rela-
tions with foreign governments and aided implementation of U.S. Army, Nery
and Air Cores contracts.
i
With the war over and the War Service Bureau about to close, he refused a
position with the American Optical Company Sales Division, to re-enter the
Transportation field. He joined a newly-formed airline called Transair Inc.,
at that time one of the leading charter companies.
Due to the uncertain position of charter lines within the aviation industry
he decided to accept an offer made to him by American Airlines to go to
Europe as District Traffic Manager for Hoiland, Belgium and Luxembourg with
headquarters in Amsterdan. He remained with American Overseas Airlines until.
he had ar opportunity to transfer to Trans World Airline which made it possible
for hint: return to Paris as Special Sales Representative, covering large
corporatica, goverment accounts and the motion picture industry. He has now
been with Trans World Airline in Paris for fifteen months.
For verification of his employment history the following persons are cffered
as references. Both are familiar with his business career and have known
him personally for years. As is indicated by the above he has been employed
by both.

PARI-4214
1. We regret that circumstances beyond our control prompted us to
dispatch PARI-421, on the off chance that Subject might be of sufficient
Interest to you as a potential candidate for recruitment, thus bringing to
a head a question which normally would have followed its course through the
mill. In this case, however, due to Subject's alleged resignation from TWA,
we felt that a cable such as the one we dispatched was justified, dhe to the
fact that unless some quick action is taken, Subject will definitely leave his
present job with d and seek employment elsewhere.
2. Cn 10 December, Subject had luncheon with EIRF and unloaded all his
financial troubles. In a casual way HARE asked him if by any chance he would
be willing to stay on at Tha if his salary were supplemented. Subject took
esgerly to this possibility, since it is well-known that Subject likes his
job and desireş very much to remain, but is resigning merely for financial
reasons. In consultation with UNTOVED and MANE, both of whom know Subject
well, it is apparent that probably $300 monthly would allow Subject to decide
to stay with TWA, provided we are sufficiently interested in recruiting him
for intelligence activities.
3. Attached hereto is UmTTED's latest report on Subject, dated 8 Decen-
ter, and prepared prior to IARE's luncheon with Subject. There seems to be
sone question as to whether Subject has actually submitted his resignation to
ThA in writing. According to twoven, he has, whereas Subject denied this to
HARE.. In ary event, it is well known in Paris that Subject is taking tertinal
leave at present, prior to leaving Th
h. We now await your reaction as to whether you feel that in principis
HEVICKAR is worth recruiting. it is too early, not having had specific and
detailed talks with CeVIOKAR, to submit a project outline, but all here are
agreed that the organization could benefit conci ciderably by Subject's extensive
contacts in all countries of hastern Europe.

Subject is quitting his position as traffic representative with Trans World Airline
as of 31 December, 1949. In August, 1949, subject advised his superiors, including
WARREN LEE PIERSON, Chairman of the Board of THA and a personal friend, that he could
not continue wiless a larger salary and a more liberal expense account were forth-
coming. He was informed in due course by Vice President COCKE that it was impossible
for the company to give him more money within the present wage structura.
Subject
therefor decided to seek other employment. On or about 15 November subject was
advised by Overseas Manager THORNTON that he could proceed to make new arrangements
as of the end of the year. Whether cubject actually resigned or was asked to
terminate his connection due to his repeated Gamands for more money is not completely
clear to the writer.
::
Oversoas Kanager THORNTON was never sympathetic with the subject. According to
STANLEY MARKUSEN, TWA Overseas Public Relatione Director, THORNTON was jealous of
subject's popularity. On the other hand, JOHN WICELL, Traffic Manager for Paris,
and subject's immediate superior, was,, and continues to be, his strong supporter.
On the basis of business produced WICIEL! has told the writer that subject is the
company's most valuable employe overseas. MARKUSEN concurs in that belief.
Subject is highly regarded by OSCAR HOLCO1B and PALIER BRADLEY, directors of TWA.
In addition he is a close frienft of PIERSON, Chairman of the Board, who engaged him
directly in the first place. llone of these, however, seem willing to run counter to
the economy drive now in progress within TWA sponsored by new President RALPH
DALON.
Wiless there is a last minute change in policy subject's termination will stand.
Subject's future is uncertain. He has been in touch with a friond of his in New York
named HARVEY DWIGHT. DIT makes frequent business trips to Europe on behalf of his
own company which deals in spare parts for airplanes. He has intimated that he
might use subject in Europe for six to eight months and then bring him back to the
U.S. for employment in Washington. As ofthe above date DAIGHT has made subject no
definite offer but has advised him in a letter seen by the writer not to worry about
his future.
Ex-Postmaster General JAMES PARLEY, now with the CocaCola Company, was interested
recently in hiring subject for work in France but that idea seems now to have been
dropped.
CHAPLES ROJER3, Paris automobile dealer, has asked subject to work for him but subject
has refused.
Subject is hard pressed for money. He has outstanding debts and liin salery from
TWA, in the vicinity of $550: montlily, had never been sufficient for his needs. In
October, 1949, Till out the living allowance paid to employes overseas. According
to subfoot that cost him about $150. monthly and forced him irito debt.
