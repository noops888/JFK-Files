Anatoliy Mikhaylovich GOLITSYN
05
TEPLYAKOVA did not in fact meet GOLITSYN as
previously stated but only knew of her and GOLITSYN
from her parents.
2. Source is quite clear about GOLUBOV's instructions
and had not confused the names of GOLITSYN and KOSKO.
GOLUBOV had been sent a directive from Moscow setting
out his main tasks. This was couched in somewhat rough,
direct words in order to put him on the right lines.
Source did not deduce from what was in this directive
that the K.G.B. believed that either man was living in
England. It certainly stated that NOSKO had visited
England after his defection and that GOLITSYN had
visited England several times. Source knows only what
GOLUBOV told him and what was in the directive; he has
no idea why the K.G.B. believed that either of the two
defectors had visited the U.K.

Para. 3: It is stated here that Source's son's wife
visiting her parents in Helsinki heard GOLITSYN's
story (presumably this means his defection) and also
met his wife. The word order implies that she met
Mrs. GOLITSYN after hearing about the defection, but
this could not be, since Mrs. GOLITSYN defected with
her husband. Please clarify this and give details of
the GOLITSYN story she heard, what were the dates
of her visit to Helsinki?
Para. 3-b: The wording of this paragraph is almost identical
to much of paragraph 3-b of Source's report on Yuriy
Ivanovich NOSKO, regarding GOLUBOV's instructions,
belief that both defectors had visited Poland,
attempts to locate them, etc. The main differences
as given in these reports is that NOSKO is said to
have been in the US in 1965, and GOLITSYN "several
times". Since NOSKO did not visit the US in 1965,
but we understand that GOLITSYN did make several visits,
we wonder (in view of the strong similarities in wording)
if there may be a garble in Source's reporting. Does
Source have any idea as to why the K.G.B. believed either
of the two defectors had visited the U.K.?
