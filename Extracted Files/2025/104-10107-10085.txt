First, when did (BELOSE Roberts) become aware that Itkin and the
Conestoga Group) had approached (Roberts) with a proposal to represent
them in (Africa) We were advised in 1966 through case officer
meetings with (Roberts) that he had been developing some potential
cover company business with interests from the United States and
England. We were given the name of the Conestoga Group) no later
than 27 October 1966. We cannot say that we then knew the
individual names of those involved. It was not uncommon for
03 (Roberts) to have discussions with a number of potential clients;
when it became apparent that no real business was forthcoming
from this group, our interest ceased.
At the 30 January meeting, we were also asked certain 68
questions about (Roberts) financial involvement with the (law firm)
he and Itkin has been with prior to (Robert's) association with
the Agency.

that he entered into an agreement with the firm on 31 May 1961 wherein he was
authorized leave of absence from 1 June 1961 to 31 May 1963 drawing $100.00
per week for that period.
