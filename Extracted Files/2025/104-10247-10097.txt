MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Meeting with AMLASH-1 in Paris,
31 January to 3 February 1965
1. AMLASH-1 returned from Rome to Paris on 31 Jan 1965
and was met for a very brief meeting the same night by ONTRICH
in order to arrange a meeting for the following day.
following subjects were discussed at the two meetings on 1 and
2 February 1965:
The
2. The primary reason for again meeting AMLASH-1
before his planned return to Cuba was to brief him on the
security implications involved in the infiltration and
possible capture of Modesto Orlando Orozco Basulto ΑΚΑ
Pebo Orozco, who infiltrated into Cuba on 21 Dec 1964.
Vasquez Kerey) and three others who were hiding in the
home of a woman named Gloria Cabrera who lived at No. 72 οδ
27th Street) between CN & O, Apartment 3, Vedado Havana.
Orozco's capture, if he has been captured, presents an
indirect threat to the security of AMLASH-1 and a more
direct threat to the security of ANTRUNK-10 since Orozco
in Jan 1964 exfiltrated through the rat line established
by AMICE-14 (Miguelito). Upon his return to Cuba,
AMLASH-1 will check the above with AMTRUNK-10; and, if
Orozco is under the control of the security service, will
decide and communicate with Miami whether ANLASH-1 and
AMTRUNK-10 believe it necessary to exfiltrate ANTRUNK-10.
AMLASH-1 was briefed to send a letter to (UNSNAFU-9 to
indicate whether Orozco has been arrested or whether he is
still in hiding.

to send a report on the above and any complications which
have developed or may develop from Orozco's infiltration.
Orozco, according to his de, went to Cuba to rescue Jop 06
b. AMLASH-1 suggested that his nom de guerre "Charles,"
which we have been using for the past three years, be
changed to "Gerardo."

c. AMLASH-1 was given a resupply of S/W developer
pills and carbon. He planned to take the S/W material
back with him to Havana.JAMLASH-1 again reviewed with
UNSNAFU-9 and reminded NSNAFU-9 to turn over to his (Paris)
case officer all letters regardless of how received from
AMLASI-1 to either USNAFU-9 or letters that may be addressed
to his parents-in-law. AMLASH-1 also agreed to send 8/
out in letters addressed to Juan Ventura (AMWHIP-I's
business partner) in Geneva or Rome. AMWHIP-I was briefed
to inform Ventura that any letters he received from
AMLASH-1 should be inmediately air mailed to ANTHIP-1
in New York. Since AHLASH-1 will probably find it
necessary some time not to sign the letters to Ventura
in his true name, AMWHIP-1 was also briefed to inform
Ventura to forward to New York any letter received from
Cuba, addressed to him and signed by a person unknown to
hir. S/W letters to AMLASH-1 should continue to be
addressed to Ernestina Acosta, Edf. No. 526, Apt. 8, 04.08
Esquina Calles 25 y H.) In an emergency a letter can also
be sent to AMLASH-1's mother.
d. AMLASH-1 was again debriefed on the cache that had
been put down for him in Matanzas. He repeated what he
had previously reported and attempted to answer most of
the questions in the AVE cable. A cable on this subject
was sent from (Paris) to Headquarters, info WAVE, on 2 Feb.
AMLASH-1 was requested to send a message either through
his channel or through ANTRUNK-10's S/W chonnel reporting
how much of the radio equipment and other material had
been recovered from the cache.
e. AMLASH-1 was asked if he knew of any individual in
Cuba whom he could recruit and who could be inserted into
the Cuban Intelligence Service with the idea of attempting
to get the DGI to assign this man to Caracas, Venezuela.
AMLASH-1 could think of only one possibility, an individual
known as Gustavo Gonzalez), 06 AMLASH-1 has full confidence
bin Gustavo and Gustavo) has previously been approached on
several occasions by Pinero to work for him. Upon his
return to Cuba AMLASH-1 will check to find out if Gustavo
can still get himself recruited by Pinero and then be
sent on a mission abroad, hopefully to Caracas. (AMWHIP-1, fe
who also knows Gustavo) will provide the background infor
mation upon his return to New York.)
f. AMLASH-1 reported on the upcoming FEU elections
on 10 February 1965. ANLASH-1 stated that Crombet, the
president of the Communist Youth, will become the new
14-00000
-3-
president and that his man, Lagaro Mora, would be one of
the vice-presidents. (A cable on this subject was sent
to Headquarters from Paris.))
g. AMLASI-1 was requested to check with Fizzolo)
regarding the precautions being taken to prevent sabotage
of the locmotives being shipped from France to Cuba;
specifically, how carefully do they check the placement
of the seals, are they special seals or regular lead
seals, are there going to be any additional checks once
the locomotives reach Cuba, will they drain the oil and
lubricants from the factory to the port, and do they run
the locomotives under their own power or are they towed.
AMLASH-1 agreed to attempt to develop answers to the above
requirements and pass the information to his contact in
the Paris Station AMLASH-1 also agreed to attempt to find
out and pass to the Paris Station) through (UNSNAFU-9 the
names of the Cuban techs training at La Rochelle.
h. In a general discussion regarding the persons with
whom AMLASH-1 had been in contact either personally or
through letters, AMLASH-1 mentioned Alfredo Portela.
AMLASH-1 stated he had received a letter from Portela and
had in turn written to Portela. He considers Portela a
friend which was the only reason for writing to him.
i. ANLASH-1 was debriefed on Cuban Intelligence
Service personnel. A cable on this subject was sent from
Paristo Headquarters.
j. A cable was sent from Paris) to Headquarters
suggesting AVE send a S/W letter to AMTRUNK-10 stating:
"Este tranquilo. Carlos regresa pronto."
k. AMLASH-1 was asked for information on the fol-
lowing persons:
(1) Samuel Gonzalez Rodriguez-Planes. AMLASH-1
reports he is a member of the Ameijeiras group and
is a good and brave man.
(2) Antonio Lusson y Batlle, Chief of Operations
of the General Staff of the Occidental Army.
ANLASH-1 reports Lusson is an independent and rare
type individual who keeps to himself and doesn't
involve himself in political matters. AMLASH-1 has
heard nothing bad about lusson.

(3) Cadte. Raul Diaz Arguelles, Chief of
Artillery of the Occidental rmy.
(4) Elpidio Baez Bigo.
Baez is a trusted Fidelman.
According to ANLASH-1,
(5) Luis Manuel Cantillo Toirac. Assigned to
the Cuban Embassy in Madrid and one of the security
people. He was formerly assigned to Brazil, is young
and has for several years been with Pinero and the
Cuban IS.
(6) Enrique Oltuski Osacki. Oltuski is a close
friend of Faustino Perez and his stock with the regime
rises or falls as does that of Faustino.
(7) Sergio Tollen. Code clerk in the Embassy in
Paris. Tollon is staying in Paris at the request of
Ambassador Carrillo.
l. Gastro enteritis, water pollution and unsanitary
conditions. AMLASH-1 states there are no real problems,
although the scarcity and lack of a balanced diet do
cause some problems. The purification of water has been
a problem which probably has been the cause of some of the
sickness in the country.
m. AMLASH-1 did not believe that Aragones had invited
him to fly back to Havana with him in order to get him
back because of any serious security matter. AMLASH-1
did state that Aragones was concerned that AMLASH-1 may not
return to Cuba. Since Aragones cleared AMLASH-1 for his
trip abroad, he is in a way responsible that AMLASH-1 does
not defect and returns to Cuba. AMLASH-1 feels Aragones
does not want any problems with Fidel in case AMLASH-1
decides to stay out.
n. AMLASH-1 was unable to provide any information on
the political developments in Cuba in mid-November and
December since he had been out of the country since early
November. AMLASH-I was asked to check on the problems
between the opposing factions in the Cuban leadership and
explained the issues, the background and personalities
involved.
o. Soviet advise or influence in political and economic
matters creates resentment among the middle and higher level
Cuban officials. Basically, the Soviets are not respected.

p. Rank of Cuban officials under Fidel in terms of
their influence in making national policy. Raul is still
the heir apparent to Fidel. Next to Paul is Che Guevara.
After that, no other official, according to ANLASH-1, has
any great influence in the making of Cuban national policy.
President Dorticos' relationship with Fidelis good since
he is a hard and serious worker, has good administrative
ability and is able to work within the general outline laid
down by Fidel. Raul Castro has some political influence
and control in Oriente where he has placed his men in
positions of influence, but only Fidel personally has any
poltical influence in the rest of Cuba. Even within the
military Fidel selects and appoints high army officers.
Che Guevara is still strong in the ecocomic field and
has not suffered a decline in his influence and authority
because of his earlier policy of industrialization.
Guevara restricts himself to the economic field and plays
& very small role in the political field.
and very hard worker, one of the few, according to AMLASH-1,
who has worked seven days a week without leave since the
revolution. Emilio Aragones holds an important position
as the organizational secretary of the PURS. He is the
official who was always at the office of the National
Directorate of the Party and has contact with all the
officials in the regime. He plays an important coordinating
role. Faure Chomon has been accused of organizing former
13th of March Revolutionary Directorate people, but,
according to AMLASH-1, this probably based on the fact that
Chomon always gives jobs in the ministry he heads to DR
people. Because of this Chomon today controls to a large
degree the Ministry of Transportation.
the DR's stronghold is in the Ministry of Transportation.
Other DR people who continue to hold important positions
in the regime are Alberto Hora, Ambassador Carrillo and
Jose Naranjo.
He is serious
Of all the ministries,
q. AMLASH-1 and AMWHIP-1 were unable to develop any
specifics, but from their conversations with Ambassador
Carrillo got the impression that Carrillo would prefer and
welcome a transfer from the Embassy in Paris to the
Embassy in Madrid.
r. According to Emilio Aragones, Anibal Escalante
is being considered for a job outside Cuba. The job will
probably be in the commercial/economic field, but a
decision had not been made as of November 1964 as to
location.

s. AMLASH-1 again reported that he feels Orlando
Blanco, Consul of the Cuban Embassy in Bernpis
approachable since he is unhappy with the Cuban regime.
AMLASH-1 also feels that Enrique Rodriguez Loeches,206
Cuban Ambassador in Rabat is approachable if approached
and developed by the right person. Marina Garcia Gonzalez 206
assigned to the commercial section of the Cuban Embassy
in Rabato ANLASH-1 feels is also approachable and feels
money can be used as an inducement. Ambassador Carrillo,
AMLASH-1 feels, if the proper person developed his, could
probably be compromised with Fidel. He is a character
and could easily be entangled according to ANLASH-1 in
a compromising situation. Ambassador Carrillo is a close
friend of Lucy Echevarria.
t. ANLASH-1 was also asked information on a long list
of other requirements on Cuba. On many he was unable to pro-
vide information and cables were sent to Headquarters on the
requirements on which he did provide information.
