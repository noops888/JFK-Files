1. Transmitted herewith are photostatic copies of two letters sent
to Lucas Moran, representative of the Movimiento Democrata Cristiano in
Cuba. The original letters, one of which was written by Jose Ignacio
RASCO and the other by Rafael AGUIRRE, deal with RASCO's connection with
the MDC. They were obtained for duplication by AMULLA-1, who had been
charged by the correspondents with getting them into Cuba in the diplomatic
pouch carried by a courier of the Italian Embassy.
