CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE CENTRAL VIETNAM THOáº T XAC PHONG TRAO
(TXPT), (SOURCE COMMENT.. TXPT DOES NOT TRANSLATE MEANINGFULLY

THE VNQDD STRONGHOLD. THE TXPT, ALTHOUGH COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF FORMER
VNQDD MEMBERS, WAS ESTABLISHED ESSENTIALLY AS A BUDDHIST ASSOCIATION
AND HAS BEEN LEGALLY ENGAGED IN CIVIC AND SOCIAL ACTIVITIES SINCE
ITS FORMATION. CLANDESTINE POLITICAL ORGANIZATION HAS PROCEEDED
FOR THE PURPOSE OF DEVELOPING NEW, YOUNGER LEADERS, AND OF DENYING
THE OLDER PASSIVE TENETS OF BUDDHISM AS WELL AS THE OLDER LEADERS
OF THE VNQDD, THE ULTIMATE INTENT BEING A REVITALIZED REVOLUTIONARY
SPIRIT. (FIELD COMMENT. LUC IS THE FATHER AND ACCOMPLICE OF NGUYEN
VAN CU, ONE OF THE TWO PILOTS WHO SOMBED THE PRISIOONTIAL PALACE
ON 27 FEBRUARY 1962.)
..
2. THE TXPT CENTRAL COMMITTEE REMINDED LUC THAT THE ORGAN1-
ZATION WAS IN A POSITION TO HANDLE A COUP ACTION IN CENTRAL VIETNAM
EFFECTIVELY, POINTING OUT THAT THOSE MILITARY UNITS NOT CONTROLLED
COULD BE NEUTRALIZED AND THAT THE AIR BASE AT DA NANG COULD BE
CONTROLLED THROUGH THE AIR FORCE. THE COMMITTEE STATED THAT, AFTER
THE ANTI-BUDDHIST ACTIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT, THE PEOPLE WERE READY
FOR AN UPRISING. BY TAKING NGO DINH CAN AND ARCHBISHOP NGO DINH
THUC INTO CUSTODY AND BY GAINING MILITARY CONTROL OVER THUA THIEN
AND QUANG NAM PROVINCES, SUCCESS COULD BE ASSURED IN CENTRAL VIETNAM.
THIS WOULD PLACE THE TXPT IN A POSITION OF USING PRESIDENT DIEM'S
TACTICS OF NEGOTIATIONS AGAINST HIM, I.E., HAVING GAINED CONTROL
OVER CENTRAL VIETNAM THEY WOULD OFFER TO NEGOTIATE WITH DIEM

AND AT THE SAME TIME, THEY WOULD BE MOUNTING A COUP AGAINST THE
REGIME IN SAIGON, WHICH WOULD TAKE PLACE NO LATER THAN THREE DAYS
AFTER THE ONE IN CENTRAL VIETNAM.
3.
LUC SENT A TRUSTED FOLLOWER, ONE VIET TO SAIGON TO DISCUSS
THE PLAN WITH AN OPPOSITIONIST SYMPATHIZER AND GET HIS VIEWPOINT.
VIET WAS ADVISED TO TELL LUC THAT ANY SUCH ACTION WAS PRECIPITATE
AND DANGEROUS. ALTHOUGH IT WAS PROBABLY TRUE THAT THE FORMER VNQDD
MEMBERS IN CENTRAL VIETNAM HAD THE POWER CLAIMED, A COUP THERE,
WITHOUT SIMULTANEOUS ACTION IN SAIGON, WOULD LEAVE A VACUUM WHICH
THE VIET CONG (VC) COULD IMMEDIATELY USE TO THEIR OWN ADVANTAGE.
VC REACTION PROBABLY WOULD TAKE THE FORM OF GAINING CONTROL OF ALL
AREAS NOT EFFECTIVELY CONTROLLED BY THE COUP GROUP, WITH THE
ULTIMATE POSSIBILITY OF PARTITIONING CENTRAL VIETNAM, OF BEING IN A
POSITION TO FORM A REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT, AND FINALLY, OF BEING
ABLE TO CALL FOR NEGOTIATIONS. THEMSELVES. ACCORDING TO VIET, THIS
FOLLOWED LUC'S THINKING, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE HIS FOLLOWERS WERE NOT
IN A POSITION TO ACT IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY. VIET
THOUGHT THAT LUC WOULD INSTRUCT THE TXPT CENTRAL COMMITTEE IN.
CENTRAL VIETNAM TO TAKE NO ACTION AT THIS TIME, AND THAT LUC'S
ADVICE WOULD BE ACCEPTED.
