This memorandum and its enclosure contain
information concerning an interview on July 28, 1975, of
former FBI Inspector Donald E. Moore by Mr. Loch Johnson,
SSC Staff Member. Mr. Moore entered on duty with the FBI
on March 10, 1941, and served continuously in a variety of
assignments until his retirement on June 29, 1973.
On advance notice from Mr. Johnson, Mr. Moore vas
advised that i'r. Johnson desired to interview him at Mr. Ibore's
convenience relative to his knowledge of the Huston Report.
Mr. Moore was advised that he was being released from any
applicable employment agreement for purposes of the SSC
interview concerning the Huston Report. It was explained
to him that he had the right to counsel; however, the FBI
would be unable to provide private counsel. Ile was also advised
that there were certain privileged areas concerning which he
would not be required to answer questions. These areas
concerned information which might divulge the identities of
FBI sources; information relating to sensitive methods and
techniques; information which might adversely effect ongoing
FBI investigations; and information originating with other
agencies, including foreign intelligence agencies. Mr. Moore
was advised that if he desired an FDI representative to be
available for consultation at the time and place of the
interview, one would be supplied. Mr. Moore commented that

made arrangements to be interviewed in Mr. Moore's office on

Interview of Donald E. Moore by
Mr. Loch Johnson, Senate Select Committee
July 28, 1975
;
Mr. Johnson stated at the outset that this was an informal
interview and he did not place me under oath. He asked about my
background which was provided him and included the fact that I
served in the FBI from March 10, 1941, until my retirement at
the end of June 1973.
The interview concerned the so-called Huston Committee
and he asked if I knew Tom Charles Huston before the Committee
was established. I said I recalled meeting Huston once, in Bill
Sullivan's office, but I didn't recall when this was, but it was before
the Committee was formed. In response to questions, Mr. Johnson
was informed as follows:
I was aware of the meeting at the White House attended by
Director Hoover, Mr. Helms, Admiral Gayler and Gen. Bennett.
I was probably aware the meeting was to take place before the
meeting date but I can't recall this. (He said the meeting was
held June 5, 1970.) I was not at a meeting held in Mr. Hoover's
office June 8 but I recall hearing about the meeting, probably
from Bill Sullivan. I don't recall a meeting held in the Domestic
Intelligence Division after this at which Sullivan, Bill Cregar,
George Moore, Fred Cassidy and I were present. I did attend the
initial meeting of the Working Group headed by Sullivan and was
present because Sullivan asked me to be there. I remember Sullivan
and Cregar were at the meeting and I thought one or more other FBI
representatives were present. He mentioned George Moore and
Fred Cassidy were at the meeting.
I recall Mr. Helms and Mr. Angleton from. CIA were present
but did not recall the names of others including the representatives
from NSA, DIA and the military services. I recall Sullivan chaired
the meeting and that Huston sat at the opposite end of the table.
Either Helms or Sullivan announced that Helms probably couldn't
stay for the entire meeting but I don't recall Helms leaving, although
he did not sit directly at the conference table.

ENCLOSURE, 62-116395-543

I can't recall the conversation at the meeting but think that
Sullivan outlined the request of the President to study means of
getting better intelligence information on new left activities and
violent protest movements in the US, especially with regard to
possible foreign support. I think Sullivan probably outlined areas
of concern and asked representatives present to document where they
felt intelligence was lacking, how it could be obtained, who should
obtain it and what was needed to obtain it. I said I couldn't at this
date recall specific observations or proposals and rather believed
the purpose of the meeting was to outline the general problem and
ask the representatives to document these and come in with specific
recommendations at a subsequent meeting. I am certain Mr. Huston
spoke about the purpose of the meeting but I can't recall his comments.
This was the only meeting of the Working Group I attended.
I told Mr. Sullivan that if agreeable with him I would not attend
subsequent meetings and I thought the FBI had several representatives
present and that the thrust was on new left and related activities. As
I recall he said "suit yourself." Johnson pressed me on this and I
told him this was what I expressed to Sullivan but I also was somewhat
uneasy after the first meeting as I did not believe Mr. Hoover was
aware of collection efforts that were likely to be recommended. I
could not state what FBI members attended subsequent meetings but
I believe Charles Brennan and Bill Cregar, and of course, Bill
Sullivan, attended as well as some other representatives.
I can't say who drafted the report but was sure it was under
Sullivan's direction. During the period of the meetings Deke DeLoach
had retired and Sullivan had been appointed Assistant to the Director
and moved from the 9th & D Building to the Justice Building. I
don't recall when Mr. Hoover's objections to certain of the
recommendations were added. I can't say whether I saw the report
prior to the objections being in it but may have; I do recall seeing
the report after the objections were in it. I don't know whether
Mr. Hoover told Sullivan to put the objections in it but presume
Sullivan knew Mr. Hoover's views and put the objections in on this
basis. I could not answer the question as to whether Mr. Tolson
was the person responsible for having the objections made but felt
he would have objected to the initial recommendations.
NW 88326 Docld:32989627 Page 18
-2-

I did see the letter from the White House saying the report
had been approved. I believe it was signed by Huston and stated
the President had approved the recommendations. I was aware
Mr. Hoover had either written or seen Attorney General Mitchell
expressing his reluctance and was aware the White House letter was
withdrawn. I din't know why it was withdrawn other than this
occurred after Mr. Hoover went to the Attorney General.
Mr. Johnson asked certain specific questions during or
after the above discussion. He asked what covert mail coverage
was involved since CIA in 1970 was engaged in covert mail inter-
ception. After checking with Mr. Leon F. Schwartz of the FBI,
Mr. Johnson was advised that while I had been released from my
pledge of confidentiality by the FBI in general with regard to the
Huston Committee this matter was under review by the Department
of Justice and I had not been released from my pledge on this
aspect. A similar answer was given to the question about what
was meant by the removal of restrictions on the use of surreptitious
entry of embassies io obiain cryptographic materials.
Mr. Johnson asked if I thought the Huston Committee had
been instigated by Bill Sullivan to more or less force Mr. Hoover
to take a more aggressive stance in intelligence collection. I
answered that I would not like to speculate on this and I could not
make a definite statement yes or no.
He asked why the Working Group met at CIA as opposed to
the FBI and whether this had special meaning. I answered that I
did not think so, that the US Intelligence Board was headed by the
Director of CIA, was concerned with intelligence collection and
met at CIA and also meeting arrangements could probably be better
arranged at CIA in view of parking, conference rooms, etc.
He said Admiral Gayler had stated that he and his predecessor,
Gen. Carter, had tried to get Mr. Hoover to provide more support to
NSA with regard to Communications Intelligence and asked if I was
aware of any such efforts, and if they were in person or in writing.
I said I was aware that Gen. Carter and Adm. Gayler had asked for
support and I believe they might have seen Mr. Hoover personally
and perhaps had written him.
