2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
MEMORANDUM FOR RECOD
OBJECT: Cuba
28 January 1963
Jele-
Spec.bep
minutes
The Executive Committee met on Friday, January 25th, and
approved the new policy as outlined by the Coordinator.
Dacisions bearing on covert operations were reached as follows:
1. The Special Group will have the responsibility of
continuing review of the program for infiltration of covert intelli-
xence agente. Progress will be regularly checked with the Group.
Higher authority made a particular point of saying that, although
the objective of 'intensified covert collection" is approved,
nonetheless, CIA should not feel it is under pressure to "get good
men killed" in the process. In other words, the advantages to be
gained from intensliled collection must be continually weighed
against the risks. This will be done by the Special Group.
2. The Attorney General expressed great interest in the
extent to which key members of the Brigade will be brought into
planning and current operations. He thought that they should be
thoroughly consulted on plans for intelligence teams and he indicated
that he will personally keep an eye on progress in this regard.
3. The use of propaganda balloons was disapproved at this
time. It apparently was not clear as to exactly how far CIA should
go in maintaining its current capability for launching balloons.
******
At Mr. Bundy's suggestion I had a long talk with Cottrell on
Saturday, the 26th. We discussed in particular the method of operation
with the Brigade. I pointed out some of the security aspects that
would have to be watched, but expressed the opinion that a workable
method of operation could be devised so that the Brigade leaders
could provide motivation and could feel a sense of participation,
without having to bring them so closely into the details of target
areas, dispatch, commo, etc., as to constitute a security hazard.
I cited the Agency's experience with the NTS as a possible guideline
in this regard. We agreed that after Mr. PitzGerald returns from
Panama, about the first of February, the three of us should discuss
this matter further.

SUBJECT: Minutes of Meeting of the Special Group, 8 February 1963
PRESENT: Mr. Bundy, Mr. Gilpatric, Mr. McCone, Mr. Hilsman,
and Mr. FitzGerald
1. Agent Operations in Cuba
Mr. FitzGerald discussed with the Group the CIA paper of
6 February which recommends a total of five maritime infiltration/
exfiltration operations during the next thirty days.
He emphasized that these black operations are entirely of an
intelligence nature and that they should be viewed only as a
supplement to intelligence coverage accomplished by other means.
In the latter connection, the point was made that information ob-
tained by agents of this type can contribute to the targeting of
aerial reconnaissance sorties and can assist in making the process
of photo interpretation more meaningful..
Mr. FitzGerald also emphasized that the teams now proposed
are comprised of only one to three agents. He noted that the agents
available are particularly well motivated, and that those whose
primary motivation was toward action rather than intelligence have
been weeded out.
The consensus of the Group was that while agent operations of
this type cannot be considered as a primary or major source of
intelligence, nonetheless this type of operation is consistent
with U.S. objectives in the Cuba situation and that approval of
these five should be recommended.
(These missions were approved by higher authority, 9 February
1963)

was approved at the meeting of 31 January 1963. He said that Agency
funds on deposit with the Morgan Guaranty, which will serve as
collateral against the bank's loan to the new entrepreneur of this
newspaper, would draw interest at 4%, while the purchaser will pay
the commercial rate of 6%. The Chairman expressed satisfaction
with this arrangement: 9.

SUBJECT: Minutes of Meeting of the Special Group, 28 February 1963
PRESENT: Mr. Bundy, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Gilpatric, and Mr. McCone
Colonel Steakley was present for Items 1-3
Reconnaissance - DOD Monthly Forecast
The Group had no objection to the BOW TIE missions as planned.
Mr. McCone alluded, however, to the unexplained military activity
that is going on in eastern China, and asked about the capability of
BOW TIE to check on this. It was pointed out that the BOW TIE
program consists of comparatively shallow penetration which would
probably not reach the kind of military target Mr. McCone had in mind.
Accordingly, Colonel Steakley was asked to confer with COMOR to find
out whether requirements exist for deeper penetration in the area,
and if so to bring in an appropriate proposal to the Special Group.
In connection with project AMOS, Mr. Johnson read a message from
Lord Home to the Secretary of State. Home said that while the RAF
and the Air Ministry will be glad to have the advantage of the
intelligence resulting from the mission, nonetheless this represents
a departure from the previous pattern of flights in the area.
Additionally, the flight will, according to Home, go closer to the
coast than the RAF is allowed to go. He was willing to agree to the
mission, provided it was not viewed as establishing a precedent, and
on the stipulation that Secretary Rusk personally accepts the risk
entailed. Mr. Johnson said that Secretary Rusk is willing to accept
this risk.
The Group approved AMOS, subject to check by Mr. Bundy with
higher authority, and on the understanding that the Group will have
a chance to take a last look at it shortly before the scheduled date
of 19 March. Colonel Steakley was also asked to report to the Group
on the results of the mission. (This mission was later approved by
higher authority.)
In this connection, Mr. McCone commented on the great importance
of obtaining intelligence on the Soviet low-level SA-3 system. The
Group agreed that thisis a high-priority requirement, in order to
to]

provide a basis for estimating accurately the chances for successful
Tow-level penetration of the USSR. Mr. McCone will arrange to have
a USIB paper prepared on this subject.
The Group noted the DESOTO destroyer voyage, which will now in-
clude a courtesy call at Djakarta.
Colonel Steakley told the Group that CINCLANT has tried out the
MELON PATCH photography missions, operating under the ten mile re-
striction which was laid on by the Special Group at its meeting of
31 January. It is now apparent to CINCLANT that adequate photography
of the desired areas cannot be obtained at that distance.
agreed that the ten mile restriction should remain in force. In
coming to this conclusion they made the point that in case of real
need for this type of coastal intelligence, there would be adequate
time to obtain it after an emergency actually was in effect; and
further, any such information collected now would have to be up-dated
before operations could be mounted based on it.
The revised RED DOG missions, to be flown in C-47's, and the
proposal to fly some BRASS KNOB missions from the Canal Zone, were
approved.
Colonel Steakley was asked to give the Group a report on the
results obtained from the last mission into the Sea of Okhotsk.
Colonel Steakley told the Group that the JCS will make no
recommendation on low-level coverage of Laos (ABLE MABEL) until after
the results of the Agency effort explained below.
The Group made a point of saying that although the time is not
now propitious for covering the COMOR priority targets in Cuba with
low-level flights, it may well prove desirable to do this on fairly
short notice. Therefore this matter should be kept under constant
review by operating elements.

Reconnaissance - CIA Monthly Forecast
Mr. McCone told the Group that the weather has suddenly opened

Laos, which was approved by the Special Group on 17 January, will
actually be launched tonight. He said that after this is completed
the airplane will be ferried to Taiwan in accordance with the dis-
cussion at the meeting of the 25th of February, transiting Laos on
the way. Mr. McCone also reported on the recent successful GROSBEAK
mission.

3. Removal of Soviet Troops
98
Mr. McCone said that we still do not know very much about the
removal of Soviet troops from Cuba. Mr. Bundy stated that the
official government position is that available information is in-
sufficient to justify any change in the estimated figures of Soviets
on the island. He added that no change can be made in these figures
without specific approval by higher authority.7
4. Testimony on Cuba
Mr. McCone commented on the difficulties encountered by
officials who are required to testify before Congressional committees
on the Cuban situation, in light of the propensity of these committees
to question witnesses on statements made by other officials. Mr.
Bundy recognized that this is a problem and said that in an attempt
to alleviate it he has had several documents brought together. These
include a compendium of the President's remarks on the subject; the
DCI's report to the Killian Committee; a report by Assistant Secretary
Martin; and most recently, the CIA-prepared paper on subversion in
the hemisphere. He added that the basic responsibility for co-
ordinating public statements rests with the Secretary of State.
5. Italy - Status Report on Election Operation
98
The Group noted that this project is progressing, but is still
in its early stages.7

6. Chile - Proposed Political Action
The Group approved the proposal dated 25 February, subject to
approval by higher authority. (This was later granted.)7
7. Agency Operations in Latin America 98
Mr. Gilpatric inquired as to the feasibility of mounting
intelligence or other operations against selected military personnel
in Latin America. Mr. McCone said that some of this is being done
but that he will have it studied further.
8. Progress on Cuban Operations
Mr. McCone told the Group that none of the five agent operations
approved by the Group on the 8th of February has been successful.
He noted that there have been a number of aborts due to weather,

failure of equipment, and failure of rendezvous plans. He said
that efforts are continuing to carry out these operations success-
fully, but indicated some unhappiness with the results to date and
the prospects of success. He alluded particularly to the qualities
of the agent personnel.

PRESENT: Mr. Bundy, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Gilpatric, and Mr. McCone.
Dr. Scoville, Mr. McMillan, and Colonel Steakley were
present for Items 1-5.
Mr. Lundahl was present for Item 1.
Mr. FitzGerald was present for Item 5.
Low-Level Reconnaissance, Cuba
In connection with the USIB recommendation for resumption of
low-level coverage of Cuba, Mr. Lundahl showed the Group examples
of the additional information that can be obtained from low-level
photography as contrasted with high-level coverage. This had to do
particularly with identification of materiel, spotting of personnel,
etc.
Mr. McCone emphasized that low-level coverage would give us
additional information on the numbers of Soviet troops and possibly
on Soviet intentions, and similar subjects, but that it would not
represent a qualitative shift in the body of intelligence available.
It would not reveal anything that would be of major security interest
to the U.S. and which could not be picked up by high-level coverage.
Mr. McCone also referred to the progress of certain negotiations
which have been holding up active consideration of low-level photo-
graphy. He said that there are differences of opinion among people
closest to this situation as to what the effect of resumption of such
photography actually might be on the negotiations.
Mr. Gilpatric said that Defense is not convinced of the urgency
of this proposition and would not favor it at this time, unless others
feel that there is an overriding political reason for undertaking the
project. He said that he would prefer to see this capability reserved
for identifying the type of threat that we might otherwise not be
aware of, or used at a time when there was some political advantage to
be gained by low-level flights.7

Mr. Johnson said that the Secretary of State does not believe
that there is any foreign policy reason for mounting the operation
at this time, and in fact the Secretary and other high officials in
the Department feel that from a policy point of view it would be
inadvisable now.
The Group then agreed that the resumption of low-level coverage
would not be recommended at this time, but that it would be kept
under weekly review.
98
Reconnaissance, Indonesia
The Group noted the intelligence justification for this proposal
and the political objections to it, and the Chairman agreed to discuss
it with higher authority as an example of a situation where clear-cut
differences of interest exist. He said that if there was any doubt
from that quarter he would have all the principals participate in
further discussion with higher authority.

3. Peripheral Reconnaissance Operations
(The proposal was later
98
Colonel Steakley gave the following brief reports on a
number of peripheral missions:
(1) The ELINT coverage of the Sea of Okhotsk produced good
results. He said that this area is now so well covered with
radars that consideration should probably be given as to whether
the rules requiring an abort in case of an Al lock-on should be
relaxed.
(2) The AMOS mission, directed against SA-3's in the
Baltic, did not result in any ELINT take from the radars
associated with the SA-3's. He said that some question now
arises as to whether these weapons are in fact SA-3's or
perhaps a later generation of the SA-2.
(3) A DESOTO destroyer mission off the Soviet Maritime
Provinces resulted in Soviet instructions to shut down their
radars when the ship approached.
b. The Group approved four missions (UNA, DANIEL, FLOYD and
GEORGE) using new ASD-1 equipment. This includes two in the Baltic
area, one in the Black Sea, and one flying from England to the Black
Sea.

4. ELINT Balloons
98
Dr. Scoville gave the Group details of the operation in the
Sea of Japan, employing balloons against TALL KING radars. He said
that the results indicate that perhaps these radars are not as
efficient as we had thought, but that further analysis is proceeding.7
5. Covert Operations, Cuba
a. Procedures
Noting that the shipping sabotage paper of 19 March had
not been considered by the Cottrell committee as a body, the Special
Group asked that such proposals be considered in that way before
submission to the Special Group. In passing the recommendations to
the Special Group it should be indicated what the position of the
various Cottrell members was, just as is done in the case of political
projects coordinated with State and the ambassador. Each member of
the Cottrell committee would see to it that his own agency staffed
the paper in the normal way for submission to the Special Group.
b. Sabotage of Shipping
The substance of the 19 March paper was then considered.
Mr. McCone raised a question as to exactly what the U.S. objective
now is in this and related fields, and questioned in addition whether
we may be trying to manage exile groups too closely..
There was some discussion as tothe actual value of carrying
out the proposed sabotage, that is whether enough damage could be
done to hurt the Castro regime seriously. The consensus of the Group
seemed to be that activity of this kind should not be undertaken if
it could be expected to yield only small gains, but that if its
effect would be really significant then that would be a different
matter.
Considerable doubt was expressed about the proposal for
sinking and setting fire to ships. None of the members felt that
there was any particular objection to the use of abrasives or other
damaging materials.
The proposal was then remanded for group consideration by
the Cottrell committee. This committee is asked to look at the pro-
posal in relation toeeverything else that is going on or is under
serious consideration, in order to assess its true potentiality.
Mr. FitzGerald was authorized to modify the proposal to the extent
EYES ONLY

Утс

SECRET

of considering possible unilateral action as opposed to using an
exile group as a cutout. Mr. Bundy will explore exactly what the
feeling of higher authority is with respect to relations with exile
groups.
c. Additional Programs
Mr. Johnson mentioned the activities of the NTS, which has
been broadcasting in Russian to the Soviet troops over Radio Caribe
in the Dominican Republic. Mr. FitzGerald agreed to add this to the
possibilities listed under radio broadcasting.
Mr. Johnson questioned the extent to which proposition b.,
involving inciting Cubans to commit aggressive acts against Soviet
personnel, is in accord with current objectives.
On the matter of propaganda balloons, most members of the
Group felt that these might be useful in connection with the particular
target mentioned - the May Day concentration which is expected in Havana.
Mr. Johnson had some reservations which he wanted to check out further
in the Department. It was agreed that should State take a favorable
view, then the matter would be presented to higher authority.
As to the request for Defense training facilities, Mr.
Gilpatric asked that Mr. FitzGerald discuss the needs with Secretary
Vance. Mr. FitzGerald said that the principal requirement which can-
not be met in CIA facilities is adequate space for weapons training.
Members of the Group recalled that the objection to the use of Defense
facilities at the time it was presented during the MONGOOSE period,
was that this would make it difficult, if not impossible, to deny
official U.S. involvement. Mr. Bundy said that he saw no objection
if the purpose was to train Cubans for eventual open hostilities, but
thought that in this case the objective might be better achieved by
having them undergo regular U.S. Army training. The other members
agreed.

All members of the Group expressed their interest in getting on
with plans for resuming FALCON missions. It was noted that one of the
principal problems in this area is the question of a base. It was
agreed that we should probably approach this from the point of view
of obtaining a standby agreement with the Indian Government to permit
staging in and out of that country. Dr. Scoville said that a message
had gone out to the field on this point last night. The Chairman
asked that word be sent to the Ambassador that high-level interest
in this proposition does exist in Washington.

CIA's paper of 1 April was noted.
Low-Level Reconnaissance, Cuba
The Group took no action on this subject.
Covert Subsidy for Kong Le
At Mr. Hughes' suggestion, it was agreed that CIA should look into

memorandum from the Deputy Coordinator, 2 April 1963.
b. Russian Language Broadcasts, 2 April 1963.

Reconnaissance, Northern Laos
It was agreed that the proposal for this coverage, which was
contained in the NRO paper of 4 April and which was deferred last
week, should be approved.
Mr. McCone mentioned the difficulties which have arisen with
Sarit, noting particularly that he is unwilling to give permission
for the renewed use of Takhli until certain Thai officials return
to Bangkok from Paris, which will be around the 20th of this month.
Mr. McCone mentioned the possibility of basing the aircraft in the
Philippines or Taiwan, if the Takhli possibility should fall through
completely.
The DCI said that if it proves impossible to mount missions
designed to cover the Sino-Indian border, then three will be required
for Laos and North Vietnam. If on the other hand the Sino-Indian
missions are run, then only two additional ones would be required to
cover Laos and North Vietnam, since some of the area could be covered
in the process of the Sino-Indian coverage.
Mr. Bundy will clear these proposals with higher authority.
Coverage of Sino-Indian Border Area
Dr. Scoville reported on the difficulties encountered in ob-
taining Indian approval for staging aircraft through that country,
stressing the fact that the chief of the intelligence service will
not be available in India until the 16th of this month, and no
decision can be expected before then. He said that the time before
the onset of the monsoon season is getting short. Dr. Scoville said
that efforts are continuing to get staging approval from the Indians,
as well as approval from the Thais to base in Takhli.

Inadvertent Overflights by Reconnaissance Aircraft
Colonel Steakley distributed a memorandum listing the four
inadvertent overflights of Soviet territory by U.S. reconnaissance
aircraft, since January 1961.
He commented that in previous years the rate of such incidents
was considerably higher. Mr. Bundy asked him to provide for the Group
in the next week or so a recapitulation of such incidents, going back
to approximately 1949.
Colonel Steakley said that both CINCPAC and the Joint Reconnais-
sance Group believe that the incident of 10 April, when an ELINT
aircraft flew over one of the Kuriles, appears to represent a violation
of established procedures and instructions. CINCPAC has asked for
a full report.
Mr. McCone questioned the efficacy of the system of advising
Special Group members of such incidents. Colonel Steakley said that
a procedure has been specified and he undertook to provide a copy to
Mr. Parrott for the information of the Group. He said that he would
take special measures tomake sure that these instructions are followed.
Cuban Operations
Mr. FitzGerald expanded orally on the paper of 9 April, giving
a summary of the recent results in the agent infiltration program,
and outlining proposals in this field for the next month. The Group
approved this projection. In response to a question about the status
of Manolo Ray's people, Mr. FitzGerald said that CIA was in touch with
him from time to time, and that any plan he has to offer for activity
against Cuba will be sympathetically received, but that he has not to
date come up with any such proposal.
The comments from the Coordinator of Cuban Affairs, dated 11 April,
on the three papers being considered at today's meeting were noted.
The Group requested that these comments be withdrawn and destroyed
for security reasons. With specific reference to the comment that a
proposed sabotage action should not be carried out on the target date
of the 20th or 21st of April, Mr. FitzGerald pointed out that this date
had been set before the status of the Donovan negotiations was known.
He said that of course no activity of this kind would be allowed to
interfere with those negotiations at this stage.
There then ensued a lengthy discussion of the entire question of
sabotage. The Group agreed that the papers before it were responsive
to requests which had been levied on CIA to come up with general and
specific proposals. On the other hand, all members of the Group
recognized that a searching examination must be undertaken in the light

of all pertinent factors, to determine whether we wish to change the
present policy. It was agreed that in order to provide a firm basis
for judgment, we must get a clearer picture of capabilities, of the
prospects of success, the extent of benefits to be gained from
successful operations, the dangers of repercussions and of reprisals,
etc., etc.
With respect to external operations to be mounted by exile groups,
it was agreed that this sort of activity poses a real dilemma.
Particularly in view of the recently-enunciated policy toward exile
raids, it becomes increasingly difficult to disavow plausibly
responsibility for such acts. The U.S. is thus placed in the position
of either appearing to be ineffective in controlling the exiles or
of bearing the onus of active involvement in the operations.
Mr. McCone expressed great skepticism about the desirability of
proceeding with sabotage operations, to include training, until an
over-all policy is made clear on steps to be taken to assure the re-
moval of Soviet troops and on the problem of Castro. He also com-
mented on the ineffectiveness of Cuban agents and the fact that they
would undoubtedly talk if captured. Mr. FitzGerald confirmed the
second point, but felt that these particular Cubans are perhaps more
effective than the usual run.
It was decided that probably Friday, the 19th of April, a pre-
sentation should be made to higher authority at which time all
responsible individuals should have an opportunity to express their
views. A paper will be prepared, outlining: a proposed broad program
for sabotage as well as examples of specific operations; a sense of
the scale of activity which could reasonably be expected and the
benefits from it; an estimate of what could be achieved by the use of
internal assets; possible repercussions; and how such activity would
fit into overall policy. CIA is to coordinate with State in the
preparation of this paper.
Annexes to Internal Defense Plans
The Colombia annex was noted. In view of the fact that the
basic IDP for Bolivia had earlier been remanded for revision by the
Special Group (CI), the covert annex for that country was held over
until the overt plan is considered by the CI Group.
North Vietnam Operations
The monthly report was noted and approved.

He noted that Secretary Vance does not particularly like this pro-
position because of the possibility that the explosions would be
attributed to torpedoes. While recognizing the validity of Mr.
Vance's argument, Mr. Gilpatric felt that this risk was acceptable.
The Chairman summed up the preliminary reactions of the Group to
the proposals as follows:
a. The proposition for dealing with selected exile groups
is a good one, but the method of dealing with them will have to be
more carefully defined.
b. There is no objection to limpets, subject to further
technical studies.
c. Surface attacks on Cuban ships do not appear particularly
attractive, nor do shore-based attacks of a similar nature.
d. Externally mounted hit-and-run attacks against land
targets appear worthwhile. The operations in this category which
can be run in May, will be discussed with higher authority. Refineries
and power plants seem to be particularly good targets. Operations
of this kind will be especially valuable if done in conjunction with
other resistance activities.
e. Internal resistance should be stimulated, again in
conjunction with related operations.
Covert Action, Congo
The CIA paper of 19 April was approved with little discussion.
The Chairman said that his only concern was whether we are committed
to spending money at this rate forever. Mr. Tweedy said first that
if the Adoula government should fall, it would probably be in the
U.S
