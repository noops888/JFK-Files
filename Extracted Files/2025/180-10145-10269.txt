Subject:
Suitability of Manuel Ray and Miro Cardona for Important
Roles in a Possible New Cuban Government

Information received from Dr. Robert North Professor of Political Science of
29 at Stanford University anu long-time source of exceptional value. North
visited in Miami and contacted about 25 former Castro supporters representing
a broad political gamut. Dr. North) got the impression from many of the
of Cubans that they suspectea Ray of being a "possible Communist sleeper".
North Treluctant to pass along this information, because accusations were
very broad.
2. Infomation report dated 16 July 1962 and Earlier
Source: Cuban National (Alien File A-12570921) who asked for an
interview on occasion of first contact with CIA.
Cannot vouch for his bona fides. Had credential indicating membership in
branch of revolutionary army's intelligence service, now in exile in U.S.
and maintaing connections with colleagues in that country.
A friend of his reports plans to assassinate top Castro leadership in Cuba.
To be done by poison -- "Clostridium Botulinum" which is strong, odorless,
and tasteless. Takes about 12 days to kill. About 5cc would do the job.
Waiting for next visit of major delegation from a Communist country
dinner in honor of the occasion should bring together most of the important
members of the regime and that is when the attempt will be made.

Branch from Daniels. Source is Ernesto Dezaldo Cuban lawyer now
living in New York City. Stated the MRP in Havana is far less radical than
under the leadership of Ray, who has been completely discredited in recent
months. Primary purpose today is (a) assassination of top leaders in Castro
regime and (B) sabotage of important industrial and government installations
in Havana. Strength of MRP in Havana estimated to exceed 1,000

Comments on Post-invasion Cuba. Reporting officer talked with
ISIDRO BORJA, on the leaders of DRE. Borja says top DRE members in jail
or in a friendly embassy in Havana but said new leaders have been selected
and will resume sabotage activities shortly. Thought the underground could
restore tension in Cuba in 3-4 months. However, said outside help needed
to get rid of Castro. Claimed that prior to invasion, is was possible to
buy almost anything in Cuba from Castro officials -- they were tainted by
corruption. Since Castro's victory at Bay of Pigs, his popular support is
estimated to be around 30-85%. Most support is out of fear because the
people believe he will be in power permanently. Borja said DRE outside of
Cuba working hard for release of former leader, Alberto Muller from prison.

Hal Hendrix, Scripps-Howard L.A. correspondent believes NY Times publicity
buildup for Ray in full swing. Tad Szulc reporting Ray's war movements from
Miami. Also with Szulc is close friend, Henry Raymont of the Times.
Hendrix said Times playing up Ray while downplaying Artime and Gutierrez
Menoyo. Think's Times exaggerating Ray's plans to take teams of highly
trained guerrillas into Cuba, and that Ray's "war" is little more than an
MGM-type New York Times production so far.

dividends. Family to arrive circa September 1960.

i
Increasing suspicion RAUL CHIBAS a Castro plant. Since exfiltration by
KAPPES, CHIBAS has laid low but back in picture as representative of RAY.
Common knowledge that CHIBAS brought KAPPES out of Cuba, but should be
noted that KAPPES has since been in and out of Cuba three times with
no apparent difficulties.
CHIBAS sources of information:
Mason in U. S. government
Manuel de Jesus and Bender as FRD representatives
Nino Diaz as Alianza representative
Don Hogan Kappes as Alberto Fernandex representative.
This should get a good picture of the U.S. anti-Castro activities.
3. Summer 1960. Ray very actively recruited to become FRD member.
CIA considered him an important political asset. RAUL CHIBAS, Ray's
assistant, spoke for him with U.S. authorities. Urged strong organization
inside Cuba before outside help could be effective. CHIBAS meets with
Bender 9/7/60, says he is in favor of FRD but completely committed to
Ray and would check with him.

in FRD and State desired to look further into his background. Ray was
discussed again on 9/27/60 with Mr. Divine who further conferred with
Ambassador Mallory same day and Mallory approved Ray's inclusion.

*15. 11/17/60 Cable to Director from MASH
On 11/15/60, Parlett alias Bender met with Ray in complete privacy.
"Unquestionably, the youthful, softspoken, unassuming, almost humide Ray
is a natural leader of highest intellect, deepest sincerity and convistion."
Ray's political posture doubtful as far as U.S. government acceptance is
concerned.
Explained to Ray the U.S. government's desire to have all Cuban exiles
unified in their efforts. Ray says MRP does not wish to reinstate 1940
constitution. Provisional government of 30 honorable Cubans would be
established and elections held 18 months thereafter. Castro laws passed
at beginning of his regime to be promulgated. State would regulate
private investment and utilities would be nationalized.
Ray wants to keep MRP "lean and hungry" -- each member to have specific
responsibilities and feel important to revolution.
Ray asked for permission to start a fund drive in Cuba and U.S. Also
asked for $10,000 by next Wednesday -- Bender made commitment.
03
Parlett believes net result of meeting was establishment of private MRP-
U.S. link and door remains open for some kind of relationship with FRD.
Ray agrees to discuss this with Miro Cardona. Of all the groups being
supported, FRD, MRP and MRR are most significant. All Cuban groups seem
to be looking to Bender group to show a preference before joining one of
the above three. How long current flexibility can be maintained is
problematical.
16. 11/21/60 Memo for Record
Subject: Meeting with King and Esterline on subject of handling
MRP, 11/18/60
Consensus was that Ray did not politically represent anything to cheer
about. Writer felt MRP opposed to joining FRD and recognized need to
control MRP and wean it away to the extent possible from its leaders.
Could be done by controlling financial and military support. It was
agreed in meeting with Mr. Barnes that financial and military support
for MRP be channelled through FRD.
17. 11/23/60 Contact Report: Meeting with Ray and Chibas in NYC, 11/22/60
Ray says MRP has contacts at Isle of Pines with two garrisons and can
expect about 750 men to desert Castro at proper time. CAPTAIN CAPOTA is
contact with Ray's group.
Ray's people also in contact with commander of prison where Huber Matos
is incarcerated. Matos believes PADILLA, the prison commander, would assist

him in an escape. Ray interested in single operation to get military
defectors and free Matos. Wants to effect plan on 11/27/60.
Ray wants assistance from U.S. -- military information and supplies.
18. 11/24/60 Cable to Director from JMASH
Meeting with AMCHIRP-1 on 11/23, revealed he had information that MRP in
Havana had capabilities to blow up power plant and TV stations in Havana --
a diversionary tactic planned to coordinate with Isle of Pines operation.
Ray expects Isle of Pines operation support about 12/15/60.
Notation about Cable: "Operation Unity" is to create dramatic show which
will demonstrate that Manolo Ray is wrong when telling contacts in U.S.
that his group is the only one capable of action."
19. 11/24/60 Cable to Director from Havana.
Operation Unity involves MRR, MDI, OA, 30th of November Group and MAR (not
MAR of PEPIN RIVERO).
MAR and OA groups to blow electric cables in Regla area. MDC group, at
same time, to make assassination attempt on CARLOS RAFAEL RODRIGUEZ at
University of Havana.

JULIO ANGEL METRE advised planning to travel to Miami 12/1/60 escorted by

Conversation with Jose Miro Cardona and Berle, reveals that Cardona has
misgivings about Ray and Pazoz and the MRP. Says Ray is bitterly anti-
American as well as probably totalitarian in his thinking. He no longer
believes Ray has any considerable support inside Cuba. Thinks Ray group
endeavoring to exercise influence in our government so as to be the major
recipient of whatever assistance can be obtained here. He is particularly
