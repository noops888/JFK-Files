A source, who has furnished reliable information
in the past, advised during February, 1972, that Davida Fineman,
a member of the pro-Chinese communist, Marxist-Leninist
Revolutionary Union, advised during February, 1972, that she
continues to be in occasional contact with the individual known
to your Agency under the cryptonym "Sugar," and she refuses to
believe that this individual is employed as an operative of
your Agency. Fineman stated that she is also in contact with
Rene Raindorf, pro-Chinese communist Marxist-Leninist of Belgium.
Fineman indicated she was familiar with Roger Padgett
(phonetic) who has served as a professor at Cornell University
and at the University of Colorado at Boulder. The same source
indicated that he too was acquainted with Padgett (phonetic)
and that Padgett (phonetic) had admitted to the source he had
worked for your Agency as an advisor to former President Sukarno
of Indonesia for six years (S)
Fineman also volunteered that Gloria Steinem,
prominent Women's Liberation advocate, was employed by your
Agency. (S)
The above is for your information, and no further
dissemination is being made by this Bureau.

The following information was furnished by a
confidential source abroad on February 4, 1972:
SORM SPRMACIGAT
(JFK)
According to the source, a pro-Palestinian organization
called the Palestine Committee-Brussels was organized during
1970 within the Belgian National Palestine Committee for the
purpose of supporting Palestinian revolutionary activities.
The Brussels Committee was headed by Luc Dupire, a Belgian
national born on April 9, 1942, at Haine St. Paul, and the
National Palestine Committee by Aron Raindorf, a Belgian citizen
born on December 22, 1919, at St. Gilles.
Following a period during which the two groups
worked in harmony, a schism took place in November, 1971, which
resulted in a new group being formed by Dupire and Yvonne Sterck
which was called The Responsible Group for the National
Palestinian Committee and the Palestinian Committee-Brussels
without other members of either group being consulted. Raindorf,
according to the source, is currently attempting to regain
control over divergent elements and to restore order to the
groups involved.
In this connection, Raindorf traveled to London where
he remained from December 26 through December 28, 1971, and
met with one Gibson, described only as an American Negro journalist
and with an individual known as Manchanda, described as being
of Pakistani origin. The source indicated Manchanda is probably
identical to Albert Manchanda, a British citizen born on
April 9, 1919, in India. Raindorf also traveled to Beirut,
Lebanon, on January 20, 1972, and to Damascus, Syria, to meet
with elements of the Fath and the O.L.P. which were not further
described by the source.

The "New York Times" on 3/24/61, in an article entitled
"US Asks Court Bar Questions On Castro Foes in Miami Area", by Peter
Kihss, reported that an unidentified US agency had intervened in a
murder trial in Miami asking that questions about activities by Cubans
in that area seeking the overthrow of Premier Fidel Castro of Cuba be
barred in the trial. The article stated that the above intervention
became known while the FPCC called for a Congressional investigation of
CIA. Richard Gibson, acting national secretary of the FPCC, said he
based his call on an announcement of a "Revolutionary Council" set up
by the two major anti-Castro groups in Miami. Gibson said there had
been reports of CIA support of an anti-Castro enterprise and that forces
had been using Florida as a training and staging point for attacks
against Cuba. He said that reckless CIA action could lead the country
into a major war.

The State Department advised that on 1/10/63, March Schleifer,
an American Marxist and journalist, provided information pertaining
to the formation of "Revolutionary Africa (RA)", a magazine which was
an organ of the Politbureau in Algeria. The editor of the English
language section was to be Richard Gibson. Schleifer had worked with
Gibson in the FPCC movement but had lost some of his confidence in
Gibson as a true revolutionary after the latter "jumped" at a bureaucratic
position with the Politbureau. Schleifer had lived with Gibson in
Algiers and regarded him as the same type of man that Djilas (not
further identified) had denounced in "The New Class" (not further
identified). Gibson's position with the Maspero (not further identified)
group, and thus the FLN (not further identified), predated his
involvement in Cuban affairs. Schleifer pointed out that long before
the Cuban revolution, Gibson had been working in France with the French
"neo-Marxist" left. He had considerable editorial ability and should
have been an asset to "RA"

The following references in the file captioned "Lee Harvey
Oswald" set forth information pertaining to the activities of Richard
Thomas Gibson during the period March, 1960 through 12/9/63, in New
York, Algeria, Cuba, France and Switzerland. Gibson, a journalist,
had been head of the FPCC in the US and reportedly was a possible link
between the FPCC and the Chinese communists. He worked as a journalist
in Cuba and later in Algeria where he reportedly worked for the
Algerian Government.
From a reported conversation between Gibson and
another individual in Switzerland there appeared a possible indication
that Gibson had been acquainted with Oswald. Gibson was interviewed
at the American Embassy, Paris, where he stated that he had no
correspondence or knowledge of Oswald under the latter's full name.
However, he had received a letter from one Lee Bowmont who had
indicated an interest in organizing a FPCC in Ft. Worth, Texas, who
possibly was Oswald. Oswald allegedly had been connected with the
FPCC. The interviewer suspected that Oswald's pictures may have
looked familiar to Gibson.

The following references in the file captioned "Robert
Alexander Wood" set forth information pertaining to the activities of
Richard Gibson during the period late 1959 through 2/3/64, in the
United States, New York, Cuba, Europe, England, France, Switzerland
and Algeria. Wood provided information pertaining to Gibson beginning
with his first meeting in 1959 with Gibson when he offered his services
to the FPCC. Wood, accompanied by Gibson's wife, left the US for Algeria
where Gibson was editor of the publication "Revolution Africaine".
Wood lived with Gibson in Algeria. According to Wood, after Gibson arrived
in France he tried to get funds from the French CP without success
and was embittered against the "comrades". Wood did not believe Gibson
was a member of the CPUSA or any CP, but was an opportunist who rode
high on which ever cause he could find. He believed Gibson could have
been recruited for a good salary. Later Gibson was reportedly living
in Switzerland where he was active among pro-Chinese communist elements.
