2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
RELEASE IN FULL
2000
24 November, 1998
Memo for the Record
Subject: JFK Records Review Lessons Learned
The CIA's JFK Collection is made up primarily of
records pulled together for the Warren Commission, House
Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) and the
Assassinations Records Review Board (ARRB). It contains a
significant amount of duplication and non-JFK related
material. The current index is flawed and contains gaps.
Release standards were liberal; basically only source
identities and information, names of agents, employees under
cover, Agency locations and foreign liaison activities were
redacted. There is no evidence in the Collection to indicate
that the Warren Commission conclusions were wrong.
I. The JFK Act
Mandated review and declassification projects can be
two-edged swords. The JFK Act forced the Agency to review
records that should have been opened years ago. The legal
requirement to presume release, backed up by an independent
review, resulted in the opening of documents that clearly
would not have been released under other programs. However,
the Act and the Review Board created by the Act imposed un-
realistic deadlines, inflexible standards and procedures
which created a major drain on all Agency review resources
and had an over-all negative effect on the Agency's release
program.
Unrealistic Deadlines: The release dates set by the
Act did not take into account the start-up time and costs
(searches, inventorying and indexing) of a project of this
magnitude, nor the time it would then take for a page-by-
page review and sanitization of classified documents. For
example, initial indexing of the collection was done on a
crash basis using overtime employees and resulted in a
flawed database. The revising, re-indexing and updating of
that database took several thousand man-hours and continues
today."
Mandated Procedures: NARA's and ARRB's interpretation
of the law created a time-consuming, labor-intensive review
process that meant an inordinate amount of time was spent by
both the Agency and Board staff on issues which were
marginal to the story and to processing decisions by the
Board. For example:
a. Under the JFK Act every piece of paper in the
collection was considered a "unique" assassination record.
The result is a staggering amount of chaff and duplication.
13-00000
For example, one cable was files and processed 58 times in
the collection.
b. The ARRB required that all sanitized documents be
reviewed by the Board and that each postponement (deletion)
be acted on individually. Even after the Board changed
procedures and accepted staff recommendations instead of
reviewing each document, the detailed tracking, recording
and coding of every deletion within each document required
processing resources well beyond what would be considered
reasonable for such a project. A most sanitized documents
contained multiple deletions (one contained more than 1600
deletions and many over 100).
Inflexible Standards: The level of evidence required
by the Board to postpone what was generally considered
protectable information was extremely high and usually
required documentation of “current harm". Defenses based on
general principles such as official cover or sources and
methods were not acceptable. This required the Agency to
dedicate significant resources to prepare evidence to
support recommended postponements. Again, much time was
spent on issues that were marginal to the JFK story. For
example, several major evidence packages involving several
offices and presentations by senior agency officers and
officials were needed to secure Board agreement to protect
Agency physical locations and names of employees and other
persons not related to the JFK story.
Three times during the six years of the project, including
most of this past year, the JFK review effectively shut down
all other aspects of the Historical Review Program and had
to borrow additional resources from other offices and review
projects to meet deadlines. The JFK review will continue to
require a significant portion of HRP's resources through
FY99.
II. The Process
There are a number of basic lessons from the JFK review
that are applicable to other historical/systematic review
projects:
We need reviewers with broad Agency experience, which
can be either managerial or substantive.
We need to establish early on what information is
already in the public domain and address the issue of
"official release" in the context of each project.
Develop a strategy/policy with the IROs concerning the
release of information. Be smart about it; do not accept
stonewalling by them on relevant information that can be
released. At the same time, avoid confrontations with them
on marginal or non-relevant information.
On-site Directorate reviewers are the most effective
way to handle the internal coordination requirements of a
large project. Without the DO's JFK team on site it would
have been impossible to complete the JFK project.
Develop guidelines and processes for coordinating Third
Agency documents; include other agencies in discussions; do
not drop documents into the black hole of other agencies'
FOIA offices without this advance discussion.
Maintain written, up-to-date, project-specific
declassification guidelines. This is no small task. A
"declassification guide" must be flexible; no guide can
anticipate all the issues which will arise in a review.
After six years, we were still revising the JFK guidelines
in the last month of the project.
In establishing deadlines, allow sufficient time to do
a thorough, professional job as required by the project
activities (see Unrealistic Deadlines above).
Ensure we have adequate support people for routine
processing tasks; declassification involves both tough
substantive analysis--and a lot of routine processing.
If possible, inventory/index all materials before the
review and processing begins. Experienced indexers are a
must. Identification of duplicate documents should be a key
part of any inventory or index.

I. Background (1992-1995)
The setting up of the Historical Review Program by DCI
Gates in early 1992 coincided with growing interest in
Congress to require federal agencies to declassify records
related to the assassination of President Kennedy. DCI Gates
decided to start declassification process before Congress
passed legislation:
testified before Congress on 12 May 1992 about CIA`S
new openness policy and announced the declassification
of the first folder of Oswald's 201 (also known as the
pre-assassination file).
six boxes of the Oswald's 201 were reviewed and
transferred to NARA by Oct. 1992.
The John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection
Act of 1992 (JFK Act) was signed 26 October 1992:
it called for Presidential-appointed Assassination
Records Review Board composed of non-government
individuals;
established "a presumption of immediate disclosure"
for records relating to the assassination.
For first two years of its existence, the Historical
Review Program focused primarily on the review of JFK
assassination records:
there were two major releases of Agency records (August
1993 and August 1994) of approximately 227,000 pages;
joint HRG/DO teams reviewed additional assassination
related collections at National Archives (Warren
Commission), the SSCI (Church Committee and the Ford
Presidential Library (Rockefellow Commission) plus
numerous referrals from other federal agencies (FBI,
State, Army, etc.).
Due to delays in the appointment of its members and the
time required to hire and clear a staff, the ARRB did not
actually begin reviewing documents until May 1995. It became
clear in immediately that the ARRB would require the release
of far more information than the Agency had released in the
1992-94 review. In mid-1995 HRG began a re-review of the
previously released sanitized documents:
approximately 80% of the 227, 000 pages release in
1993-94 contained deletions
resources were taken from other projects and added
to JFK project to meet Board's monthly deadlines.
II. The JFK Act and the ARRB
Mandated review and declassification projects can be
two-edged swords. The JFK Act forced the Agency to review
records that should have been opened years ago. The legal
requirement to presume release, backed up by an independent
review, resulted in the opening of documents that clearly
would not have been released under other programs. However,
the Act and the Review Board created by the Act imposed un-
realistic deadlines, inflexible standards and procedures
which created a major drain on all Agency review resources
and had an over-all negative effect on the Agency's release
program.
Unrealistic Deadlines: The release dates set by the
Act did not take into account the start-up time and costs
(searches, inventorying and indexing) of a project of this

page review and sanitization of classified documents. For
example, initial indexing of the collection was done on a

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Information Review Group, OIM
FROM: Charles A. Briggs
JFK Declassification Project, OIM
SUBJECT: The JFK Declassification Experience
1. My assumption in preparing the attached is that
I was asked because: a) for seven-plus years I've been
involved in the project; and b) my past Agency assign-
ments, including being the first DO Information Review
Officer, gave me the opportunity to see declassification
from many vantage points: from a legalistic directorate-
oriented, either-or standpoint (taking full advantage of
allowed exemptions), to a "corporate" Agency-wide strategy
to foster credibility while protecting secrets that should
remain secret. My comments and conclusions reflect that
experience and do not necessarily reflect the views of HRP
management.
2. Historically, the Deputy Directors have not
paid much attention to information management unless
there's a problem. Then the approach has been: what went
wrong; who's to blame; how can we ensure that this doesn't
happen again; what lessons have we learned? What this JFK
experience reiterates is the need for a proactive, not just
reactive, flexible strategy, with corporate Agency direction
through the Deputies to their Information Review Officers.
And the IROS, who, in essence, determine credibility and
resource impact, should be supergrades, with experience
in at least two directorates. Because information release
has become a major management issue, the Executive Director
is the obvious officer to ensure consistent and informed
implementation of release policy.

SUBJECT: THE JFK DECLASSIFICATION EXPERIENCE
3. Considerable skepticism in the public, the media,
and, unfortunately, the Congress results from the in-house
conclusion that denial is justifiable in the absence of
"official acknowledgment" of Executive Branch information,
even though such information is already in the public
domain, from senior Agency officials' publications,
Congressional investigations, books by former Cabinet-level
NSC members, even Presidents. This inflexible legal
strategy may win the battle and lose the war. Lawsuits are
a lot more expensive than negotiation.
4. The Agency Task Force that in 1992 considered
some of the aspects of DCI Gates' "openness" philosophy
did not have the benefit of the JFK experience. I suggest
that a senior-level panel be established to consider an
objective look at the need for continued classification
of generic versus specific sources and methods information,
particularly that already in the public domain and when
dealing with matters of high public or historic interest.
HR 70-14, referring as it does in paragraph e. (4) to
"Guidelines for Declassification" in Executive Order 12356,
does not promote the tactical approach which is suggested
in the Comments section on page eight of the attached.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Information Review Group, OIM
FROM: Charles A. Briggs
JFK Declassification Project, OIM
SUBJECT: The JFK Declassification Experience
1. (AIUO) BACKGROUND: The impact of the JFK
declassification law on Agency resources and information
release decisions was dramatic and to the DO, traumatic. The
resource trauma stemmed from the unanticipated number of years
required to complete the project. In a memorandum for the DCI
dated 11 June 1993, the then-Director of the Center for the
Study of Intelligence outlined a plan for implementing the
"openness philosophy" espoused by both DCIs Gates and Woolsey
through a series of “Cold War Declassification" projects. He
noted that priority, by virtue of a Congressionally-mandated
deadline of 22 August 1993, had been given to declassification
of the JFK collection; however, he said, “with the end of the
JFK activity in sight," resources could be applied to the
other projects. Six years later (actually seven since the
project got underway), we are almost finished.
2. (AIUO) The substantive, versus administrative,
trauma stemmed from the fact that the JFK Act superseded
all other existing laws, including FOIA, the Privacy Act,
the DCI's authorities, as well as Executive Orders and
Regulations.1 The Act presumed release. It did allow for
appeal but only to the President from the DCI. It allowed
"postponements" but only if clear and convincing evidence
was presented for each requested postponement and that
release would demonstrably impair the national security.
The net effect was the release of names, crypts, pseudos,
methods, station locations (within specified dates), file
identifier numbers, and tradecraft generally, which are
protectable under the other laws and which the Agency had

learned to live with (See Appendix A for the Assassination
Records Review Board (ARRB) "Standards For Review” and “Key
Distinctions Between Those Under FOIA, Executive Order 12356
and the JFK Act,” with examples).
3. (U) Finally, a Presidentially-appointed
assassination review board (the ARRB) had the final say
both on postponement and on relevance, subject only to a
successful DCI appeal to the President. Although a few
appeals were considered, particularly in the early period,
none was made.
4. (U) The JFK Act called for each agency to review
and transfer its relevant material to NARA by 22 August 1993.
Thus, a significant set of materials was transferred from
CIA to NARA in 1993, reflecting CIA's then-current judgment
on the redactions permitted. Subsequent Board reviews and
ARRB staff inquiries resulted in the addition of material to
that original set of documents, as well as adjustments to the
original set, to reflect Board actions generally to release
more information. Although many documents have been adjusted
or added to the collection, requiring substantive HRG and DO
reviews as well as administrative actions, the net number of
pages in CIA'S JFK Collection at NARA is about 260,000.
SIZE AND NATURE OF THE COLLECTION
5. (U) The material requiring line-by-line review
included 17 boxes called the Oswald 201 File; 64 boxes called
the "Segregated Collection" File, containing those documents
made available to the House SubCommittee on Assassinations
(HSCA) during its 1978 investigation; 23 boxes of HSCA
referrals staff notes in longhand and type, draft sections
of the HSCA final report, correspondence on HSCA letterhead,
trip reports anything referred to us by the National
Archives (NARA) for review of possible Agency equities;
19 boxes called "The Holmes Collection" a reference
collection used by the then-DO focal point for FOIA and other
JFK queries, Russell Holmes; Presidential libraries material,
Church Committee and Rockefeller Commission testimonies,
National Security Council papers, PFIAB Minutes and other
Community papers made available through the ARRB staff; and
13 boxes called "Miscellaneous," including follow-on
questions from the ARRB, a previously overlooked Latin
American Division working file, DCI calendars, some DI/OCI
2
SECRET

SECRET
SUBJECT: The JFK Declassification Experience
"Dailies." Box 64 of the "Segregated Collection" consisted
of 72 reels of microfilm of complete files from which the
material reviewed by the HSCA staffers was drawn: CIA staff
personnel and security files; a duplicate Oswald 201 file;
26 reels of 201 files on Cubans, Russians, and Americans
linked with Oswald, the JFK assassination, and the several
investigations; DO project history files, and so on.
6. (AIUO) Included were printed text, almost illegible
Thermofax, photographs, computer listings, typed 3X5 cards,
buckslips, routing sheets, handwritten scraps every
imaginable form of documentation, with a tremendous amount
of duplication, in one instance, 54 copies of a Mexico City
cable. Every one of these pieces of paper had to be handled
according to NARA instructions, as a unique document for
inclusion in the NARA collection for public access and with
an Identification Aid for research assistance and retrieval.
Among other things, the collection reflected little attention
to procedures propounded by NARA itself for Records
Management, including destruction of duplicate copies.
7. (AIUO) The pressure to meet an initial Congress-
ionally-mandated release date of 22 August, 1993 with the
NARA-required Research Identification Forms, resulted in a
crash effort at indexing done, mainly, by individuals on
loan from the directorates on an overtime basis and generally
unfamiliar with the collection and the subject matter. Thus,
a major factor in inconsistent redacting of multiple copies
of the same document in different boxes was a function of the
quality of the indexing and the effort of the reviewers to
cope with constantly changing guidelines. Inadvertent
release was inevitable.
THE REVIEW PROCESS
8. (AIUO) The majority of the reviewers were
independent contractors with many years of experience,
in some cases senior management experience in at least two
directorates. Two HRG reviewers had been Information Review
Officers themselves as supergrades, one in the DO, the other
in the DA. After the HRG review with suggestions for release
in full or with redactions, the documents went to a DO review
team. The DO agreement or disagreement was reflected on each
document, and the package was returned for a senior-level HRP
review prior to forwarding to the ARRB.

SUBJECT: The JFK Declassification Experience
9. (AIUO) As complicated and frustrating as the
process was, it wouldn't have worked at all without the on-
site presence of the DO team with their link to DO/IMS and
the area divisions in Headquarters. Not surprisingly, the
DO Headquarters tended to use the familiar FOIA standards,
under which much more information could be withheld than was
defendable under the JFK law. A major part of the JFK story
was Oswald's trip to Mexico City; it took several months for
the DO to agree to allow acknowledgment of the existence of
a station in Mexico City and many more months to release the
name, pseudo, and tenure of the chief of station
information, except for the pseudo, long since in the public
domain.
10. (AIUO) Another long time debate concerned
acknowledgment of teltap and photo surveillance by the
Mexico City Station on the Soviet and Cuban embassies and
consulates both discussed in open literature but disguised
as unidentified sensitive source materials in the Warren
Commission report, along with a cropped photo and transcripts
of telephone conversations that came to the station from
somewhere. One issue, for a long time, was acknowledging
that the teltaps were station activities. The ARRB insisted
on nearly total release of Mexico City Station traffic,
history, personnel, and project approvals because Oswald's
trip to Mexico City remained one of the most controversial
conspiracy theory aspects of the JFK story. Proof of
Oswald's presence there, of his contact with the Soviet
and Cuban embassies and consulates, and the reasons
therefore, of the station's unfamiliarity with him prior
to the assassination became evident through release of the
detailed information on the teltap and photo operations.
11. (AIUO) After the ARRB staff received the Agency
reviewed material, discussion of the validity of the
deletions (the "postponements") occurred. In the early
stages there was a tendency for the Agency Information Review
Officers in the directorates to deny rather than release, to
test using FOIA standards until challenged, then back off.
In a couple of instances, assertions were made that the
information that the ARRB said should be released was so
sensitive that an appeal to the President would be made
it wasn't. The net result of the deny-until-pushed approach
was an absence of credibility, leading the ARRB to include
the following statement in its Final Report to the President
on 30 September 1998:
but

13-00000
SECRET
SUBJECT: The JFK Declassification Experience
"A small number of CIA staff officers, almost
exclusively in the Directorate of Operations,
unnecessarily impeded the process and damaged
the Agency's interests by resisting compromise
with all-or-nothing positions."
12. (AIUO) As time passed and both Agency and ARRB
staffers became better educated in attempting the balance
between the public interest and the legitimate need for
secrecy, credibility improved, the ARRB members delegated
the negotiation process to the staff. Previously, every
postponed word, phrase, or paragraph had to the approved
by the Board. Toward the end, only remaining disagreements
were passed by the staff to the Board.
THE ISSUE OF RELEVANCE
13. (AIUO) The ARRB, under the law, determined
relevance of file material eventually quite successfully,
although it could and did, negotiate. Because of the
impact of the Oliver Stone movie “JFK," reflecting a 70-80% public view that the Warren
Commission conclusion that Oswald acted on his own was wrong,
the ARRB pursued all the major conspiracy theories. Thus,
Agency files on the USSR's handling of American defectors,
entry and departure controls on foreigners, alien employment
and marriage with Soviet citizens, and, particularly, KGB
interest in Oswald, and Nosenko's claim to have reviewed
Oswald's KGB file in Moscow were declared relevant as was
the whole Nosenko bona fides issue. Agency contact with the
Mafia to arrange for Castro's assassination, not known to the
Warren Commission, were obviously relevant and, by extension,
assassination as an Agency activity was considered relevant
hence, all such testimony before the Church Committee had to
be reviewed. Of particular interest was the plot against
Lumumba because of the involvement of the former Chief of the
Technical Services Division, which division was also involved
in the Castro assassination planning.
14. (U) The major conspiracy theory of interest
to the Board concerned Cubans: either alleged Castro
involvement because of his awareness of plotting against
himself or Cuban exiles, furious with JFK for the Bay of Pigs
failure. Thus, all files on Agency support to the many Cuban
5
SECRET

SECRET
SUBJECT: The JFK Declassification Experience
exile groups and CIA involvement in Project MONGOOSE were
declared relevant. Hundreds of JMWAVE cables, Mexico City
Station documents, and Cuban names, and many with their
crypts, were released.
15. (U) Those records that the Board concluded
"truly had no apparent relevance to the assassination"
were designated "not believed relevant" (NBR). Cooperative
negotiation resulted in about 50,000 pages being declared
NBR.
INADVERTENT RELEASES/FOREIGN LIAISON CONCERNS
16. (AIUO) As noted above, inadvertent releases were
inevitable. The contributing factors included: guidelines
that changed almost continuously as negotiations with the
ARRB reduced the claims of current sensitivity; inaccurate
and incomplete records on the cover status of retirees; an
initial tendency, consistent with FOIA practices, to deny
crypts but to release true names- the crypt implying an
Agency relationship- if the text did not imply same. (Later:
duplicate copies plus mosaic pattern analysis made linkage of
some crypts and true name quite easy.); and a surge of
inexperienced reviewers loaned during the closing days to
meet the agreed NARA deadline for the remaining files.
17. (S) The inadvertent releases of former employees
names resulted in a few individual complaints but no known
foreign government or liaison service complaints. Four
foreign governments opposed release of their information.
when queried, but no inadvertent releases were involved.
(See Appendix C.) The worst slip appears to have been the
name of a former NOC, living abroad, who, upon being
informed, demanded and received compensation for the
violation of his confidential relationship with CIA and the
FBI. The other outraged former employee, also living abroad,
threatened to contact the President if it became known in his
adopted country that he had been CIA. His true name, on a
great many documents, is the only redaction; he was of
considerable interest to the Board as a key player in the
HSCA investigation because he was the Mexico Branch chief
and was initially appointed by the DDO to be the focal point
for JFK assassination information and briefings. The HSCA
allowed him to testify in alias, and the ARRB allowed the
substitution of his alias wherever his true name appeared;
however, the Board ruled that his true name should be
6

SECRET
SUBJECT: The JFK Declassification Experience
released in May 2001 or on his death if before that date.
Given the volume of the documents in which his name appeared,
there were inadvertent releases of his true name.
IMPACT OF THE JFK RELEASES ON FUTURE DECLASSIFICATION
PROGRAMS
18. (AIUO) Whether the JFK Act is, or should be
considered, precedent-establishing has been argued since
its passage. It addresses a unique, highly emotional event,
of obvious interest to the public; and it should serve as a
catalyst for future declassification policy discussion. But
it should not be considered to have set a legal precedent.
What should result is what the ARRB directed in the case
of exact duplicate documents: that they all be handled
consistently, with the same, or no, redactions. Other
documents concerning the same or a similar event, not exact
duplicates but relevant to the issue, and not subject to the
tight legal demands of the JFK legislation, could be reviewed
in accordance with the exemptions allowed under the FOIA or
the Executive Order. However, the basic factor in deciding
on release or denial should not be the avoidance of
embarrassment through inconsistent or inadvertent release.
It should be the current need for protection of sources and
methods.
19. (U) The JFK experience did demonstrate that a
traditional generic sources and methods denial is not always
necessary, defendable, or smart. Instead of being negatively
reactive, it may well be tactically smarter to be proactive
to better ensure protection of important secrets. More on.
that below.
20. (AIUO) LESSONS LEARNED:
Don't cut costs on indexing. Use experienced indexers.
Aim for indexing all materials before review and
processing begins. A key focus should be identification
of duplicate documents.
Use retirees with broad Agency experience under staff
supervision. Because the most common release problems
usually involve DO material, seriously consider an on
site-DO team.

SUBJECT: The JFK Declassification Experience
Develop and keep updating written guidelines, including
those for coordinating third-agency documents
Establish early what is already in the public domain.
Take a fresh look at the “official release" philosophy,
particularly as concerns former DCIs, Cabinet Officers,
Presidents, and Congressional investigations.
Develop better information on the cover status of retired
employees.
Avoid confrontation on marginal or non-relevant
information. Avoid stonewalling on relevant information.
Because the Information Review Officers are the key
implementers of information release policy, ensure that
the guidance given them by their Deputy Directors has
Agency corporate equity.
21. (AIUO) COMMENTS: Information Management,
Information Warfare, Information Handling, Information
Declassification: at least three of these terms have
elicited groans from senior Agency management and a
preference to have someone else, some staffer, deal with
the subject, keeping the boss out of trouble and minimally
informed. But inflexible insistence on continued
classification of dated information, particularly that
known to the public, ignorance of what has already been
declassified and released, and counterproductive stonewalling
these factors have caused trouble and will cause more
trouble as the “Information Age" matures.
22. (C) In 1976, then DDI Ed Proctor wrote to the DCI,
citing “the need to rationalize the classification process."
A 1977 memorandum for the Agency's Executive Committee by two
of the current HRG contract reviewers urged the development
of an O/DDCI level (the Executive Director position having
been abolished) policy review of flap potential in
information release and a computer-supported index to
released documents. At various times in the 1970s,
consideration was given to establishing a fifth Directorate
of Information Handling. After a good bit of internal
agonizing, DCI Gates in April 1992 signed off on HR 70-14
to make "significant historical information available without
