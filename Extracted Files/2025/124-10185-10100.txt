SYNOPSIS:
On 6/20/75, we were advised that CIA had in 1973
prepared a 693-page document citing instances wherein CIA
operations may have exceeded its mandate. This document, in
sanitized form, was reviewed by Intelligence Division personnel
and was found to contain many references to this Bureau, some
of which dealt with operations of an extremely sensitive
nature. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities
(SSC) has had access to this document. At the specific request
of this Bureau, CIA on 7/15/75 made available 190 pages of
the document believed to be of interest to this Bureau. These
pages are submitted as enclosures to this memorandum, which
highlights some of the contents thereof. Items so highlighted
include various technical support CIA has provided this
Bureau in the area of electronic coverage of embassies in the
United States, handling of Iron Curtain country defectors;
CIA notional and proprietary operations, some of which were
used to procure technical equipment for this Bureau CIA-FBI
cooperation in training matters relating to counter-espionage
responsibilities; interception of mail from behind the Iron
Curtain; CIA briefing and debriefing of FBI sources traveling
abroad and CIA involvement and interest in domestic dissident
groups. Mention is made in this document that while McCone
was CIA Director, conversations over his phone and in his
office were recorded. As SSC has had access to this document
attempts are being made to fully identify all references for
purpose of possible damage assessment to this Bureau. 5 1975
