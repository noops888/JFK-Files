MEMORANDUM FOR:
SUBJECT
Chief, Western Hemisphere Division
Termination of Project KDAFGHAN
1. Project KDAFGHAN, approved for FY 72 and FY 73 in the
amount of $11,950 each year, covered Mexico City Station's
observation post targetted against the Cuban Embassy and
consulate in Mexico. OP operators KDAFGHAN-1 and his depen-
dent mother KDAFGHAN-2, Cuban exiles resident in Mexico since
1960, were the only human assets in the project.
2. As a result of the JMYAK damage assessment and other
security considerations it was decided that the project should
be terminated and the agents resettled in another country.
DIRECTOR 285255 amended the project for FY 72 to a total of
$20,950 to provide for the termination and resettlement of the
agents. The agents were terminated in August 72 and are now
being resettled in Spain. DIRECTOR 300167 concurred in
terminating the project as of 31 August 72.
3. In view of the developments in paragraph 2, above,
WH/PI recommends approval of this termination request.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division
SUBJECT
: Project KDAFGHAN Termination
1. A request for termination action is contained in
paragraph four, herein.
2. Project KDAFGHAN is a support project which provides
the Mexico City Station with fixed photographic and physical
surveillance of the Cuban Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City.
The objectives of the project are to furnish photographic cov-
erage of the Cuban installation during daylight hours, to
assist the Station in compiling dossiers on officials of the
installation, and to fulfill various requirements in support
of other Station Cuban operations. The KDAFGHAN project en-
compasses two assets, KDAFGHAN-1 and KDAFGHAN-2, who have been
associated with the project since 1962.
3. While this project may be of some value to the FBI
(FBI compares KDAFGHAN photographs with the photographs of
known leaders of extremist groups in the U.S. as well as with
photographs of persons who are subjects of identification
orders prepared on badly wanted fugitives in the U.S.), it is
of little value, as presently constituted, to Mexico City
Station. There are other means of obtaining photographs of
PCS and TDY Cuban personnel.
4. In early 1972 the Station mounted a thorough CI review
of all Cuban operations in an attempt to improve their overall
security. Although KDAFGHAN-1 passed the SGSWIRL with no
apparent deception, his Cuban exile status, the long period
of time he has been operating his OP site in close proximity
to the Cuban Embassy, and the potential (perhaps immediate)
danger presented by his and KDAFGHAN-2's Cuban relatives made

it clear that the agents should be terminated. In view of the
aforementioned, as well as security considerations in the JMYAK
case, WH/1 requests approval to terminate this project effec-
tive 31 July 1972. In order to meet termination commitments
project KDAFGHAN was amended on 30 June 1972 by DIRECTOR 285255
in the amount of $9,000, increasing the project's authorization
from $11,950 to $20,950 for FY 1972. KDAFGHAN-1 and KDAFGHAN-2
were terminated on 1 August 1972. There were no security inci-
dents during the termination.

Purpose
KDAFGHAN is a support project which provides the Mexico
City Station with fixed photographic and physical surveillance
of the Cuban Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City. The
objectives of the project are to furnish photographic coverage
of the Cuban installation during daylight hours, to assist
the Station in compiling dossiers on officials of the
installation and to fulfill various requirements in support
of other Station Cuban operations.
Description
The KDAFGHAN Project continues to encompass two assets,
KDAFGHAN-1 and KDAFGHAN-2, who have been associated with the
project since 1962. Both agents continue to furnish information
on a timely basis on the personalities and activities of the
Cuban target. A description of the individual assets is set
forth below:
a. KDAFGHAN-1 (201-288248): A Cuban lawyer in exile in
Mexico who left Cuba in 1960. He has been the principal
agent of the KDAFGHAN Project since 1962. KDAFGHAN-1's
cover is that of a translator and would-be writer. Family
holdings from his deceased father also provide financial
backstopping. All photographic coverage of the main Embassy
gate through final printing and mounting is processed by
KDAFGHAN-1.
b. KDAFGHAN-2 (201-305604): KDAFGHAN-2 is the mother of
KDAFGHAN-1. Her cover is that of a dependent mother. KDAFGHAN-2
acts as KDAFGHAN-1's assistant and fill-in whenever he is away
from the basehouse.

Changes
The only major change during the project year was the
installation of a TV monitor/robot camera combination during
October 1970, the month designated as "Cuban month." This
added coverage contributed to the compilation of target
studies on several Cuban officials, These studies will be
used as a starting point for future operations, namely the
recruitment/defection of these officials.
Accomplishments
1. The main value of the production of the KDAFGHAN
Project has been in establishing the pattern of various Cuban
Embassy employees. The monitoring has also revealed which
automobiles the various employees usually drive. Photographic
coverage of the visitors to the main gate of the Cuban Embassy
and logs of the movement of Cuban Embassy personnel have proved
very useful in identifying new Cuban PCS employees in Mexico,
Normally the Station has been able to match movements of new
and old employees during the initial period when duties and
contacts were being turned over to the new employees and so
identify their duties. KDAFGHAN has provided current photographs
of TDY and transiting Cuban officials and Headquarters has
often provided positive identifications of these persons.
Norberto Hernandez, a DGI headquarters officer
visiting Mexico, was identified in this way.
2. The Station utilizes KDAFGHAN photographic coverage
and logs to verify the visits of Station assets to the Cuban
Embassy.
3. KAFGHAN also provides coverage of what appears to
be American visitors to the Cuban Embassy main gate.
case of Americans who arrive in automobiles bearing U.S.
In the
license plates, the license plate number, car description,
and sterile copies of photographs are given to the FBI for
identification. A significant result of the KDAFGHAN operation
included a photographic of a specific individual an old FBI
target who had been seen visiting the Cuban installation.
4. KDAFGHAN also provided useful coverage for the
KDACOUSTIC-3 operation, an operation aimed at the recruitment
or defection of a DGI officer. This coverage enabled the
Station to determine KDACOUSTIC-3's movements, an important
factor in timing the calls and visits of our access agents.
This use of the operation should prove extremely valuable during
the coming year since a more aggressive recruitment program
against the Cuban target is planned.

Problems and Security
No agent control or operational problems have been
reported. Neither were there any security problems encountered
during the period. Gerald D. FAHLANGER continues to be the
Case Officer and handler of KDAFGHAN-1. FAHLANGER has met
and could continue to meet KDAFGHAN-2 in an emergency.
The
alternate Case Officer is Terence D. SISTONE who meets
KDAFGHAN-1 when FAHLANGER is not available. Both Case Officers
are known to the assets in alias, and both meet KDAFGHAN-1
in a safehouse. During February 1971 the safehouse was
changed in compliance with normal operational security.
Meetings are generally held once a week. More frequent
contact can be made by telephone. In an emergency, anyone
can call KDAFGHAN-1 at his home and say they are a friend
of "Pepe Simon." KDAFGHAN-1 will reply "I haven't seen him
since last Christmas." KDAFGHAN-1 speaks English.
Coordination:
The Ambassador is aware of our efforts against the
Cuban target in general. He has not been specifically briefed
on this operation.
Future Plans:
The Station is constantly examining the possibility of
an audio installation at the main gate of the Cuban Embassy.
A successful audio device would serve, in most cases, to
identify the individuals who are photographed by KDAFGHAN-1
since they normally identify themselves to the gate house
attendant. There are a few Station assets who have occasional
access to the gate house, and it is conceivable that one of
them could place a quick plant device, provided security
conditions are favorable. The Station currently has under
consideration a recruitment effort against a lower level
employee of the Cuban Embassy who would be of tremendous
help in such an operation.
Costs:
1. General: This renewal request is for FY 1972 in
the amount of $11,950 and FY 1973 in the amount of $11,950.
2. Source of Funds: Project KDAFGHAN is included in
the Western Hemisphere Division's Operating Program in the
amount of $10,844 for FY 1972 and $10,844 for FY 1973.
The additional Funds required are to be absorbed from within
the WH Division allocation.

Purpose:
The LIONION Project provides the Mexico City Station
with fixed, selective photographic and physical surveillance
of the Cuban Embassy and Cuban Consulate in Mexico City.
It
is designed to provide information in support of Priority A,
paragraphs 2 and 4 of the current Operating Directive, that
is, the Cuban target present in Mexico and the support
rendered by Cubans in Mexico to exile and other leftist
groups in Mexico.
Description:
1. The LIONION Project currently encompasses two agents,
LIONION/1 and LIONION/2, a basehouse directly across from the
Cuban compound, and a safehouse for meetings with Station Case
Officers. The two agents furnish photographic coverage during
daylight hours of the main entrance to the Cuban Embassy.
In
addition, on a spot basis, photographic coverage and visual
surveillance of the Cuban Consulate entrance is possible.
agents also act as dispatchers for the unilateral LIEMBRACE
surveillance team when the LIEMBRACE team is being used
against Cuban target individuals. A description of the
individual assets is set forth below.
The
2. LIONION/1 (201-288248): A Cuban lawyer in exile in
Mexico who left Cuba in 1960. He has been the principal agent
of the LIONION Project since 1962. LIONION/l's cover is that

provide financial backstopping. LIONION/1 received. his
"immigrado" (permanent immigrant) status in 1965 and now
has a good deal of immunity from harassment from Mexican
immigration authorities. All photographic coverage of the
main Embassy gate through final printing, cropping, and
mounting is processed by LIONION/1. LIONION/1 and LIONION/2
