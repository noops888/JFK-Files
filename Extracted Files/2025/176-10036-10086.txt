THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION. SOURCE GRADINGSAREDEFINITIVE. APPRAISAL OF CONTENT IS TENTATIVE.
SOURCE AN AMERICAN OBSERVER (B); FROM COLONEL TON THAT XUNG.
APPR. IT IS PROBABLY TRUE THAT XUNG HOLDS THE VIEWS STATED; HOWEVER, THE CONTENTS OF.
THE STATEMENTS ARE CONSIDERED POSSIBLY TRUE.
1. COLONEL ΤΟΝ THAT XUNG, COMMANDER OF THE RANGER COMMAND, DURING A
3 JUNE 1962 LUNCHEON MEETING WITH TON THAT CHU, CHIEF OF PLEIKU PROVINCE, SAID
THAT THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH VIETNAM WERE GETTING TIRED OF THE PRESENT SITUATION AND
THAT SOME ACTION WAS GOING TO BE TAKEN TO CHANGE IT. THIS TIME, HOWEVER, THE
PLANS WERE NOT GOING TO BE COMMUNICATED TO THE AMERICANS BECAUSE THE UNITED
STATES, A BASICALLY LAW-ABIDING NATION, IS OPPOSED TO UNLAWFUL ACTS. SINCE A
COUP D'ETAT IS CONSIDERED BY AMERICAN OFFICIALS TO BE AN UNLAWFUL PROCESS, THE
US IS FORCED TO DISCOURAGE SUCH ACTIONS, AND THEREFORE, THE AMERICANS WILL NOT
HE NOTIFIED OF ANY FUTURE ACTIVITY ON THE PART OF THE VIETNAMESE TO UPSET THE
CURRENT REGIME UNTIL THE ACTION IS ACCOMPLISHED.
