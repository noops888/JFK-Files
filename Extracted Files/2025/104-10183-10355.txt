report from Hensry 8. PACHANKIS concerning AMMUG-1.
2. As indicated, PACHANKIS broke the bad news
contained in Reference B on AMMUG-1's citizenship.
AMMUG-1 apparently took the news as well as could
be expected. Nevertheless, the Station would appreciate
periodic notice on the status of AMMUG-1's case so
we may keep him informed on any progress.
3. In regard to Reference C, PACHANKIS probed in
the area of wife problems and never really resolved
the situation. PACHANKIS seemed to think, however,
that the wife is still living with AMMUG-1.

1. On 26 February when Henry S. PACHANKIS met with
AMMUG-1 (201-749651) on his citizenship problem, information
on the following two brothers vas obtained:
Hector RODRIGUEZ Llompart
(201-276598)
Cuban Ambassador to East Germany
Roberto RODRIGUEZ Llompart
CIT:
Cuba
DOB: 22 October 1932
POB: Regla, Havana, Cuba
OCC: Governmont
2. This information was as follows:
3. AMMUG-1 was asked if he had anything new to
report, He brought up a most interesting case, one
which could prove to be a valuable lead.
b. AMMUG-1 has known the RODRIGUEZ family since
his childhood in Regla (a small town across the bay
from Havana). The father had been a bolita banker
during the Batista era.
c. AMMUG-1 was very friendly with RODRIGUEZ' two
sons:

d. During the middle and late 1950s, Roberto
had been a salesman for the Burroughs flour company
and had stayed clear of the political picture in Cuba.
e. During the same period, Hector had been a
student in the University of Havana, under Raul ROA,
and had taken part in some revolutionary activities.
He had been arrested and beaten by the Batista police
for his anti-government actions and his father had
sent him into exile in the US.
f. When Castro came into power, the father was
a potential "var criminal" for his illicit dealings.
AMMUG-1, who was in the police force in the initial
stages of the revolution, states that he deleted an
incriminating page from the father's dossier (showing
he paid off the police to run his bolita operation)
and thus saved him from prosecution.
g. AMMUG-1 continued to be close to the family,
especially with Roberto, "whom I sav every day and
ran around with." Roberto never entertained the
revolution. As late as 1962-63, "We used to talk
quite openly and frankly. He was always against the
revolution and the communists. Ile worked in the
Ministry of Industry because his brother got him the
job, but he had only one idea in his head: to get out
of Cuba and come to the US. He was even plotting to
get out by boat. He had a US visa for many years and
had visited here many times."
h. When AMUG-1 defected, he lost contact with
Roberto. But, about two weeks ago a neighbor from
Regla came to Miami on the Freedom Flights. (COMMENT:
This undoubtedly refers to Cuban refugee Segundo
CASCUDO Gonzalez. Reference forwarded the AMOT
debriefing of CASCUDO on Roberto.) When AMMUG-1
asked about Roberto, the neighbor said that he under-
stood that Roberto, "was assigned in a foreign
Dabassy." The refugee could not say what country
Roberto was in.
"This

don't think that he has changed his original way of
thinking. I believe he took the job to get out of
Cuba, and because of the influence of his brother
Hector. I know he will talk to me and there is no
telling what this man is capable of doing if someone
approached him."
j.
Roberto is (or was) married to:
Zulema (Inu)
DPOB: c. 1934 in Cuba
They had two children and the wife was even
more anti-Castro than Roberto.
k.
Hector, the other brother, was a rabid revolutionary
when AMMUG-1 last saw him in c. 63-64. He had joined
the Castro bandwagon at the outset due to his revolutionary
activities during the Batista era and his closeness to
Raul ROA. In c. 1960-61-62, Hector was closely aligned

be used to bring me gifts when he returned from trips
but you couldn't even insinuate any opposition to the
revolution, ho was so fierce for it. I hear that ho
is the Ambassador to Germany; I guess through his
friendship with Raul ROA. I doubt if he has changed,
but I can talk to him in complete confidence-perhaps
not like I could Roberto--but I could know how he
thinks".
3. Since Roberto appears to be an excellent recruit-
ment target, we will have him watchlisted with a view
toward having AMMUG-1 make an approach to him at the
first opportunity. Although Hector appears far less
vulnerable, ve vill consider an approach to him should
he be transferred to a Free World country.

CROSS REFERENCE TO
On 30 December 1969, AMNIP-1 reported that AMMUG-1's
wife called him on the day before Christmas and informed him
that her father had been hospitalized with a heart attack
and that AMMUG-1 had left her. AMNIP-1 called AMMUG-1's
place of employment in Miami on the day after Christmas and
was informed AMMUG-1 was not working that day. AMNIP-1 left
a message for AMMUG-1 to call him but as of 30 December had
not heard from AMMUG-1. AMNIP-1 commented that he thought
AMMUG-l's wife was a little unbalanced mentally and although
her parents are now in the United States and she has no real
ties left in Cuba, that she is interested in returning to
Cuba.
