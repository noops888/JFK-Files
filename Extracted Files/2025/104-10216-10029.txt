An official Canadian service from officials in Havana.
1. In late April 1968 there was a successful prison
break at the El Principe Prison in Havana. A group of
prisoners escaped by digging a tunnel to the courtyard of
a neighboring hospital. After the escape, ex-Major
Rolando Cubela Secades, who was convicted in March 1966
for plotting to assassinate Fidel Castro, was transferred
from El Principe to a prison in Oriente Province.

2. It was rumored that Huber Matos, imprisoned since
October 1959, was one of the escapees. However, according
to the wife of a prisoner in La Cabana Prison in Havana,
Matos and 20 other political prisoners were still in Gal-
lery 23 of that prison. Although none of them wore prison
uniforms, it is said that the authorities stopped being
severe with them on this count.
3. Field Dissem: None.
