Subject: DS&T and DO Briefing Questions
COMMENTS:
Bany,
Attached are the final versions of the DS&T and DO briefing questions. There are no changes in
the DS&T questions. Questions have been added to the DO list to reflect our conversation
March 19 and 20. You, of course, already have our detailed explanations for the earlier DO
questions. If you have any questions or if there are any problems, please give me a call. I should
be in all day. See you tomorrow.

Questions for Follow-up DO Records Briefing
April 1, 1997
P.4
1. At what point did the DDP begin to keep records of destroyed records? For
example, in a Cold Warrior footnote, Tom Mangold reports that as any of Angleton's
files were destroyed, "a complete record was carefully maintained about what had been
done. (George) Kalaris signed off on every file and the DCI's office was notified."
(p. 143) Where are these records?
2. Could an archival search be run on specific topics for retired records at the CIA's
Record's Center? Perhaps an ARRB staffer could be present during the search to review
the abstracts and to suggest other fields or topics to be searched?
3. Could a crypt search for records containing relevant crypts be run through
cryptographic reference? How would queries need to be framed and stated?
4. Why is it so difficult to develop a list for all personnel (official, contract,
administrative, or TDY) assigned to the post referenced in RIF 104-10065-10199 from
1959-1964?
5. We have been working to identify all technical and surveillance operations in and on
the Cuban and Soviet consulates and embassies in Mexico City between September 1
and December 1, 1963. How can we frame a search query to determine if we have a
comprehensive and complete list of all operations at that time?
6. How can a search query be framed to document all electronic take produced by the
Mexico City Station in the immediate wake of the assassination (the first month) and
during the period of Oswald's visit? How can we verify that what exists in the
Sequestered Collection represents all records of the technical production that was
available at the time of the assassination? If additional records or original production
still exists, where would it be stored or filed? What searches could be conducted to
retrieve any additional records? If such electronic take has been destroyed, do records
exist of the destruction?
7. Could you describe the process by which operational funds are proposed, approved,
received, and distributed (circa 1963). What funding and disbursement records exist?
How are they organized? How should a request be formulated to institute a reasonable
search of these records?

MAR 31 '97 12:05PM
P.5
8. We have seen DDP monthly operational reports which contain information on the
allocation/distribution of operational funds. Are there other DDP records which would
reflect how certain projects utilized their funding? How are these records organized?
How should a search query be framed?
9. Various open sources have linked the CIA to various journalists and publishing
companies during the 1960's. How should a query be framed to search for connections
between the Agency and journalists or publishing companies?
10. Did the Agency have any relationship, projects, or contacts with publishing houses
during the time of the assassination and in the aftermath of the Warren Commission?
How would a search be formulated to determine whether or not the Agency had a
relationship with any of the same publishing houses that were also publishing books
about the assassination?
11. How would a query be framed to search for files on any office or person dealing
with organized crime and Cuba? How should a request be formulated to institute a
reasonable search on this topic?
12. Is there a comprehensive record or list detailing the identities of individuals on the
Interagency Source Register? How are these records organized? How can a search
query be framed to ascertain whether or not a particular individual appears in the
Register,
13. How could a search query be framed to ascertain whether or not a particular
individual was given access to classified information by DCD (then OO)? What kind of
files are assembled in the process of clearing non-Agency contacts/sources for access to
classified information?
14. ARRB's Request for Additional Information and Record No. CIA-13, dated
November 1, 1996, contained the following questions:
A.
What forms of backchannel communications were there between the
Mexico City Station (including the COS), JMWAVE, or Headquarters
during 1963? By "backchannel" we mean, inter alia, any administrative,
senior staff, or restricted access communications, or any written or
electronic communications other than regular cables or dispatches (of the
type included in the JFK Collection).
B.
Were there, in fact, any backchannel communications between the Mexico
City Station (including the COS), JMWAVE, or Headquarters during the
time periods 27 Sept - 16 Oct 1963 and 22 Nov - 30 Nov 1963?

C.
To the extent that there were any backchannel communications for the
time periods 27 Sept - 16 Oct 1963 and 22 Nov - 30 Nov 1963 (other than
those currently contained in the JFK Collection), please make such records
available for review.
Why has it been so difficult to answer these questions?
15. ARRB's Request for Additional Information and Record No. CIA-14, dated
December 23, 1996, documented our request for the annual or biannual Station reports
for Mexico City Station for 1963 and 1964. Why has it been so difficult to provide these
reports?
16. The attached Agency document released in 1996 contains the paragraph:
11. A memorandum marked only for file, 16 March 1967, signed M.D.
Stevens, says that J. Monroe SULLIVAN, #280207, was granted a covert
security approval on 10 December 1962 so that he could be used in Project
QKENCHANT. (Clay) Shaw has # 402897-A.
What do these numbers mean? What does the "A" at the ends of Shaw's number
signify? Do the files identified by these numbers still exist? Why was Sullivan granted
a covert security approval?
17. During the period 1959-1963, what was the purpose or goal of QKENCHANT?
18. Under what circumstances were non-agency employees given covert security
clearances for the QKENCHANT project?
19. Did Clay Shaw receive a covert security approval for the QKENCHANT project?
Why was one needed? Did Clay Shaw receive covert security clearances for any
project other than QKENCHANT
20. What did Clay Shaw do within the QKENCHANT project?
21. Do records exist to account for the disposition of all files on Clay Shaw?
22. Did Howard Hunt have any involvement with the QKENCHANT project prior to
1964?
23. Did J. Monroe Sullivan have any involvement with the QKENCHANT project prior
to 1964?

SHAW to him. J.. Monroe SULLIVAN, executive director of
the San Francisco World Trade Center, told the Associated
Press that SHAW was in San Francisco and touring the
Canter with him on the day of the assassination. SHAW,
now retired, was formerly the managing director of the
Intemational Trade Mart in New Orleans. He is 54 years
old. Ramsey Clark, U.8. Attorney General, said that the
FBI had investigated SHAW late in 1963. "On the evidence
that the FBI has, there was no connection found" with the
assassination.
7. Memorandum No. 84-67, 3 March 1967, from Chief,
Now Orleans Office, to Director, Domestic Contact Service,
re SKAW.
a.
The first contact of the New Orleans office
of the DCS with Clay SHAW occurred in
December 1948. A nama check request was
raturned "no info" on 23 March 1949. SHAW
was contacted by Mr. Hunter Leake of the
New Orleans office seven times in 1949,
twice in 1950, five times in 1951, nine
times in 1952, once in 1953, twice in 1954,
twice in 1955, and twice in 1956. SHAW
is the source of eight 00-B reports sub-
mitted by the New Orleans office. At one
tima ho had the "Y" number 145.1. The
last contact took place on 25 May 1956.
On 23 January 1967 Jack S. MARTIN phoned
the New Orleans office, said that he was
working on an important undercover deal
for. Garrison and Detectiva Louis IVON,
and was calling at IVON's request. He was
culling to ask the head of the CIA office
to telephone IVON on his unlisted number.
No such call was made. The writer, Lloyd
A. Ray, asks that the General Counsel be
informed and that he provide advice.

produced by CI/R & A). The following additional infor-
mation was provided by the New Orleans office of DCS.

Since 25 May 1956 Mr. Hunter Leake had seen SHAW casually,
by chance, in various downtown New Orleans restaurants,
and greetings were exchanged. The last such casual
encounter was just before SHAW's retirement in 1965.
9. On 7 March 1967 Pravda published an article
called "Clay Shaw of the CIX datalined Rome, 6 Harch
1967, written by V. YERMAKOV. The article charged that.
CIA made use of the services of Clay SHAW for CIA'S OWL
interests in Italy. The Pravda piece notes that the DA
in New Orleans is accusing SHAW. of participation in the
assassination conspiracy. It says SHAW spent "some years"
in Rome as a World Trade Canter leader. It claims that
the Center was a cover for financing anti-Communist activity.
CIA gave directives to SHAW. The World Trade Canter was
a branch of "Permidax" (sic), "which the newspapers in
Switserland openly accused of 'criminal operations'...."
(Comments It appears that all of the Pravda charges ara
untrue, except that there was a CIA-SHAW relationship. So
far as is known, SHAW was naver asked to use his relation-
ship with the World Trade Center for clandestine purpoвов
and, in fact, he has not been in Italy.)

Testimony of Hbram
Legal Advisor, Dept. of State
1342-343
Warren Commission, Vol.5 pp
Mr. OHAYES. NO; I think in each case it will depend so much on the altuation
with the particular person. If a person comes in and he is very agitated or
something of that kind, it might dictate a totally different approach than a differ
ent kind of thing.
Mr. DULLES. Wouldn't it be useful though to give-I don't want to suggest
what the Secretary of State should do in this, but in the light of this experi-
ence, would there not be some benefit possibly in giving people in the field the
result of the experience gained in this particular case?
Mr. CHAYES. Well, the general approach, and other matters related to it,
are touched on in orientation courses for consular officers and so on. I think
as I look on Consul Snyder's actions, that he behaved very much like a respon-
sible Foreign Service officer.
That happened long before I was in the Department, so I can say that
without any involvement.. But it seemed to me that he did just what be
should have done, despite the unfortunate aftermath. And it shows to me, at
least, that the training and orientation that these people are getting is right, is
serviceable, and they are able to handle these situations as they come in..
Mr, Duruza. I realize that you ought not to prescribe hard and fast rules,
that there is a broad range of discretion that should be exercised here. But I
just raise the question as to whether a good deal of experience hasn't been gained
in this case in that very field.
Mr. CHAYER. Well, it may very well be that more attention to that particular
aspect should be given in the orientation courses and so on. Those things
tend to reflect what is hot at the moment you know, and if you haven't had
trouble with something for a pretty long time, it tenda maybe not to get
mentioned.
Representative Forn. If Oswald had persisted that day, October 81, in de
manding the form that is a prerequisite under your definition for renunciation,
would Snyder have been required to give it to him and permit him to sign it?
Mr. CHAYES.. I think if it had been in ordinary office hours when the con-
silate was open for business, and if Snyder was satisfied that he was competent,
that Oswald was competent, he would have to give him the form, yes, sår.
Representative Foro. Does Snyder. have the authority to make a determina-
tion of competency?
Mr. CHAYES. No; he doesn't have the authority to make a determination of
competence, and I suppose it is possible at some point to get the issue tried in
court. But I think a consular officer would probably be acting within his
discretion if he saw sombody who was drunk or raving or something and just
said, "Well, I am not going to give you this until I am sure that your action is
your act." After all; when the consul accepts the cath, he is certifying that it
is the act of the person in a meaningful sense, and so if he thought that the
person was incompetent, I think be would have discretion pot to give the oath.
But I put that far aside becatise in the particular case bere, Mr. Snyder made it
perfectly clear that he bad no reason to doubt that Oswald was fully competent.
And so if Oswald had been there at a time when the office was open, or had
returned at a time when the office was open, and bad persisted in his demand,
I think Snyder would have been under an obligation to give him the form.
Representative Foun. The only technical reason or basis upon which Snyder
could have denied Oswald the right that day was the fact that it was on a
Saturday, a non-working-hour period of the Embassy.
Mr. CHAYES. Yes; I think he had every right to try to dissuade him, or per-
suade him not to act or persuade him to think it over and come back the next
day. But if after all of that Oswald still had said "But I want to do it now"
and if the office was open for business, then I think he would have bad to do it.
Mr. DULIES. I think it might be useful if it has not beeri done to introduce
at this point as an exhibit the form of oath of renunciation.. Here is the for
malized oath and I think it would be well to have this in our records unless
it is already in our records.
Representative Forn. I agree.
Mr. COLEMAN. No; it isn't. Could we say it will be marked as Commission
Exhibit No. 955 and place this sticker on that page, photostat it and then just
sand it her
(Commission Exhibit No. 965 was marked for identification and received in
evidenca)
Representative FUED. When Oswald came back on November 8, I believe, which
was a regular working day.

Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. Commisioner, he did not come back on November & Ho
merely wrote a letter.
Mr. CHAYES. Wrote a letter. He never came back..
MeVlekar,
Representative FORD. Are all of the employees, Mr. Snyder, Mr. Mcv
and the others who had any firsthand contact with the Oswald case in this
Area, were they State Department employees?...
Mr. OHAYES. Yes, sir; these two men, who, were the only ones who did see
him directly, I I think the secretary, their secretary also saw him, but had
aw him, but had nothing
to do with him except as a receptionist. These two men were Foreign Serv-
Ice officers and are now Foreign Berylce officers.
Representative Foam. In the strictest term
Mr. CHATKE. Yes, sir; members of the Foreign Service, appointed by the
President with the advice and consent of the Senate.
Representative Forn, Could you tell us in a bit more detall the process that
you followed or the procedure that you carried out when you first got into the
Oswald care.
You mentioned yesterday you got a call or or you were directed by I believe
the Secretary of State or by somebody in higher authority to take certain steps.
Will you tell us who called you, what you did in the first 8 or 4 days?
Mr. OHAYrs. It was the evening of the day, perhaps about 5 o'clock on the
day of the assassination. It may have been somewhat earller, becaise I think
I remember I went home for an hour and then came back to carry out this
Assignment. Mr. Ball, once it became known that Oswald had some history as
a defector GEORGE WY Ball
D.C
Mr. Durtas. Ball is the Under Secretary of Statem
Mr. CHAYES. He was then the Acting Secretary, because the Secretary of State
as you recall was on a plane over the Pacific. So be was the Acting Secretary.
But even if he had been the Under Becretary he is my client.
Representative FORD. He still had some authority.
Mr. CHATES. Yes; he directed me to gather together the files in the Department
on Oswald, and to prepare a report to be available for him the first thing in the
morning covering as best we could within that time span the contacts that
Oswald had with the Department.
We got the passport file. We got the security office file. We got the special
consular services file which covered Mrs. Oswald's visa and the repatriation
loan: I think those three files were the ones that we had. It may have been
there was a smaller fourth file, but I think those three were the ones.
Representative Fown. What would that smaller fourth file be?
Mr. CHAYES, I can't remember. It was duplicates if it was anything. Oh, that
is right, we had a visa file and an 808 file so those were the four. The 80B
file, that is Special Consular Services, in the office, in the Bureau of Security
and Consular Affairs.
Representative Foen. You got this order on or about 5 o'clock the 22d of
November?.
Mr. OHAYES, The 22d; yea, str.
Bepresentative Ford. And you issued orders to have these files brought in,
or did you go and get them yourself?
Mr. CHATEB. No.

Mr. CHAYES. I issued orders to have them brought in. I called I am trying
to think how we got them. [Turning to Mr. Ehrlich.) Did you go down and
get them? Mr. Ehrlich and Mr. Lowenfeld, another of my people, we worked
through the night on this, the three of us all together and it may be that the
two of them went down to get them. I don't think we just called over the tele-
phone and asked them to be brought up...

Types of Questions for Follow-up DO Records Briefing
March 17, 1997
1. At what point did the DDP begin to keep records of destroyed records? For
example, in a Cold Warrior footnote, Tom Mangold reports that as any of Angleton's
files were destroyed, "a complete record was carefully maintained about what had been
done. (George) Kalaris signed off on every file and the DCI's office was notified."
(p. 143) Where are these records?
2. Could an archival search be run on specific topics for retired records at the CIA's
Record's Center? Perhaps an ARRB staffer could be present during the search to review
the abstracts and to suggest est other fields or topics to b to be searched?
3. Could a crypt search for records containing relevant crypts be run through
cryptographic reference? How would queries need to be framed and stated?*
4. Why is it so difficult to develop a list for all personnel (official, contract,
administrative, or TDY) assigned to the post referenced in RIF 104-10065-10199?

5. We have been working to identify all technical and surveillance operations in and on
the Cuban and Soviet consulates and embassies in Mexico City between September 1
and December 1, 1963. How can we frame a search query to determine if we have a
comprehensive and complete list of all operations at that time?
6. How can a search query be framed to document all electronic take produced by the
Mexico City Station in the immediate wake of the assassination (the fist month) and
during the period of Oswald's visit? How can we verify that what exists in the
Sequestered Collection represents all records of the technical production that was
available at the time of the assassination? If additional records or original production
still exists, where would it be stored or filed? What searches could be conducted to
retrieve any additional records? If such electronic take has been destroyed, do records
exist of the destruction?
7. Could you describe the process by which operational funds are proposed, approved,
received, and distributed (circa 1963). What funding and disbursement records exist?
How are they organized? How should a request be formulated to institute a reasonable
search of these records?
