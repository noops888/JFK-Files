EVENTS LEADING TO RECRUITMENT
Charles W. Wiley first came to the official atten-
tion of the Office of Security (OS) on 9 September 1955,
when Carl F. Heney (Executive Officer, OS) forwarded a
letter written by Wiley to Ermal Geiss (Chief, Personnel
Security Division, OS), who in turn directed the letter
to James W. McCord [Security Research Staff of the Office
of Security (SRS)]. How Heney obtained the Wiley letter
is unknown, inasmuch as the name of the addressee was
deleted in the letter. However, the letter was recorded
in the Executive Registry under number 6-9881. The Wiley
letter is dated 27 April 1955, gives Wiley's address and
telephone number, and Wiley advised that he was working
on an index of the Daily Worker for the years 1933-1945
"and thought that perhaps you might be interested in
specific information that I am likely to find."
On 10 September 1955, James W. McCord contacted Wiley
in Flushing, New York. At that time, Wiley explained the
nature of the index of the Daily Worker for the year
1034-
1945, by stating that he was preparing the index under a
grant from the American Legion Americanism Committee,
headed Lee Pennington (a former employee of the FBI).
Wiley started the index in November 1954. Wiley stated
The contacted the major government agencies in Washington
to ascertain what information in the Daily Worker would
be of most interest to them, and in addition, contacted
a couple of Congressional Committees which McCord surmised
were the House Committee on Un-American Activities and the
Senate Internal Security Committee. Wiley estimated it
would take two and a half years to complete the index.
that time, Wiley was receiving part-time clerical assis-
tance from the Women's Auxiliary of the American Legion
Post in Flushing, New York. Wiley also indicated an in-
terest in Agency employment after finishing the index.
At
The results of McCord's interview with Wiley were
brought to the attention of Robert Bannerman, Deputy Direc-
tor of Security, by 21 November 1955, when Bannerman opined
that "this may be valuable."

had indexed 150,000 names of the Daily Worker covering
January 1934 through June 1936. Wiley stated that the
FBI in New York City and the American Legion were already
making "extensive use" of the index cards. Wiley stated
that one of his purposes being in Washington was to secure
financing for the index continuation.
He stated that his
$5000 a year grant from the American Legion Americanism
Committee would expire at the end of December 1955, and
if negotiations with that body were unsuccessful, he would
attempt to secure financing from the Senate and House Inves-
tigating Committees. Wiley stated that the FBI has indi-
cated the strongest desire that he continue the indexing
but that in his discussion with Mr. DeLoach (Cartha DeLoach,
an FBI senior official), no indication of forthcoming finan-
cial support from the Bureau for this work was indicated.

In recording this contact with Wiley, McCord opined:
"I think it is obvious that the index
which Wiley is working on would be of con-
siderable value to the Security Ottice and
to CIA, particularly since the Communist
Party membership and activities during the
1934-40 period were for the most part very
open and extensively advertised in the Daily
Worker. An example of how open their activi-
ties were is indicated in the fact that
Elizabeth Bentley's name was mentioned in
a 1935 issue of the Daily Worker at a time
prior to her going underground and acquiring
a RIS (Russian Intelligence Service) mission.
If the Daily Worker thus bears a record of
(Communist) Party activities of an indi-
vidual such as Bentley, who later became
so prominent in RIS activities in the
United States, then the possibility always
exists that the names of persons later con-
nected with OSS (Office of Strategic Services)
and other governmental activity may also be
mentioned in the 1934-40 Daily Worker issues,
which have heretofcre never been indexed by
any government agency.

"Because of the obvious value of
having access to such an index, the writer
(McCord) recommends that we encourage the
continuation of Wiley's index project in
any way in which we are able to further
such work."
(There is no objective evidence in the file other than
the above to support Wiley's contention that he was given
encouragement by Mr. DeLoach of the FBI to continue the pro-
ject.)
The above was brought to the attention of Harlan
Westrell (Chief, Counterintelligence Branch, SRS), who
in turn brought the matter to the attention of Colonel
Sheffield Edwards, Director of Security, circa early
December 1955.
Via a memorandum dated 19 December 1955, McCord
informed Westrell of the receipt of additional correspon-
dence from Wiley, and McCord included a rehash of the
metter including statements:
"I hope the Office of Security
can encourage the continuation of the
project, at least until the index is
completed up through 1940, which would
take about another year of work by Wiley.
The index has considerable potential CE
(counter espionage) value to this Office,
for one thing, by virtue of the fact that
there will be numerous heretofore unidenti-
fied Communists' names turn up in the
index, some of whom went underground
during the World War II years. The
index may give us the one clue neces-
sary to detect any such penetration

in protecting the Agency thereby is of
course inestimable. The continuation
of the project would have other merits,
which we have discussed previously."
McCord also recommended that, should the project fail,
the Agency consider employing Wiley.

McCord recommended that Wiley had a personal acquain-
tance with a number of the well-known ex-Communist Party
key functionaries, such as Louis Budenz, as well as a
personal acquaintance with the heads and research people
in all of the Federal Congressional Committees, and State
Investigating Committees in New York State.
McCord was next in contact with Wiley on 27 December
1955, receiving an account of pertinent points retrieved
by Wiley from the indexing project. In addition, Wiley
stated he had discussed the indexing project with Herbert
Philbrick (an ex-FBI penetration of the CPUSA), who had a
continuing interest in the project and had indicated he
would be willing to help Wiley get a job in the newspaper
field should the project be terminated. Wiley also com-
mented that he had had lengthy political discussions with
Karl Wittfogel (one-time Communist) in recent years, and
was in contact with Wittfogel a few weeks before.
Speculation on identity of Private Individual
When McCord's 27 December contact with Wiley was
brought to the attention of Bannerman, he directed Westrell
to "Explore with Jim Angleton (CI Staff) the possibility of
getting about two months' expenses for subject (Wiley) and
in the meantime we can complete our clearance of him and
try to make out a project. We should also make a survey
of his work to be certain a project is justified."
in turn, directed McCord to talk to Birch O'Neal (CI Staff)
about the matter.

On a grant from the American Legion, 1608 K. Street, N.W.,
Washington, D. C., under the supervision of Lee Pennington.
As a result, McCord scheduled National Agency Checks in
the name of Wiley on 9 January 1956.
On 17 January 1956, McCord informed Westrell, receiving
his OK, that Wiley intended to place an article in the
monthly newsletter, "Political Research" published by an
organization affiliated with the NTS (anti-Soviet Russian
emigree organization). The article was to announce Wiley's
indexing project and solicit funds.
On 27 January 1956, McCord informed Westrell, Paul F.
Gaynor (Chief, SRS), Bannerman and Colonel Edwards of the
results of a meeting he had that day discussing Wiley's
indexing project with Birch O'Neal and Herman Horton (CI
Staff). In essence, it was agreed that some Agency funding
of the project should be forthcoming, and Horton evidenced
interest in Wiley for CI Staff employment after completion
of the project. Both Bannerman and Colonel Edwards evi-
denced interest in Agency funding of the project, the latter
asking for figures as to cost.
McCord was next in direct contact with Wiley in Flushing,
New York, on 29 January 1956, obtaining highlights of security
interest developed from the indexing.
By 6 February 1956, figures were produced showing that
$13,500 would cover one year continuation of the indexing,
$7,000 for Wiley, $3,000 for a clerk typist; and $3,000 for
part-time help and supplies. On this date, Gaynor noted he
"would like to see this project completed if at all possible."
By the first week of March 1956, "front office" verbal
approval had been given for OS funding of the project, labeled
Operation Recall, concurrent with a meeting between McCord
and Wiley and arrangements were made for transporting the
completed portion of the index to Washington, D. C.
McCord
estimated the value of the index at that time as being be-
tween $15,000 to $25,000 in labor alone. During this week,
favorable National Agency Name Checks were concluded on Wiley
and Colonel Edwards and Colonel White had approved using
Security Office funds to total $10,000 in all, to continue
Wiley's indexing for one additional year. The partially
completed index was turned over to the Agency on 8 March 1956.

Following the approval of the project funding, McCord
contacted Lee Pennington, of the Americanism Committee of
the American Legion in Washington, D. C., asking, and
receiving wholehearted agreement, for Pennington to provide
cover for Wiley's work. The cover arrangements were so
concluded. It was made clear to Wiley that CIA was pur-
chasing the end product of his work and that he was not
now a CIA employee. However, McCord did advise Wiley that
he would attempt to secure Agency employment for him at the
conclusion of the project; and that in the coming year Wiley
should work on the indexing, continue regular contact with
his sources of information in New York City keeping the
Agency advised of anything that may be pertinent to our
areas of interest, and finally, build a cover story which
would enable Wiley to contact and interview various ex-
Communists and ex-Soviet agents in the New York area.

March 1956 June 1959
In mid-March 1956, through a letter by McCord extended
from his home address, arrangements were made for Wiley to
come to Washington, D. C., for three days to brief Hazel
Mackie, Personnel Pool (Office of Personnel), on certain
administrative matters for the processing and typing of the
index. The Personnel Pool work would result in 8 full copies
of the index: three copies to the Security Office, one copy
to Staff D, one copy to CI Staff, one copy for the FBI, one
copy for the American Legion and one copy for Wiley.
(It is presumed that a copy of the index was given to
the FBI; however, there is no document which could be located
that states a copy was in fact given to the FBI.)
Concurrent with McCord's interest in Wiley, he and
Morse Allen (SRS) were working on Operation Recovery, a
project set up in 1955 whose objective was gaining access
to and debriefing former and known agents of the inter-
national Communist movement who were involved in espionage
activities directly or indirectly against the U.S. Govern-
ment. Attendant to this operation, by April 1956, Wiley
at the request of McCord had completed:

:
Wiley was sent his first check covering the index pro-
ject on 9 April 1956. By 22 May 1956, he had met Morse
Allen.
McCord further reported on 1 May 1956 that during dis-
cussion with Wiley he told Wiley that there are three areas
in which he could work during the coming year (1956-57)
which would be of interest and would enhance his value to
CIA. One would be the continuation of the index project,
another would be the continuation of regular contact with
his sources of information in New York City, keeping CIA
advised of anything that may be pertinent to our areas of
interest. The third would be the building for him a cover
story which would enable him to contact and interview various
ex-Communists and ex-Soviet agents in the New York area.
Wiley told McCord that he, Wiley, was in contact with
Herbert Philbrick during the spring of 1956, and asked
McCord to work on getting him, Wiley, some (American)
Legion credentials. Wiley also enclosed reports on one
Alexander Koral. He stated he had begun taking Russian.

On 20 March 1957, McCord informed his supervisor that
Wiley's work on the index project would expire in May 1957.
McCord indicated he would like to use Wiley for another year
on the indexing project.
On 13 April 1957, Wiley tendered additional materials
from the indexing project; a copy of an article by Alfred
Kohlberg, "A Red Dream"; an open letter to the President
of the United States requesting either a new trial or par-
don for Morton Sobell, attaching a list of 200 signers; and
a list of publications and organizations fighting Communism
in the U.S. prepared by Herb Philbrick, given to Wiley.
Wiley was advised that he may be called upon soon to work
on some material on Soviet Espionage (David Dallin material,
a noted author of books on Soviet Intelligence), requiring
about one month's work; that he may be called upon to fol-
low the Albam (Jacob Albam) trial developments in the press;
and that an attempt would be made to renew his grant for
another year.

On 21 June 1957, Harlan A. Westrell, Chief, SRS, re-
quested the Director of Security for authorization to con-
tinue the Daily Worker indexing project for one year which
had yielded approximately 500,000 names in the index.
22 August 1957, Sheffield Edwards, Director of Security,
requested and received, such authorization for circa
$10,000 from the Deputy Director of Support.
On
During this period (1956-1959), Wiley worked with
Herbert Philbrick on a book which Philbrick was preparing
entitled "The Most Dangerous Group in the World." He also
was "building his cover" as a newspaperman and had numerous
contacts with Earl Browder (ex-chairman of the CPUSA).
From 5 to 19 January 1959, Wiley made a fact-finding
trip through the Mid-West and the Southeastern states of
the U.S. contacting newspapers, "conservative" individuals,
police agencies, and information repositories to determine
the extent of their information concerning Communism and
the Communist movement.
During the summer of 1959, SRS initiated and completed
2 study through wijev of the Columbia University newspaper,
"Spectator" and the City College of New York newspaper.
This, unlike the Daily Worker index, was a study of the
various issues for information pertaining to Communists
and radical organizations and individuals. Don Ingles,
Wiley's cousin, conducted the study and was paid for his
time.
Financial records indicate that the indexing project's
gross funding from March 1956 through May 1957 was $10,000.
Out of that amount, Wiley was given $8,600 in salary and the
other $1,400 was for expenses. The same total amount was
approved for the period June 1957 through May 1958 and was
expended as follows: $7,900 for salary payments and $2,100
for expenses. A like amount ($10,000) was set aside for
the period June 1958 through June 1959 and expended at the
rate of $734.17 per month in salary payments and the rest,
$265.83, in expenses.
In connection with the index, Wiley was also given
specific requests to compile reports on several individ-
uals and organizations which were of peripheral interest.

On 30 April 1958, Wiley prepared a report on his
contact (Charles Raphael) with the International Com -
mission of Jurists, and the location of possible files
on Soviet Espionage Commissioned by Philip Chancellor to
be gathered by Sidney McLaglen.
On 2 May 1958, Wiley prepared a report on his chance
meeting with Vladimir Oserov, Tass reporter.
Wiley reported that on 28 June 1958, he attended a
birthday cocktail party at the apartment of and for
Dr. J.B. Matthews, and identified others in attendance.
On 6 December 1956 (sic), Wiley reported receiving
a call from J.B. Matthews inquiring about Jack Rubenstein
(Rubinstein).
In the fall of 1958, Wiley reported meeting JoAnn
Mellors, from England, active in the anti-Communist organ-
ization Common Cause.
On 1 November 1958, Wiley prepared a report on the
"Linke Between the Anti-latomation League and the tra in
the Middle East," following a conversation with Michael
Rich.
On 8 December 1958, Wiley prepared a report on a
contact with Colonel Aharon Yariv, an Israeli Embassy
official. On 3 March 1959, this report was sent by
Helene Finan to James McCord and Clifton Carrico.
In March 1959, Wiley prepared four reviews of articles
appearing in 1941 and 1942 editions of Social Justice
Magazine pertaining to General Walter G. Krivitsky.
On 19 April 1959, Wiley prepared a report covering
his introduction to Haviv Shiber, General Secretary of
the Anti-Communist League in Israel. There is a notation
on the report that Wiley was going to give the informa-
tion also to the FBI.

On 1 July 1959, this Agency entered into contract
with Wiley, as an independent contractor, at the salary
rate of $9,100 per annum, with additional compensation
in the amount of 5% of the above sum, to be paid in
quarterly installments, representing the Government's
contribution toward Wiley's choice of programs for insur-
ance, retirement, medical and health. The contract speci-
fied that he would be reimbursed for operational travel
as directed by OS, and for other approved operational
expenses, subject to accounting applicable with Govern-
ment regulations.
The annual compensation was subsequently increased
on 1 July 1960 to $9,900 per annum and on 1 July 1961 to
$10,500 per annum, plus additional 5% as noted above.
Salary has remained at the latter level to the date of
his termination. The contract was to run for an inde-
finite neriod, and could be terminated without notice in
the event of a breach of contract or by Wiley rendering
himself unavailable for acceptable service, and could
otherwise be terminated by either Wiley or the Agency
with 90 days' notice.
From 1955 to 1959, Wiley was paid in cash, and for
several years after the contract was signed, officers of
SRS continued to pay Wiley his salary either in cash or
through bank money orders. In 1964 раyments of salary
were made by the Office of Finance directly into his bank
account in New York City.
From 1959 to the present time, SRS obtained a copy
of each year's Federal Income Tax Return, and on at least
two occasions, Wiley was given a personal briefing on the
management of the Agency funds, vis-a-vis income from his
self-established firm, World News Analysis, by Agency
Finance Officers. In 1964, because of his failure to
comply with the SRS's instructions to furnish complete
details on his claimed expenses, the regular payment of
"operational" expenses was terminated, necessitating that
he reduce expenses which were not reimburseable from the
firm's income.

Regarding his overseas travel, for the early years,
he was reimbursed in toto for travel expenses. However,
once World News Analysis had become established and had
acquired some regular source of income, the reimburse-
ments for his overseas travel was decreased, and only a
token contribution was made toward lengthy trips.

Shortly after Wiley signed his contract with this
Agency, he became involved in the World Youth Festival
(WYF) held in Vienna during July 1959.
A memo dated 19 February 1959 to the Acting Chief,
SRS, from Helene Finan (SRS) reports on a meeting between
Finan and Wiley at which Wiley furnished information rela-
tive to the forthcoming WYF to be held in Europe in mid-
summer 1959. According to this memo and an accompanying
one, Wiley said that Herb Romerstein (ex-Communist and
HCUA employee), with the aid of Alfred Kohlberg (NYC
importer and long-time anti-Communist activitist) and
Colonel Archibald Roosevelt, has a project extant to send
a delegation of 10 or more people to the WYF in Vienna in
July, along with the left-wing American delegation.
Romerstein, who is running the "show" for us (Finan's
words) has asked Wiley to help and Wiley will, but not in
an overt manner. Wiley told Romerstein the project was
his and Wiley should not be given any prominence. Wiley
and his wife will sign up next week. Don Sweeny (sic) of
the American Legion and several individuals from various
state police will also be among the group witting of the
project. The group, probably no more than 10 in all, will
attempt subtle propaganda, will sit singley throughout the
hall and interject controversial or embarrassing topics
into discussions. Wiley will play the role of the typical
American with his ever-ready camera.
Wiley will also work
on behalf of the I&NS in gathering names and pictures.
Helene Finan reported on 12 March 1959 to the AC/SRS
that Wiley will attend the WYF in Vienna in summer of 1959
for us (SRS). A 17 March 1959 memo states Wiley will leave
New York with the delegation on 20 June 1959. After the
Festival, the group (less Katina Wiley) plans to spend three
weeks in the USSR as members of the U.S. delegation to the
Festival. Wiley later changed his plans to include a visit
to Europe and the Middle East before and to Europe and Eng-
land after the Vienna and USSR phases of the trip.

On 18 May 1959, Morse Allen wrote a memo to the
Chief, SRS that Wiley is now a newspaperman and a maga-
zine writer, accredited under the auspices of the North
American Newspaper Alliance, the Spades Syndicate, The
Indianapolis Star, The Richmond Times Dispatch and pro-
bably several several other publications. Wiley is a member of
an anti-Communist group privately sponsored who will attend
the Vienna Youth Festival and will make themselves known
during the Festival. Wiley will probably cover the Festi-
val for the Newhouse Newspaper Chain, National Review and
U.S. News and World Report. He has received $500 in pri-
vate subscriptions to cover the cost of his transportation
to the WYF. The cost of his proposed itinerary amounts to
$1,056.70 for transportation.
Allen recommended the Office
of Security pay the additional cost of $556.70 with the
understanding that any remuneration received from his
writings be offset on an equitable basis.
On 19 May 1959, James McCord noted to Allen, "Ok, see
me,
referring to the request to approve the additional
cost and possible later offset. There is a 16 June report
From jier acknowledging receipt of $556.70.
The New York Times reported on 3 August 1959 that
Charles Wiley, his wife, and Joanne Mellor, a British sub-
ject living in New York City, were "roughed up" when they
attempted to join a parade of Eastern Bloc delegates to
the WYF. Wiley and company waited until the parade had
started and then unfolded their banners with such slogans
as "Remember Hungary," "Remember Tibet," and "What About
Soviet Imperialism?" That incident got much press cover-
age, particularly because Wiley's wife was obviously preg-
nant.
A 14 September 1959 memo for the record from Wiley
reflects that in a meeting with staff members of the HCUA,
Wiley was instrumental in talking HCUA out of holding
hearings which would be intended partially to expose the
alleged inept, but expensive, effort made by CIA to infii-
trate the WYF with a large group under cover of the Inde-
pendent Service Committee. The Director of Security memo-
randa concerning the foregoing was forwarded to the Legis-
lative Counsel on the 16th and 25th of September 1959 and
