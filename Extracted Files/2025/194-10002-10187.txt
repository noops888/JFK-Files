II. STRUCTURE OF THE VDC
SF T-2 on September 20, 1965. furnished a copy of
a mimeographed leaflet captioned, SUGGESTION FOR THE
STRUCTURE OF THE V.D.C. The leaflet set forth the follow-
ing information:
The Steering Committee of 30 will meet every Sun-
day night at open meetings, with the following purposes:
1.
2.
to make proposals to the Tuesday night
general membership meeting.
to carry out decisions of the membership."
The leaflet informed that all actions by the Steering Committee
would be announced at the opening of the Tuesday night meeting
of the general membership. According to the leaflet, the
general membership is the final authority on all policy deci-
sions.
The leaflet went on to inform that the basic working
arrangement of the VDC is that individual committees work
autonomously and make their own decisions within the general
framework of philosophy and allocation of resources as de-
cided by the Steering Committee and the general membership.
Continuing, the leaflet related that individual
committees must bring their actions to the Steering Com-
mittee and the membership when their actions are a matter
of political or organizational principle and large allocation
of resources. Voting in the Tuesday VDC meeting is based
exclusively on membership in the VDC, which is defined as
possession of a membership card and active work. According
to the leaflet, the Steering Committee is also empowered
to make and carry out day-to-day decisions of the VDC and to
choose a smaller committee or committees to do the same.
The leaflet commented that the general membership will set
the next date for election of a new Steering Committee.

PETER COHEN
SF T-5 has reported that on December 7, 1965, PETER
COHEN made the following statement in Berkeley:
The struggle to build the American re-
volution is as much a struggle to save
the human race from nuclear destruction
as it is one for socialism. America is
not a healthy society. I defend terrorism.
Bank robbery is fine, but it does little
to weaken the government: it only outs
money into hands of revolutionaries.
As
for the killing of President KENNEDY, shoot-
ing the President is a legitimate, left-
wing act of terror."
