Nationalcemokratische Partel. Deutschlands National Democratic Party of Germany)
Combined Deutsche Rechtspartei, Deutsche Reichspartei, the split off Sozialistiche
Reichspartei and the Deutsche Partei.
In August 1964 von Thaden arranged a meeting with other right-wingers to promote
unification of all nationalist forces. Friedrich Thielen served as both front
man and financial backer. A committee of 10 drafted a constitution which was
accepted in November 1964 by representatives of the DRP, DP, GLP and the DVNP (Deutsche-
National Volkspartei). The DRP officially disolved in December 1965 although the
NPD had, in fact, long been the nationalist party. At the 21 l'arch 1967 meeting
of the NPD Fxecutive Committee, the more moderato Thielen (former Deutsche Partei)
was ousted from the NPD by the more extreme von Thaden forces (CRP).. There was
no major rush to leave the NPD, however. Recent reporting hes indicated that those
who did leave the PD, even including Thielen, are being invited back into the NPD.

The Hitler Boom
by Charles Lam Markmann
Heidelbers
Had he irved Adolf Hitler would have been 85 years
old on April 20. And it was on this April 20 that the
forces responsible for the ouster of Chancellor Willy
Brandt-tor things must be called by their right names
-had almost tunished preparing West Germany for
her start on the short march back to the past One
hears everywhere "It we only had a strong man
again." On the fashionable North Sea resort island of
Sylt, Hitler's birthday was celebrated in the best Na-
tional Socialist style by several dozen Germans, none
gest 15, and all of them arrested on
ng circulated or displayed Nazı sym-
sung men wore brown shirts and swastika
nds; the girls frumped themselves up in the
dowdy blue shirts and white middy blouses of the
Bund deutscher Madein (League of German Girls), the
auxiliary of the Hitler Jugend. The walls of the room in
which they held their party were decorated with pic-
tures of fiitler and other National Socialist emblems
for which they had scoured Schleswig-Holstein. After
they had hstened to records of Hitler's and other Nazi
leaders' speeches and of old party march music, they
drank å toast to the Fuhrer.
When they were arrested, one of the young men
said the party had been planned merely as "ein guter
Gay." Perhaps so But for millions of other Germans
the re-creation of "the Nazi tume" is serious business
for some, because they want those good old days back,
and tor a tew because they tear the others may very
easily get their wish when the Federal Republic ot
Germany mast at last put its democracy to the test.
The fear is heightened by the steady and at times spec-
tacular rise im what is called die Hitlerwellethe Haler
wave, or Huler boom-which has kept pace with the
economic crisis, price levels and unemployment The
number of jobless has doubled since December
It is as much a Hitler and litler-associated boom as
a Nazi boom This is not to say that Nazi thinking has
no following in West Germany-quite the contrary..
as the letiers-to-the-editor columns of newspapers
demonstrate. in Bavaria-Nurnberg (indeed where
else?), in a 17th-century Franconian castle, a 25-man
"army" of voutis trains regularly, with the same steel
helmets and ret'es that the Wehomacht used t.om 1939
to 1945. Their leader is a sign-painter named Karl-
CHARLES LAM MARKMANN, Critic, wanslator and journal
ist, is at work on a boot about the two German republics.
JE I WP2.4.
Hems Heitmann, whose goals are simple the destruc-
bon of communism and big capital, the end of parha-
mentary rule, government by an unelected chte, the
annesation of Austria (which, as the Weimar Consti-
tution makes clear in Article ol, was also the goal of
the first German "republic"), and the reunification of
the Foieral Repubhe ot. Germany and the German
Democratic Republic.
There is a core of some 120,000 regular readers of the
Naria Zertung, which for two decades has been
whitewashing the Nazi era, "proving" that the only
concentration and extermination camps were those
built star the war by German prisoners under Ameri-
can orders, for propaganda purposes (there are even
pictures): promoting a brisk trade im Nart medals, uni-
torms weapons and other memorabila, as well as
books and recordings of speeches party congresses,
narrations or military campaigns (vectonous one.),
and engaging in a tanly subtle anti-Senutism. There
is no need for bratancy, after all the Jews were only the
tirst and most conspicuous of Nar targets Twelve
or so million non-Jews murdered by the Germans died
just as painfully-facts that are almost datly branded
as "hes" in letters to new papers, occastcally in dem-
onstrations, less infrequently in swastika-daubings
and cemetery vandalism
But these things-the Sylt bathday party. Hoff-
mann's army (which ought to be taken settously
the Nazi party's strength rose to seven members when
Hitler semed it), the National Zetting the "anoquan-
ans' whose windows and shops are tilied exclusively

more than 500 cars bearing registratan plates that,
atter the mandatory "B" tor Berlin), carry such letter
combiano as SS. SA, ill. 12 betore the various
nunurels. These designations-tor St.mscl..atzstaffel
(Elite Guards, Sturmabrehong (Stana Troops), Hitler
lugend, Konzentrazion-lager (concentration campi
have not been issued zoutinely. They are issued by
request, and Kart Koenig, the Social Democrat who
heads the city's Economics Department, the issuing
onice, explains that onder West German law such re-
quests cannot be retused. (I am not for one moment
inspring that the law should be revised: one does not
fight deas, or even baute hatreds, with muzzles.) The
same kinds of plates are visible in many other parts of
Federal Germany.
There are now in print literally thousands of paper
back titles dealing with every possible aspect of the
Third Reich and its personahties. There are serious,
analytical histories that sacritice success for integrity;
on the other hand two big, exhaustive, expensive bio
graphies of Hitler are selling more than well, and one.
of them, by loachim C. Fest, an editor of the arch-
reactionary. Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, has gone
well past 275.00 copies at almost $20 apiece-the
publishers have 25.00 more ready and waiting in
the warehouse. This book makes much of Hitler's
"modernity," httle of his barbarities: he was necessary
to his time. The other, which is much more overtly an
apologia-is by Werner Maser, who teaches the Hitler
era at the University of Munich. It has sold 30.000
copies. It endeavors to create the impression that, had
he not had certain problems arising out of misguided
medication in 1933, Hitler would have done more good
(and less harm).
In addition there are the big hardcover editions of
Hitler's speeches (four volumes) and Propaganda Min-
ister Paul Joseph Goebbels' (two volumes), four new
books about Rudolf Hess, Hitler's deputy who is now,
at 80, the last prisoner in Spandau, innumerable radio
and television programs dealing with various aspects
and personalities of the period, and, most lately, a fort-
nightly publication, Das dritte Rewch, planned to cover
the whole NS-Zeit for popülar consumption in two
years, and then expire.
The Alles especially the Americans-for a long
time torbade any mention whatever of the Hitler
period. and West Germany, once it became a more or
less miependent state, continued these bans for years.
Even more than other peoplés, Germans have the
touching notion that censorship and repression will
eftectively chainate ideas and facts; and, against this,
reither the ieft nor the right has the famtest concept
ot civil liberties, thus it is still torbidden, even though
the German Communist party has been legalized
again, to form a "Nazi" or "National Socialist" party.
Consequently the old SA and SS men organized the
totally Naži Nationaldemokratische Parter Deutschlands,
In England and in the US there has been a revival of
interest in the Hitler era paralleling the one in West
Germany At least 12 English and Amuscan publish-
ers have capitalized on this interest. Here's a sampling
ot theit recent books:

which, after some initial successes, took cover in the
hardly inhospitable Christian Democratic and Chris-
tian Social Unions but has recently announced its
determination to purge itself of this taipt." In
addition in spite of the constitutional ban (Article,
18) on any use of civil liberties to endanger the unde-
tined free democratic basic order," the state of Lower
Saxony alone has 34 active Fascist and Nazi organiza-
tions, publishing houses, and mail-order book dis
tributors. No one knows how many members and
customers they have because they operate furtively,
as the rather stupid law compels them to do Mut
(Courage), a monthly magazine addressing a frankly.
Fascist if not Nazi program to the young in that state,
has a circulation of 10.000 and is regarded by the
Lower Saxon Minister of the Interior as potentially or
latently dangerous.
Everywhere there is curiosity about those mysteri-
ous 12 years. The teachers who taught then are still
teaching, unless superannuated, but very few of them
dare to teach what they used to teach, or even to talk
about "the past." That is why Das drifte Rech was
founded this year: to make money out of that curiosity.
The idea was that or Hans-Peter Dietze, now its man-
aging editor, according to his editor-in-chief, Dr.
Christian Zentner, who stakes, a pious claim to a de-
site to show his young compatriots how the Third
Reich carne to pass, in order to prevent its ever hap-
pening again. After four issues, Dr. Zentner is not so
sure that his publisher, the big Hamburg house of
John Jahr Verlag KG, will do much more than break
even, because, he told me, what millions of people are
insatiably interested in is not "the abstractions" of
nazism and its history but its personalities, and in
particular Adolf Hitler. These, he says, are "simple
people who do not read books but who watch televi-
sion and read magazines, and it was they whom he set
out to capture to clarify the past for them.
His magazine is expensive - about $1.50 a copy. A
tremendous advertising campaign, of dubious taste,
resulted in first-issue sales some 150,000 above the
250.000 copies that the editors and publishers ex-
pected. The second issue sold between 330 000 and
340.000 copies, the third something over 250,000 so
far, and the fourth which is still on the newsstands-
more than 200,000. The overwhelming majority of the
purchasers and subscribers, Zentner admits, seems to
include few of those young people he was looking for.
the real circulation is among the people old enough to
remember, the Nazis who write furious letters to the
editor because he tarnishes their legends. Both Dietze
and Zentner fold me that the greatest sales of Das
dritte Reich are not in cities but out in the country and
the small towns, in Bavaria and Franconia especially.
One of the reasons for the phenomenal success of a
television program called "Ein Herz und eine Seele"
("One Heart and One Soul") is its enthusiastically en-
joyed derogations of the sub-men, by name: the Slavs,
the lows, the Latins, the Levantines A German exag-
geration ot "All-in the Family, the program plays also
on the hysterical dread of the Communists" that has
been endemic here ever since the general staft real-
ized in 1918 that it had made a terrible mistake in
helping Lenin'in 1917. Ex-Chancellor Willy Brandt was
a constant target because of his illegitimate birth and
his "traitorous" conduct from 1935 to 1915, when he
fought against nazisin, as well as his "selling out" to
"the Reds." The program regularly attracts 60-65 per-
cent of the national audience, and only an occasional
editorial writer or cotamentator dates to see its popu-
lanty for the darger it is. Its "lett-liberal" creator,
Wolfgang Menge, claims it to be a satire and so recog-
nized because people say its protagonist, Althed Tet-
zlaff, sounds just the Franz Josef Strauss, the head of.
the CSU: but then in each regional election this year
more of them vote tor the Strausses.
In mid-March the Bavarian State Radio and Televi-
sion broadcast a long interview with Hitler's (and
Franklin Roosevelt'sa old hiend, Ernst (Putz) Hant-
staengl, who is now S. Though in the end-through a
rather gruesome practical joke he felt he had to dee
to the United States in 1997, and was matenalty as-
sisted by Roosevelt, his old Harvard classmate, in
gaining entry (later he became an adviser on policy to
the American forces). Hanfstaengi spent his whole
tume on camera telling what ime fellows Hitler, Goer-
ing, Goebbels, Himmler and the others really were,
when all was said and done-and masters of their
trades to boct: fine solchets, gentuses at propaganda,
und so weiter. Thear Weimar predecessors he belittled
and dismissed as nothings, though he admitted he
had never known much about their aspirations or
their achievements. Moreover in spite of having, with
his wife and sister. lavishly and almost single.
mindedly supported Hitler from the days before the
1923 Munchen. Pris, to his own abrupt departure for,
the decadent democracy, itentstaengi insisted that he

ever amount to anything serious ("some of my best
friends were..."). on titat is protege would ever have

The real danger et a finder renascence, in the view
of Dr. Huga Mare, a scholar who surfered under the
original, lies in the combination of a tomanne nostal-
gia and the millennas Geranan taith in authoritanan
rule as the solution to all problems Weimar, ater all,
failed primanly, as both William B. Shirer and Karl
Dietrich Bracher have shown, because no one, includ-
ing the Social Democrats who proclaimed it out of
desperation when they could find neither a Hohen-
zollern nor any other royalty to accept the throne,
wanted a repubhs. When the economic crash came
after 1929, the millennial search for the "strong man"
lost its last restraint.

1. The executive committee of the West German National
Democratic Party (NPD) will meet on 18 March with officials
of the Baden-Wuerttemberg NPD organization and attempt to
persuade the Land organization not to contest the 23 April
Land election. The executive committee will point out that
if the NFD does not run candidates in this election, the
chances for the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) to obtain a
majority in the Baden-Wuerttemberg election will be enhanced.
This would enable the CDU to retain its Bundesrat majority
and improve the chances of defeating the Eastern treaties of
the Social Democratic Party/Free Democratic Party government.
2. The background of the executive committee's desire
to avoid contesting the Baden-Wuerttemberg election is its
estimate that the NPD would capture only two per cent of the
vote this year compared with 9.4 per cent in the last
election, a result which the executive committee is most
anxious to avoid.

2. VON THADDEN BEGINS BY TRACING THE HISTORY OF
THE UNITED STATES' RELATIONSHIP WITH GERMANY FROM WORLD
WAR I TO THE PRESENT, DEVOTING CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION ΤΟ
THE 1929 STOCK MARKET CRASH. HÈ GIVES CREDIT TO THE
UNITED STATES FOR HELPING EUROPE BACK ON ITS FEET AFTER
WORLD WAR 11 THROUGH THE MARSHALL PLAN. BUT POINTS OUT
THAT THE NATIONS WHICH WERE HELPED USED THE AID TO BUILD
AN EXPORT BASE WHICH NOW IS CONTRIBUTING TO AMERICA'S
FINANCIAL TROUBLES. HE SAYS THAT GERMANY AND OTHER.
COUNTRIES BECAME INFECTED WITH AN "EXPORT HYSTERIA"
AFTER THE WAR WHICH HAD SHORT TERM BENEFITS FOR WORLD
TRADE, BUT WHICH IN THE LONG RUN DAMAGED THE DOMESTIC
ECONOMIES OF THE EXPORTING COUNTRIES.
3. THE 15 AUGUST 1971 SPEECH BY PRESIDENT NIXON IS
COMPARED WITH THE 24 OCTOBER 1929 STOCK MARKET CRASH,

IN HIS ANALYSIS OF THE TYPE OF WOF.LD ECONOMIC
SYSTEM WHICH SHOULD FOLLOW THE CURRENT AMERICAN CONTROLS
AND FLOATING OF THE DOLLAR, VON THADDEN DRAWS HEAVILY FROM
THE 23 SEPTEMBER PRESS CONFERENCE OF FRENCH PRESIDENT POMPIDOU..
HE SAYS THAT THE DOLLAR CAN NO LONGER BE CONSIDERED THE
SINGLE WORLD CURRENCY. THE PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY OF EUROPE
MAKES IT NECESSARY THAT A EUROPEAN RESERVE CURRENCY BE
AVAILABLE AS A SECOND WORLD CURRENCY. THIS CANNOT BE
THE BRITISH POUND AS MANY PEOPLE AT ONE TIME WOULD HAVE
BELIEVED, BUT MUST BE A CURRENCY ACCEPTED BY BOTH FRANCE
AND GERMANY AND ADMINISTERED BY A COMMON GERMAN-FRENCH
BANK SUPPORTED BY GOLD. ALL EUROPEAN STATES WOULD USE
THIS BANK FOR INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS.
VON THADDEN VIEWS POMPIDOU'S SPEECH AS A SIGNAL TO THE
UNITED STATES THAT THE FRENCH ARE NOT WILLING TO STAY
PERMANENTLY UNDER ECONOMIC PRESSURE FROM WASHINGTON, AND
AS PROVIDING AN OUTLINE OF THE TYPE OF ECONOMIC ORDER
EUROPE SHOULD HAVE IN THE FUTURE. HE CRITICIZES THE WEST
GERMAN GOVERNMENT FOR NOT TAKING A SIMILAR STAND, SAYING
THAT WHEN IT IS POSSIBLE FOR ONE STATE TO PUT ECONOMIC
PRESSURE ON OTHER STATES, THE SITUATION CAN LEAD TO
