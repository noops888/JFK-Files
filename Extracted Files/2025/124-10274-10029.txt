In connection with our responses to
the Senate Select Committee (SSC), the
White House has instructed that the Intel-
ligence Community prepare a briefing for
Senators Church and Tower of the SSC
regarding warrantless electronic surveil-
lances and surreptitious entries. During
meetings of the Intelligence Community, it
was agreed that NSA, FBI and CIA would give
the briefings. No date has been scheduled
for the briefings, although it is antici-
pated representatives of the White House
will monitor a preview of the actual brief-
ing to be given Senators Church and Tower.
During meetings of the Intelligence
Community representatives, to discuss the
contents of such a briefing, it was agreed
among representatives of NSA, CIA and FBI
that efforts would be made to avoid identi
fying specific foreign targets of surrepti
tious entries or warrantless electronic
surveillances.
Attached is a memorandum from CIA
advising that CIA has already disseminated
to the SSC information concerning sensitive
technical operations against certain
Embassies and diplomatic establishments in
the U.S.(S

On 8/6/75, Daniel M. (Mac) Armstrong, III, who was
on the personal staff of former Acting Director Gray, called to advise
that he had been contacted by John Elliff. He had known Elliff casually
during the confirmation hearings regarding Mr. Gray. Elliff told him
that he was personally interested in determining background on two matters
which were: (1) the decision to abolish the Crime Records Division; and
(2) the Legal Attache program.
Armstrong told him that he had no knowledge concerning the
Crime Records Division and had not even learned of its abolishment until
after the fact. Armstrong referred Elliff to Dave Kinley regarding that
topic. Armstrong said that Elliff did not want to talk to him concerning the
Legal Attache program over the phone and said he would contact him in the
near future for an appointment to see him personally.
Armstrong said he was passing this information along to us in
order to keep us advised of his contacts with the Senate Select Committee
concerning his Bureau information which came to him as a result of his
Bureau employment.

1. In our discussions preparatory to the briefing to
be given to Senators Church and Tower, we have agreed to try
to avoid identifying specific foreign gn targets of the various
types of operations which will be discussed, although it was
generally recognized that it would be impossible to avoid
discussing the Soviet target specifically. I have recently
learned that the SSC Staff is aware of the fact (from materiall
turned over to them by CIA) that CIA "participated in a series
of electronic surveillance operations in the U.S." The infor-
mation is contained in a single paragraph, which goes on to
say:
"Included among them are ope
e operations against the
Czech Embassy, the UAR Embassy, the Chilean Embassy,
the Soviet Consulate in San Francisco, the present
Soviet Embassy, the planned Soviet Embassy, and the
quarters occupied by the Chinese Communists in New
York City."

2. This being so, it can be expected that the Staff will
have brought this information to the senators' attention, and
I will be prepared to respond factually to questions with re-
spect to these operations, which of course were carried out in
pursuit of NSA requirements, and with FBI coordination an and/or
support.

3. Notwithstanding this regrettable breach in the priNG 15 1975
ciple we have agreed to try to maintain, I believe we should
resist pressures to expand on the number of identified target s
