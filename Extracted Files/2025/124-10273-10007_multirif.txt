This memorandum reports the receipt of a legal ||
memorandum prepared by Mr. Edmund Cohen, Office of the General HOT
Counsel, Central Intelligence Agency, entitled "Authority of
Congress to Release Classified Data." Copies of this legal
memorandum have been furnished to Mr. Anthonin Scalia, Assistant
Attorney General, and Mr. James A. Wilderotter, Associate Counsel
to the President.
Memorandum Cregar to W. R. Wannall dated 4/14/75 discussed
an article contained in the 4/10/75 edition of "The Washington Post"
wherein Senator Frank Church, Chairman of the Senate Select
Committee, stated he reserved the right to make public any documents
the Committee received. This memorandum also noted that Mr. James
Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to the President, advised that
The White House was preparing a letter to Senator Church recognizing
that Congress can, at its discretion, declassify material it
receives, but strongly urging that such declassification action
not be taken unilaterally by the Senate Select Committee without
approval of the agency originating the information.
As an aid to the preparation of such a letter, the
Office of CIA's General Counsel has prepared a paper entitled
"Authority of Congress to Release Classified Data." Copy attached.
It was made available to all members of the Ad Hoc Coordinating
Group for Congressional Review of the Intelligence Committee for
information and any comments recipients desired to make.

: Authority of Congress to Release Classified Data
:
1. I have found no express authority for Congress to publicly release
information classified by the executive branch pursuant to an Executive
order issued by the President. Moreover, on a number of occasions Congress
has mandated that matters pertaining to national defense or foreign policy
be kept secret,
:
:
--Congress has made it a crime for one lawfully having possession,
access or control of documents relating to national defense or infor-
mation relating to the national defense which the possessor has
reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States
or to the advantage of any foreign nation to communicate, deliver,
or transmit same to any person not entitled to receive it. 18
U.S.C.A. 793(d),
--Congress has made it a crime to disclose to an unauthorized per-
son or publish any classified information obtained by the processes
of communications intelligence. 18 U.S.C.A. 798(a).
--Congress has made it a crime to photograph or sketch vital military
or naval installations or equipment requiring protection against gen-
eral dissemination of information. 18 U.S.C.A. 795. It is also a
crime to publish or disseminate photographs, maps, or drawings of.
such defense installations without first obtaining permission of the
commanding officer or higher authority. 18 U.S.C.A. 797..
--Congress, in order to prevent public disclosure of certain activities,
has given various officials the power to keep confidential certain funds
expended for national security or foreign relations purposes. Such
authority is given, for example, to the President (22 U.S.C.A. 2364),
to the Secretary of State (31U.S.C.A. 107), and to the Director of
Central Intelligence (50) U.S.C.A、403j).
::
NW.88296 DocId:32989532 Page.......
--Congress has provided that meetings of the Senate Committee on
the Budget may be closed to the public if it is determined by a record
vote of a majority of the members that the matter to be discussed
...will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in the
interest of national defense or the confidential conduct of
the foreign relations of the United States. 2U.S.C.A..
190a-3.
--Congress, after requiring that the Secretary of State transmit forth-
with to the Congress the text of any international agreement, other
than a treaty, to which the United States is a party, goes on to pro-
vide that
...any such agreement the immediate public disclosure
of which would, in the opinion of the President, be prej-
udicial to the national security of the United States shall
not be so transmitted to the Congress but shall be trans-
mitted to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate
and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Rep-
resentatives under an appropriate injunction of secrecy to
be removed only upon due notice from the President.
1U.S.C.A. 112b.
--Finally, Congress, in enacting the Freedom of Information Act,
expressly exempted from disclosure matters which are
...specifically authorized under criteria established
by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest
of national defense or foreign policy. 5U.S.C.A.
552(b)(1).
2. Despite this apparent lack of authority to release classified data
and the existence of the above-mentioned statutes, Congress is constitutionally
immunized, at least in part, against any consequences flowing from release
and disclosure of classified information. Article I, § 6 of the Constitution
states in respect to Senators and Representatives that:
...for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall
not be questioned in any other Place.
NW 88296 Docld:32989532 Page 6
2.
3. A long line of Supreme Court cases, beginning with Kilbourn v.
Thompson, 103 U.S. 168 (1990), has held that the privilege or immunity
relating to speech or debate should be given a broad and liberal construc-
țion, In Kilbourn the court stated:
It would be a narrow view of the Constitutional provision
to limit it to words spoken in debate. The reason of the
rule is as forcible in its application to written reports
presented in that body by its committees, to resolutions
offered, which, though in writing, must be reproduced
in speech, and to the act of voting.... In short, to things
generally done in a session of the House by one of its
members in relation to the business before it. (At p. 204.)
:
4. The court, moreover, has resisted arguments that an unworthy
purpose should destroy the privilege. In Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U.S.
367 the court reaffirmed its earlier holding in Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch
87 (1810), stating:
...that it was not consonant with our scheme of govern-
ment for a court to inquire into the motives of legislators,
has remained unquestioned. (At.p. 377.)
The distance to which the court was willing to go to uphold this principle
was seen in United States v. Johnson, 383 U.S. 169 (1966). In that case
a former Congressman was convicted for conspiracy to defraud the U.S.,
in part on evidence that, in pursuance of a conspiracy designed to give
assistance to certain savings and loan associations which had been indicted
en mail fraud charges, he was paid to give a speech on the floor of the House.
The Supreme Court granted a new trial holding that a prosecution which
draws in question the legislative acts of the defendant member of Congress
er his motives for performing them "necessarily contravenes the Speech or
Debate Clause." (At p. 185.)
5. The court addressed the issue of classified information in Gravel v.
United States, 408 U.S. 606 (1972), a case which arose when Senator Gravel,
Chairman of the Subcommittee on Buildings and Grounds of the Senate Public
Works Committee, convened a night meeting of the Subcommittee and there
read extensively from a copy of the Pentagon Papers which bore a Defense
security classification of Top Secret Sensitive. He then placed the entire
47 volumes of the study in the public record. Senator Gravel claimed that
Article I, section 6 protected him from criminal or civil liability and from
NW-88296-DocId:32989532-Page-7-
3
questioning elsewhere than in the Senate, with respect to the events occur-
'ring at the Subcommittee hearing at which the Pentagon Papers were intro-
duced into the public record. The court stated: ".../T/o us this claim is
incontrovertible." (Atp. 615.)
6. The court further noted that:
The Speech or Debate Clause was designated to assure
a co-equal branch of the government wide freedom of
speech, debate, and deliberation without intimidation
or threats from the Executive Branch. It thus protects
Members against prosecutions that directly impinge
* upon or threaten the legislative process. We have no
doubt that Senator Gravel may not be made to answer--
either in terms of questions or in terms of defending
himself from prosecution--for the events that occurred
at the subcommittee meeting. (At p. 616.)
7. From the above, together with the positive phrasing of Article 1,
§ 6 of the Constitution, it would appear that any Member may make any state-
ment he desires on the floor of the Congress or in one of its committees. Such
statement shall be absolutely privileged, notwithstanding that it was based
on information secured from classified Central Intelligence Agency material
either furnished the Member in confidence or containing any restrictive
notice as to use or dissemination. This privilege would operate if the Member
were to read the information verbatim into the record on the floor or into
the record of hearings before a congressional committee. It would still be
privileged when it appeared, verbatim, in the Congressional Record or in
the published hearings of a congressional committee. The only sanction,
apart from the individual conscience and sense of responsibility of the Member,
would have to come from Congress itself, which has the power to discipline
any Representative or Senator who improperly disclosed classified information.
8. One additional wrinkle might be noted. Although Congressmen
would be immune from liability for introducing classified information into
a committee report and immune from liability for ordering it printed and
disseminated to the public at large, the Public Printer and the Superintendent
of Documents may not be immune from suit for printing and disseminating
such reports to the public. The court examined this question in Doe v.
McMillan, 412 U.S. 306(1973), a case in which petitioners claimed that a
report issued by the House Committee on the District of Columbia, containing
NW-88296 Docld:32989532 Page 8
4
documents relating to disciplinary problems of certain specifically named
students, violated statutory, constitutional and common-law rights to pri-
vacy. The Supreme Court refused to determine whether dissemination to
the public would serve the important legislative function of informing the
public concerning matters pending before Congress for the purpose of
holding Members of Congress liable. However, it remanded the case to
the Court of Appeals, in part to undertake just such a review in order to
determine whether the Public Printer and the Superintendent of Documents.,
who were without blanket immunity, could be held liable..
:
:
9. The discussion thus far has dealt only with congressional immunity
for releasing classified information in Congress. No such immunity exists
in the case of disclosures made by congressmen outside of Congress. Thus,
in Long v. Ansel, 69 F.2d 386 (Ct. App., D.C. 1934), affd. 293 U.S. 76
(1934), and in McGovern v. Martz, 182 F. Supp. 343 (US Dist. Ct., D.C..
1960) it was held that if a Senator or Representative is alleged to have com-
mitted libel by republishing and disseminating remarks made in the Congress,
such republication and dissemination is not within the Speech or Debate
privilege even if such privilege would have been applicable to the original
publication of the remarks. Again, in Gravel v. United States, 408 U.S. 606
(1972), and in Doe v. McMillan, 412 U.S. 306 (1973) the court noted that
the Speech or Debate Clause does not protect "à private republication of
documents introduced and made public at a committee hearing, although the
hearing was unquestionably part of the legislative process."
10. From the above it is apparent that a Member is not privileged to
circulate CIA documents to his constituents, to the press, or by reading to:
a meeting or on radio or television. Such action could well make the member
liable for prosecution under the espionage laws, but in any event would
expose him to the same liability for these actions as any other citizen. As
a practical matter, however, the prosecution of a Member for unauthorized
disclosure of classified CIA material, or disciplinary action by Congress
itself, is very unlikely.
