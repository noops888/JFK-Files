4. Again for Headquarters only is a sketch GSFEW/1 gave the Station
on 23 September 1970 which shows the proposed UHF radio system expansion
which was tho subject of Reference C. Portions circled with red poncil
are the planned oxpansions.

5. Regarding a SRAC system for GSFEW/1's use in Tripoli. Per
Station's request that approval be given to lease another apartment in
his building would certainly onablo him to transmit from his own to the
oafe apartment. He could be provided with an appropriate radio (he
:
already possesses two tapo recorders) for this purpose. GSFEW/1 does not 02
have a radio in his car but could have one installed and arrangements
made for him to transmit to NEUWIRTH's residence. The latter is located
a half block from a main thoroughfare that GSFEW/1 could frequently and U2
naturally use to get him to various locations in Tripoli. NEUWIRTH's.
residence is also about a block and a half from Iden P where GSFEW/1 02
makes a habit of stopping each Friday evening during the "happy hour."
He drives to the Iden P, as do other WOCORKERS, and after parking his car
could transmit before entering the Iden P. GSFEW/1 also has a TV set, 02
in the event this could be modified as a SRAC device, but it must be taken
into consideration that the Libyan programs are only presented during
ovening hours. The Station also has another safehouse apartment in the
Idon building which is also located on a busy thoroughfare and a street
07GSFEW/1 would also have need to take in handling business and shopping
Jaffairs. NEUWIRTH has been planning to have a radio placed in this
apartment(for use during meetings with Station assets.
02
6. Although GSFEW/1 would often use SRAC only for transmitting
purposes, and it would not be necessary to query him on the information he
reported, two-way voice communications would probably be essential in
those instances where he had technical and other fairly complicated data
to relay which would necessitate his case officer being able to make
cortain it is understood and does not require clarification and/or
amplification.

Other information concerning the GSFEW/1 activity will follow
by separate dispatch.
