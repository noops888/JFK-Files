3331 HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING, ANNEX 2
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20515
October 16, 1978
Dear Bob:
As you probably know, because the Committee is winding down, the
decision has been made to terminate L. J.'s services as of October 31.
I'm sure that you are wondering how you stand salary-wise with the
Committee because of the duplicate salary payments from the New Orleans
Police Department.
The following are my calculations of how you stand.
You were hired August 15, 1977 at an annual salary of $24,000.00
and taken off the payroll February 28, 1978. Your W-2 statement for
1977 gave a salary of $16,637.46 from the New Orleans Police Department.
The monthly amount would be $1,386.46 ($16,637.46 12). Prorating this
amount would give $9,058.21 while on the payroll of the Committee ($1,386.46
per month for the period August 15, 1977 to February 28, 1978).
You have been due $613.54 per month from the Committee since March 1,
1978 (the difference between your Committee salary of $2,000.00 per month
and $1,386.46). Dividing $613.54 into $9,058.21 (the overpayment referred
to above) would carry you almost 15 months or until June 1, 1979.
According to the affidavit from your payroll supervisor, your base pay
during the period you have been with the Committee is $1,273.00 per month.
If we use this lower figure instead of the $1,386.46 which I got by divid-
ing the amount on your W-2 by 12 and I went through the same calculations
as above, the overpayment would carry you about 112 months or until Feb-
ruary 15, 1979.
Either way, the duplicate payment by the New Orleans Police Depart-
ment for the period August 15, 1977 to February 28, 1978 is more than
enough to carry you through December 31, 1978 without any further payments
from the Committee.
Please give me a call if you have any questions or dispute any of my
figures.
TH:ht
Sincerely yours,
Jom

Oct. 30, 1978
Dear Tom:
I recieved your letter of Oct. 16, 1978 and agree with
your last figures which indicate my base pay as $1,273.00
per month. The W-2 form includes overtime and uniform al-
lowances that are not subject to Committee Consideration.
This still leaves me paid until Feb. 15, 1979. This is not
accurate due to insufficient data given to you.
The following will explain my present position.
The City of New Orleans allows employees to accrue annual
leave at the rate of 21 days per year (1 3/4 per month).
This
annual leave can be accumulated for a maximim of 90 days and
be carried from one year to the next. In 1977 I ended the year
with 102 days of which 12 days was dropped from the rolls due
to committee employment. These are all working days, for each
five totaled I recieve 2 days off, similar to a week end. In
1978 I will lose 21 days (working) from the rolls. This is
33 working days or 6 weeks and 3 days (33 5 6 X 7 + 3 =45).
The 33 days from the City amounts to $1,937.66 at $7.34
per hour. This amount does not take into account the number
of weeks nor the 14 days annual leave that the committee would
allow. The total consecutive days would be 45 + 14 = 59.
This would be one day short of two months at $2,000.00 per
month from the Committee. You can see that this could get
into an accountant problem.
I am suggesting that the Committee not pay me anything
further in salary but that I be given the above stated time
off. I would like to be off from Nov. 15 thru Dec 31. 1978.
I would still be avialable to get needed information to help
write the report (if the Committee continues my phone service)
I am not an accountant and would rather not get into the
dollars and cents involved. The time off would be practical
solution in my opinion.
I will talk with you and Cliff further about this matter.
Sincerely In Christ
Singege
