Two MVD Officers in Minsk Who Are Engaged in the
Surveillance of Foreigners
(201-0948382). A foreign-language student from Minsk
who worked in various jobs throughout the USSR. Born in
1949, he emigrated in 1976. Neither his bona fides nor
his reporting reliability has been established.

1. The two MVD officers described in this report are part of
a small (and otherwise unidentified) section of the Minsk City
Internal Affairs Directorate (GUVD) on Dobromyshlenskiy pereulok
(the subject of a separate report). This section is engaged in
the surveillance of foreigners for the apparent purpose of identify-
ing those of their Soviet contacts who may be black marketeers.
2. KOVALEV, Vladimir, whose nickname is "Boni", holds the
rank of senior lieutenant. Born in about 1949, he is 174 cm tall,
of medium build, and has slightly wavy short blond hair. He is
very nearsighted and wears glasses. He dresses modestly and
inconspicuously and has the appearance of an "educated and cultured"
person.
3. KOVALEV is married to Tamara nee MATVEYEVA, and they have
a son, born in about 1972, who attends a special kindergarden for
the children of high-ranking and other privileged officials.
KOVALEVA, the daughter of a retired KGB lieutenant colonel, is a
graduate of an economics institute and works as a senior economist
for the State Committee for Standards, earning 170 rubles per month.
The KOVALEVS live on Bobruyskaya ulitsa directly opposite a bus
station.
4. KOVALEV is a graduate of the Minsk State Pedagogical
Institute of Foreign Languages, where he studied Spanish and English
in the Department of Translating. After graduation, KOVALEV left
Minsk for one year to go into the Army. However, Source found this
hard to believe, as he knew that KOVALEY had been turned down for
military service in 1966 because of nearsightedness. During the
time that KOVALEV was in the Army, his wife told Source that where
her husband was serving "they put army boots on once a month, just
for show." KOVALEV's military service card (voyennyy bilet).
nevertheless indicates both his 1966 rejection and the year that he
supposedly spent in the Army."
5. Source believes Reec Kovaley's father-in-law was instrumental

in his choice of a career and probably helped KOVALEV through
his own connections. (Fnu MATVEYEV, the father-in-law, had once
been an important KGB official in the Belorussian SSR.) Source
also believes that KOVALEV, while he is an MVD officer, has close
tles with the KGB and may have been co-opted by ft. He bases this
belief on KOVALEV's close and frequent association with Anatoliy
AKSENOV, a KGB lieutenant (the subject of a separate report).
Yubileynaya, a hotel where foreigners stay, is apparently one of
KOVALEV's assignments, as he is frequently seen there.
The
6. (Fnu) PINYAZ is the MVD officer who works with KOVALEV.
Born in about 1945, PINYAZ' is of average height and build, has
short blond hair, gray eyes, and dresses'simply in an apparent
effort to be inconspicuous. During a drinking session, PINYAZ'
admitted to Source that he "cooperates closely" with the KGB.
PINYAZ' is frequently seen at the Hotel Turist

of Socialist Property and Speculation (OBKhSS) is concerned
with protecting socialist property in state establishments such
as
stores, plants and factories, hotels and restaurants. The
following OBKHSS personalities were known to Source: (fnu)
MALYSHKO and (fnu) POLYANSKIY in the Frunze ROVD, (fnu) KELLER

Soviet citizens not engaged in socially productive labor are
first given a warning, which they must sign at the department.
If they remain unemployed, their case is turned over to a court,
and the offense is punishable by a sentence of up to two years.
However, there are ways to get around the law. Source says...
that if it can be shown that parents or a spouse are providing
support or if a person can get seasonal work, he can defend
himself before the department. But most citizens are not aware
of these loopholes, according to Source. After the Investigations
Department, this militia department turns over the greatest
number of citizens to the courts. Also, this department and
the law that it enforces are frequently used against dissidents.

SUBJECT: Selection and Recruitment of KGB Officers, Agents and
Informers in the Belorussian SSR
SOURCE
(201-0948382), a foreign-language student from ask who
worked in numerous jobs throughout the USSR. Born in 182.
he emigrated in 1976. Neither his bona fides gor his
reporting reliability has been established
DATE OF INFORMATION: 1972-1976
DATE OF INTERVIEW

Source obtained most of the information in this report from
Anatoliy Aleksandrovich AKSENOV, a KGB senior lieutenant who was in
charge of the KGB unit in the Yubileynaya Hotel in Minsk, and from
friends and classmates who are now KGB and militia officers.
2. Source's curiosity about the selection and recruitment of KGB
personnel was aroused when AKSENOV told him that he was considering
the recruitment of Source as a KGB informant. Source asked AKSENOV
who is selected and for what reasons. AKSENOV replied that the KGB
usually uses spotters, who recommend people for recruitment. Back-
ground is important. A person from a peasant or worker's family is
considered a better choice, and he must either be a quiet and colorless
type who blends into the circle of people in which he operates, or
else a conspicuous loudmouth who asks embarrassing questions. The
latter would be more likely suspect of being a member of the opposi-
tion rather than a KGB informant. The average informant, according
to AKSENOV, is not very bright because KGB officers themselves are
not particularly intelligent and are afraid of anyone who is smarter
than they. Source says that he was never recruited.
:
3. Both Source and AKSENOV think that in the remote areas of the
USSR there are very few cases of such a recruitment pitch being
turned down. Far from the big cities the KGB is an all-powerful
instrument, and anyone who refuses just to report on the conversations
of his friends in the name of patriotism will end up with dismal
career prospects unless he has friends in high places. However, it
is unlikely that such a person would be chosen for a KGB recruitment
pitch in the first place. Therefore most of the lower levels of the
KGB consist of people from simple backgrounds for whom there are no
other career prospects and who prefer this kind of service to being
in the Army.
4. The KGB officers in the Belorussian SSR are also those who
are not bright enough to make a career in some other field, such as
science, engineering, or foreign languages, but they differ from
the lower-level cadres in that they are the sons of high-ranking
gh-ranking,

Party and government officials. This is why so many sons of
Belorussian dignitaries work for the KGB. Otherwise they would be
doomed to jobs which would pay ha, et rost, 120 rubles per month
for the rest of their lives, even if they could survive the competi
tion in a Party job. In the KGB, an officer, who achieves such
status by going through a school, can look forward to steady
promotions until he reaches the rank of major And if his sponsor
retains his influence, the officer can eventually be promoted to
lieutenant colonel or even colonel before retiring. Also, it is a
prestigious, interesting, and financially advantageous job which
places the KGB officer above the common people to the point where
many officers consider themselves to be above the law. Their
salaries are often supplemented by discreet cooperation with black
marketeers, who pay off either in goods or a percentage of the take.
And there are the services of the women who sleep with foreigners.
for money or for other considerations, and who report to the KGB
So a person like AKSENOV, responsible for a large tourist hotel like
the Yubileynaya, actually presides over a small kingdom.
5. A KGB officer meets each of his agents (filer was the word
used by Source) in a safe house (konspirativnaya kvartira). Other
officers are not supposed to know who these agents are, and this
"conspiracy" is a matter of great pride to them. Source was once
caught leaving the hotel room of a Bulgarian girl with whom he had
spent the night, but he was released when he gave AKSENOV's name to
the junior KGB officer on duty (thereby implying that Source was on
assignment for AKSENOV).
6. Source described KGB influence as "overwhelming". For example,
a Soviet going abroad on an official assignment cannot refuse to
cooperate with the KGB because such refusal would mean that the
person wouldn't be able to travel, o travel, as the KGB has a say about his
final clearance. Source also gave the example of an applicant for an
unimportant job with the Minsk Symphony who was originally turned
down. But when AKSENOV spoke to the KGB officer responsible for the
Symphony, the applicant was not only hired but received the greatest
respect from the Symphony Director during the entire period of his
employment.
7. The KGB likes to recruit retired military personnel (otstavniki)
because they are considered politically reliable and patriotic.
Many otstavniki recruited by the KGB are former Osobyy otdel (Special
Section, security functions) people, so KGB work is not a novelty for
them. Such retirees are frequently used in stationary positions,
reporting on or guarding specific areas.
8. Since the KGB relies on spotters for the selection of its
agents, the spotters themselves can get into trouble if they recommend
the "wrong" person. This means that the spotters are afraid to select
clever people, so in the end they select mediocre ones. Selection
is determined by the following: If the prospective agent or informer
is a kolkhoznik, he is immediately 50% qualified. If he was in the
Army, particularly in the Osobyy otdel, this adds another 30%.
qualifications are based on the person's being "quiet", "average",
or "ordinary".

(201-0948382) A foreign language student from Minsk,
who worked in numerous jobs throughout the USSR.
Born
in 1949, he emigrated in 1976. Neither his bona fides.
nor his reporting reliability has been established.
DATE OF INFORMATION:
1972-76
DATE OF INTERVIEW: 26-28 April 1977
Most of this information was obtained from Anatoliy
Aleksandrovich AKSENOV, a senior lieutenant of the KGB, and
other friends and classmates of Source who are at present KGB
and militia officers. AKSENOV was at that time in charge of
the KGB unit in the Yubileynaya Hotel, Minsk.
2.
In each tourist hotel in Minsk there is a so-called
militia punkt (unit). It is usually in a room on the first floor
of the hotel somewhere off the lobby. Supposedly this is a
militia unit whose purpose is to protect foreigners, maintain
order in the hotel, and prevent black-marketing. Actually, this
unit is manned by KGB representatives in militia uniforms who
carry militia as well as KGB identification. The militia seems
to be the favorite cover for the KGB.
3. In the Yubileynaya Hotel this unit always had four or
five persons on duty. During the day it had two privates and
a sergeant in uniform and two officers in civilian attire. At
night, when on duty, all of them usually wore militia uniforms.
Aside from the above-mentioned militia functions, their actual
mission was to prevent what they considered to be unnecessary
contact of Soviet citizens with foreigners, to observe any
suspicious actions by either, and to ensure that only approved:
persons. had access to the hotel. All other Soviet citizens
would be stopped, their documents checked, and their business
questioned. An officer from such a unit once stopped Source
after he had spent the night with a Bulgarian girl in the hotel.
Source thinks he was discovered through audio surveillance.
CONFIDENTIAL

This officer showed his militia identification, and asked for
and checked Source's documentation by telephone.
Source without making any report, because Source, by veiled
references to AKSENCY, managed to make this officer believe
The was AKSENOV's agent. Later Source learned that this officer was
AKSENOV'S KGB subordinate..
4 The KGB also has an audio surveillance room and possibly
Source
several saferooms in the hotel. Once in 1975, after drinking
with Source for several hours in a restaurant, AKSENOV invited
him to come to the "special place" in the Yubileynaya Hotel.
Source thinks that AKSENOV probably telephoned before going to the
Yubileynaya. Source was led through a number of corridors to
a room in the back of the hotel which AKSENOV unlocked with a
key. There was no one in the room, although AKSENOV later told
Source that there are supposed to be two people on duty at all
times. AKSENOV and Source continued drinking in the room.
Source did not pay too much attention to details, but at one
point, apparently in order to impress Source with KGB capabilities.
AKSENOV showed the Source a tape recorder, which was of foreign
or Baltic republic make, and let him listen through the earphones
to what was being recorded from a room under surveillance.
claimed that he could hear all the sounds in the room, that of
running water, etc. AKSENOV switched from room to room; audio
quality was uniformly good. AKSENOV later explained that this is
the audio surveillance room (komnata proslushivaniya) and that
the KGB is capable of listening in to any room in the hotel.
Alog using notations in code (according to Source's best recol-
lection) is kept indicating the time periods of listening in on
each room, and the conversations actually recorded. Source
was unable to recall whether there was more than one tape récorder
in the room or how one recorded segment was distinguished from
another on the tapes. He presumed that it was done by voice
