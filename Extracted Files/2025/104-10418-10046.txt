WERE DATED JUL 75, ONE HAVING BEEN SIGNED BY OLTMANS AND THE
OTHER TWO BY DEWI SUKARNO, OLTMANS' LETTER WAS AN EXPRESSION
OF INTEREST IN THE SENATE INVESTIGATIONS AND PARTICULARLY IN ANY
OLTMANS CLAIMED TO HAVE KNOWN SUKARNO
e.
ASPECT REGARDING INDONESIA.
QUITE WELL, AND SAID THAT HE HAD HAD SEVERAL DISCUSSIONS WITH SUKARNO
ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE CIA AND HOW THE CIA WAS
TRYING TO OUST SUKARNG.
DEWI SUKARNO'S TWO LETTERS WERE REQUESTS
FOR INFORMATION ON THE RESULTS OF THE SENATE INVESTIGATION AND
HOPED THAT THE INQUIRIES WOULD SERVE TO CLEAR HER HUSBAND'S NAME.
3.
SINCE THE LETTERS WERE ACTUALLY WRITTEN TO SENATOR FRANK
CHURCH AS HEAD OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE,
FOUND IT
INTERESTING THAT AGEE WOULD BE ABLE TO OBTAIN COPIES OF LETTERS.
WRITTEN TO A U.S. SENATOR IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS HEAD OF SUCH
WONDERED IF SOMEONE ON THE SENATE COMMITTEE HAD
A COMMITTEE.
이
JAGUAR
이
JAGUAR
SENT THE LETTERS TO AGEE, BUT WE FEEL IT POSSIBLE THAT OLTMANS/
SUKARNO GAVE COPIES OF THEIR LETTERS TO PEOPLE IN PARIS WHO GOT
THEM TO AGEE.
