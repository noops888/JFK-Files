DDO STAFF MEETING BRIEF #32
22 February 1978
1. DDCI
The DDCI attended this week's staff meeting. He spoke
of his appreciation of being able to work directly with
the Operations Directorate, an organization which he has
known from the field. He said that when he was first
offered the nomination of the post of Deputy Director,
he thought of the Agency primarily in terms of his
perceptions of this Directorate. He knew that its officers
worked long hours, developed excellent contacts and produced
top-flight reports working always with a strong sense of
dedication. He is planning to have a series of briefings
which will further acquaint him with the activities of the
Directorate. Meanwhile he reaffirmed that he had an open
door to persons who had problems or issues that they wished
to bring directly to his attention.
On his first day on duty, Mr. Carlucci was thrown in
direct confrontation with the Department over the State/
CIA Treaty. While the Department has expressed very strong
emotion concerning this Treaty, the Deputy Director stands
by the position that he expressed during his confirmation
hearings. When asked by one Senator about the State/CIA
relations, he said that he felt this relationship had been
codified to the extent that this was possible and that it
was now a matter for Ambassadors and Chiefs of Station to
work out their own individual arrangements. He hopes that
we will be able to find some way of diffusing this issue so
that we may proceed to other more substantive issues such as
internal reporting responsibilities, communications, and
cover.
Specific cover problems were briefly discussed. The
DDO promised to deliver to the DDCI a new inventory of
those issues and situations where the Divisions are

encountering problems that they or the DDO had been unable
to resolve with the Department. The DDCI agreed to take a
look at this catalog of cover problems and asked that a
special paper on cover problems in Africa be forwarded to
him.
Mr. Carlucci spoke of the interest Congress has in
imposing Hughes/Ryan type procedures on sensitive intelligence
operations as well as covert action. He had pointed out two
problem areas to the Senate Committee, i.e., the difficulty
of defining what is a sensitive operation and the problems
involved in providing sufficient background and detail to
permit the SSCI to make informed judgments on individual
operations.
2.
Responses to Dr. Brzezinski's Letter
While Dr. Brzezinski has not replied to the letter sent
earlier to him this month proposing the 32 key countries on
which we would prepare new political reporting plans, we
are working on the presumption that this list is acceptable
to him. It is planned that we will include sensitive
operational details in a separate annex, The plan will be
coordinated with NFAC and the Department and then forwarded
with the annex to Dr. Brzezinski.
3. Memoranda Addressed to DCI and DDCI
:
Memoranda addressed to the DCI and DDCI concerning their
appointments with Ambassadors and Chiefs of Station should
be in their offices at least three days prior to the
scheduled appointment.
4. Reorganization of the Operations Directorate
The DDO presented his tentative plan for the reorganization
of the Operations Directorate which he will discuss with the
Director within a week.
