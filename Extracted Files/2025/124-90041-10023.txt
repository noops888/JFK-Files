with his local supporters through three women who visit him periodically. He
has been apprised of the activities of his followers in Miami and has requested
that $20,000 be furnished to a 40-man group of his followers in Camaguey
Province. The Camaguey group is the one he has charged with making a raid on
La Cabaña prison and freeing him.
6. Under the orders of Reinaldo BLANCO Navarro, ons PRUNA Blanco (fnu)) has
contacted one Narciso NAVARRO who has a group of followers in Pinar del
Rio and has arms, ammunition, and dynamite buried on his farm in that province.
PRUNA Blanco Iso has a group of followers in Pinar del Prio province which
is led by Jesus CABRERA and former sergeant MARTINEZ (mu) (3) The CABRERA (5)
group is called Legion Democrática Cubana (LDC, Cuban Democratic Legion)。

9. On about 25 August 1959 Manuel BLANCO Navarro, in Miami, wrote a letter to one of
his followers in Cuba. Enclosed with the letter were two messages which BLANCO
asked be forwarded to Orlando VELAZCO, Distribuidora de Refrescos ARENALYS
HNO SA, Avenida No. 515 y 517, Cardenas, Matanzas, telephone 63275 BLANCO also
asked that CELAZCO be informed that the letters were "from his sister (Haydee" (S)
(Sic). One of the messages reads as follows:
Dear Brother:
I am writing these lines to accompany a letter from my friend
Dr. Rodriguez Couceiro 9 in whose house I am staying since I found
out that they have arrested Leonel and that I cannot return there.
As you will see in the letter, I am sending you a series of instruc-
tions to see if we can maintain the group that is presently without
any leaders. Just as you have probably read in the newspapers, they
have caught all the leaders in the roundup. This doesn't mean any-
thing more than that we shall be delayed until we are reorganized
again. Only about 100 were arrested, and the group mmbered about
3,000.
As he (my friend) informs you, I do not believe that you ought
to visit Reinaldo BLANCO Navarro in La Cabaña prison. You should
send someone in whom you have confidence. In the new contacts that you
made do not use your own name. Use an alias so that, if anyone
should talk, they will not be able to identify you. You should pro-
tect the place where you live. When you have meetings, hold them at
prearranged places, never in your home. I know that you know how to
do these things, but I want to warn you to be careful and use other
persons to make your contacts. Don't do-it personally. The principal
objective is to is able to maintain yourself as the leader of the
movement st least until you select chiefs if your work prevents you
from leading in Habana.
الونية
We have made contact here with a large group which was not caught
and which is also organized from Autentico people. This group did not
lose its leaders, since, as I say, it was not caught because it had
joined us only a few days previously. This group is almost ready for
action; so it is urgent that you reorganize our people rapidly in order

that Don Fidel may not last until the New Year. In the next letter we
shall send more details and possibly give the main outlines of the
business. As soon as you have anything to report, use a courier in
whom you have confidence. Do not use the name of Carlos LOSADA ince
that name is now "burned". Use the name (Angel MARTINEZ and use the
address which you already have for the time being. I think that we
shall soon change residence, but I will send you the new address as
soon as we do.
When you reply, use the name "little grandmother" (abuelita)
since as you know,
mame" is also "burned". Many regards to all
and an embrace from your sister

Dear Friend:

Miami 21 August 1959
:
As I suppose you already/know, because of the treason of William
Morgan 12 and Eloy GUTIERREZ Me Mencyol2, the leaders of the Organization
have been arrested, and it is most necessary that our people be
reorganized so that the movement is not lost. The only person who is
able to do so is you. I know that the responsibility is very great,
but I also know your abilities, and we are sure that you will be able
to do the job.
As a first objective, it is necessary to establish
contact with
Captain Reinaldo BLANCO Navarro. He is the chief of our organization
and will continue to be. He is in prison in La Cabaña, according to
our information, but is allowed to receive visitors. He knows you,...
since you met each other in his office. You can introduce yourself as
Ad the brother of HaydeeHe will give you names of persons and instruc-
tions to follow. However, it is very important that, while be remains
a prisoner, you set up a courier so that you don't have to make sub-
sequent visits. This would be dangerous in the extreme.
With respect to the rebels, be very careful in making your contacts,
since one lesson is enough. There is one safe person whom you can trust,
Chim on behalf and
the
r. Fran MARSHALL. He is secretary of the Union Union Club Club You can see

dinner on the terrace of the Union Club Tell him that it rained a lot.
Find out from him if Lt. PEÑA Aca can or cannot be trusted, since our
information is contradictory. Be very careful with the rebels, and don't
make the contacts with them directly. It is better that you designate
another person for the purpose. Franlis trustworthy but very easygoing.
Fran's trustworthy be
Another group you can contact is that of (Jorge GUTIERREZ Izaguirre (5)
in the Rosita de Hornedo. Tell him that you were sent by Francisco
GONZALEZ, who is in Montclair, New Jersey; that here we are united;
and that he-should-join his group to our movement. I I shall send you
more information on this group
You should also see Dr. Valentin ARENAS Amiga, His office is
at Aguiar No. 556, Habana. Tell him that you come on my behalf and
to recall the last visit of myself and the "Mejicanosto his office
in which we were speaking of CASTRO. I recently wrote him a letter
from New York, He leads a group of followers of Jose Ignacio RASCO 5)

So that he doesn't mistrust you, tell him that you are the messenger
(enviado) and tell him to recall the interview we had in the lobby
of the Savoy Hilton of New York. Up to recently he had a group.
For financial matters you can see Señor BELTS BELT a friend of
Haydee, and Señor Alin SUERO Falla(3) To contact the latter, see
secretary Senor Jorge MACHADO and tell him that you come on my
behalf and that of the word Sugar (sic.) It is very important
that you get together a good finance committee to handle the money
problem there. Also talk to (BLANCO) about persons you can see about
money. Another person that you can see is Julio LOBO
(Julio LOBO'S) (S) with Dr. BELT LTIS)
You should also see (Alejandro VERGARA 2 dro VERGARA The chancellor of the
