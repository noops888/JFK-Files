Technical Information
Reference:
DAMA 31767 dated 11 April 1967
1. LIONION 1 photographic results continue to be satisfactory
for all concerned. It is therefore advisable that no changes in
proceduro be made at this time.
2. It is apparent that LIONION I releyed the incorrect devel-
oping formula for the pulso camera fils. Perhaps this error is due to
bis inactivity in processing such film for over a year. Since the
conception of this operation all pulse camera film has been developed
in Microdol X. On the other hand, Tri X film used in the LIONION 2
operation (Pentax camera and, Balscope) has traditionally been devel-
oped in Acufine.
3. All pulse camera film is processed at leadquarters by an
automatic Huston system. Time and temperature information which the
lab uses would be of little value to your development procedure.
results of your recent test indicate that it should be satisfactory
for an occasional check on the equipment.
The
4. The difference between Plus X Negative and Plus X Faa fila
is worth only one half "f" stop, which should cause no problem if you
decide to use the latter.

Availability of the Nikon Television System
1. At the time of Hugh T. FRANCOTTE's departure from Head-
quarters, KURIOT had recently beyun an extensive evaluation of
the Nikon closed circuit television system. If this particular
system is now considered "operational", FRANCOTTE wishes to be
so advised, as there may he a possible application for it in.
support of an operation at the Mexico City Station. Lawrence F.
BARKER was recently briefed by FRANCOTTE on the Nikon system,
and is now interested in obtaining additional facts concerning it.
BARKER, who is responsible for the LIONION Project, foresees a
possibility for its use in the LIONION photographic basehouse..
2.
:
It was thought that perhaps the system could be further
"operationally tested" at this baschouse, and at the same time,
the Station could examine the possibility of a permanent Instal-
lation. Presently, LIONION/1 is utilizing a Balscope and Pentax
camera for obtaining photographic coverage of the entrance to the
PBRUMEN Embassy. Provided the television camera could be equipped
with a telephoto lens of about the same focal length as the
combination of the Balscope and 20X eyeplece, this system might
be a suitable substitute for the equipment now In service.
3.
It is requested that the Mexico City Station be advised
If the Nikon television system is available, and Headquarters
thoughts concerning the testing of It at the LIONION basehouse.

1. Attached (USC) are the expired genuine PBRUMEN
passports of LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 together with two photo-
graphs and five signature specimens of each agent.
2. It is requested that new PBRUMEN passports be
prepared by KURIOT and pouched to the Station as soon as
possible.
3. The assumption of reference B that passports
obtained at the PBRUMEN Embassy in Mexico City are actually
issued in the PBRUMEN Capitol City is correct.
4. The old passports should be returned to the Station
as the Mexican inimigration visas appearing of pages 11 and 19 of
the LIONION and LIONION-2 passports, respectively, must be
in the possession of the Subjects until they are granted their final
immigration documents.
