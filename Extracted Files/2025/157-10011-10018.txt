after I had left the Agency, which was in February 1962.

Senator Mondale. Now, you say you discussed probably

with Bundy and Rostow the capability in developing more
capability of assassinations.
And you may have discussed

it in the context of various potential targets without
deciding on them. Once you decided on a target, or you were
going to recommend a target, what was the process of getting
clearance?
Mr. Bissell. I can't answer you that, simply because
no specific target was ever recommended.
And to the best

of my knowledge and belief, other than the case we have discussed
at length of Castro, which in time preceded the SRRIFLE pro-
ject.
I
15
can speculate on how that would have worked if you wish.
Senator Mondale. No.

18
The Chairman. Let's go ahead then with the questions.
Mr. Schwarz. Senator Baker asked, did Helms succeed you?
Mr. Bissell. That is correct.
19
Mr. Schwarz.
20
21
Did you turn over SRRIFLE to him and
did you tell him about it?
Mr. Bissell. I believe I did. And I also believe
22
that Mr. Harvey told him about it promptly after the turnover.
23
24
Mr. Schwarz. Do you know a man called Justin O'Donnell?
Mr. Bissell. Yes, I do.

Mr. Schwarz. Did you ask him in words or substance to

6
Mr. Bissell. I asked him to investigate the possibility
and to make explanation for so doing.
Mr. Schwarz. When did you do that?
Mr. Bissell. I don't remember the date of that. I may
7
have it on a chronology here, but I imagine that is a matter
8
9
of record, or that he has testified to that date. I don't
remember the date.
10
Mr.Schwarz.
Did you tell him this connection with
11
12
13
making plans to go see the passer of the poison, Mr. Gottlieb?
Mr. Bissell. I think I probably did.
Mr. Schwarz. Did he tell you he wouldn't do it?
Mr. Bissell.
14
Later he told me that he didn't want to
15
16
do it. But he also said that he thought it was an inappro-
priate action, and that the desired object could be accom-
plished better in other ways.
17
18
Mr. Schwarz. Who authorized you to tell Mr. @Donnell
19
to take steps to move toward assassinating Mr. Lumumba?
Mr. Bissell. Nobody.
20
21
Mr. Schwarz. Did you inform the White House of that?
Mr. Bissell. No.
22
Mr. Schwarz. To the best of your knowledge, did anybody
23
inform the White House of that?
24
25
Mr. Bissell. To the best of my knowledge, no.

1
Mr. Schwarz. Why did you seek to assassinate Mr.
2
Lumumba?
3
4
5
6
Mr. Bissell. I didn't seek to assassinate him. I
told a member of the clandestine service to make plans and
develop the capability so to do if it were approved and
ordered.
7
Senator Goldwater.
Approved by who?
Mr. Bissell.
8
It would have then had to have approval
9
at the highest level of government.
10
The Chairman. Where did the idea come from?
11
Mr. Bissell. I don't remember, Mr. Chairman.
It could
12
possibly have been mine.
13
The Chairman. It could possibly have been yours?
14
Mr. Schwarz. Did you tell Rostow that was your initiative?
Mr. Bissell. I told him that the instruction as to
15
O'Donnell was my initiative.
16
17
Senator Baker. How many others did you plan on, just
as a contingency?
18
How many other people did you instruct to draw up plans
19
to assassinate?
20
Mr. Bissell. I don't believe there were any others which
21
went to the point of instructing that a man be prepared.
22
Senator Baker. How many were there that didn't go that
23
far?
How many murders did you contemplate?
24
Mr. Bissell.
Well, Senator

quoting a cable concerning the asset WIROGUE, who was sent
to the Congo in the fall of 1960.
The Chairman. Mr. Bissell, the memorandum to which
counsel has referred reads as follows:
"In recommending the agent or asset ROGUE, the Chief
Hof Station, Leopoldville, the Chief of the Agency's African
Division, probably Bronson Tweedy, wrote in late 1960:
8

10
11

13
14
'He is indeed aware of the precepts of right and wrong,
but if he is given an assignment, which may be morally wrong
in the eyes of the world, but necessary because his case offi-
cer ordered him to carry it out, then it is right, and he
will dutifully undertake appropriate action for its execution
without pangs of conscience. In a word, he can rationalize
all actions'".
15
16
17
Is that fairly representative of the philosophy that
applied to such matters at the time?
Mr. Bissell. Well, it certainly applied within the
18
range of matters that would have come under SRRIFLE.
19
20
21
22
Could I say, Mr. Chairman, that I know of no way in
which it is possible to operate a secret intelligence agency
or a secret service unless it has at least a number of
employees who are willing to and can be depended upon to
23
carry out orders involving acts of this sort.
24
The Chairman.
That assumes, of course, that the
25
United States ought to assassinate foreign leaders.

2

5
Mr. Bissell. It was not meant to suggest that it was
entirely comparable, but the individual whom I have mentioned
were all perceived in their time and place as menaces to
their own countries and the U.S. interests.
6
Senator Goldwater.
Might I ask a question based on his
7
experience?
8
9
10
11
12
From my readings in trying to learn more about intelli-
gence, I gathered the impression that the actions such as
you have been describing up to and including assassination,
are practiced by every intelligence organization that I have
been studying, is that correct?
13
Senator Goldwater.
14
15
Mr.Bissell. That is my impression likewise, Senator.
Including England?
Mr. Bissell. I believe so. In fact, I think definitely
16
it has been used by M16. I couldn't give you specific
cases.
17
Senator Goldwater.
Certainly KGB.
18
Mr. Bissell. Certainly the KGB
although as, the Chair-
19
man pointed out the other day, I at least cannot point to
20
any case where the KGB has carried out the assassination of
21
a chief of state.
22
Senator Goldwater. Would you assume that in the cases
23
24
of those other countries that this ruler would have knowledge
of this in every case?

Mr.Bissell. In the case specifically of the U.K.,

I would answer in the affirmative. I also believe, however,
that the Chief of the Intelligence Service of any one of those
countries would flatly deny that the chief of state had
knowledge of such action.
6
Senator Goldwater. Thank you.
7
Senator Baker. Would you deny it?

Mr. Bissell. In our case here?:

19
Senator Baker. Yes, sir.
Mr. Bissell. Yes, it would be appropriate to do so.
Senator Baker. Have you done so?
Mr. Bissell. I have not had occasion to, because I am
unaware of any high level assassination that occurred by
the U.S.
Senator Baker. Doesn't that amount to a denial?
Mr. Bissell. It is a denial that any has occurred,
at least in the period that I am aware of.
Mr. Schwarz. Was your answer to Senator Baker meant to
indicate that you would perjure yourself on this matter?
Mr. Bissell.
It depends a little bit on the context.
20
21
22
There are occasions when I would go a long way to protect the
President of the United States from certain kinds of embarrass-
ment.
23
24

Senator Baker. The question was, very simply, would
you try to protect the President in such a case as you des-

Mr.Bissell. I can conceive of so doing, Senator.
Senator Tower. May I pursue that just a moment further?
You might say one thing in sworn testimony before a
committee like this, but say another thing publicly, is that
what you mean?
Mr. Bissell. That is exactly what I mean.
7
8
The Chairman. Have you lied to this committee?
9
Mr. Bissell. No, sir.
10
The Chairman. Would you lie to this committee?
11
Mr. Bissell. No, sir.
12
Senator Tower. I think that distinction has to be made.
13
I think I would have lied about the U-2 myself.
The Chairman.
14
Shall we proceed with the questions?
Mr. Schwarz.
15
The remaining topic I have is Trujillo.
16
17
18
19
It is respectfully indicated, and involves a lot of documents.
And we have some procedural matters that we need to take up.
I know we can't finish Trujillo before 12:30, and I would
suggest that we ask the witness and whatever Senators that
can return to come back this afternoon on Trujillo.
20
The Chairman. We have a Senate order that there will
21
be no further committee meetings this afternoon.
22
I doubt that we can obtain unanimous consent.

what would be an assassination were it not for the legal
significance of the term.
Mr. Bissell. I don't think I remember any cases in
which that sort of matter was discussed or was the subject
of planning, other than the ones which have already been
mentioned in testimony.

But of course that contemplates what we have seen in

the earlier testimony, that when you begin an operation

to in some way incompacitate him politically, that it often
moves to the extreme of incapacitating him physically, isn't
that true?

apply.
Mr. Schwarz will commence the questioning.
It will be understood that the oath still continues to
Mr. Schwarz. Before we turn to Trujillo, two quick
questions. On the subject of Sukarno, were, you involved in
the making of the movie in which an actor was made up to look
like Sukarno, and he engaged in sexual activity, with the
proposal, the plan, being that that movie would be released
in Indonesia?
Mr. Bissell. I have no recollection of that.
Mr. Schwarz. And if I took out any of the details and
broke it apart you would have no recollection?
Mr. Bissell. I am afraid not.
Mr. Schwarz. And the second thing, to pin down on Mr.
Helms, did you brief him about the Mafia matter?
19
Mr. Bissell. I am reasonably clear that I did not brief
20
21
him in the early stages, that is to say, in 1960. And my
impression is that he may very well not have been briefed on it
22
until I was about to leave the Agency in early 1962.
23
Mr. Schwarz. But at that point you did brief him??
24
Mr. Bissell. I don't remember whether I personally
25

they might eventually be so used.
Mr. Schwarz. Is that a supposition, or is it based upon
3
any recollection?
4
Mr. Bissell. I would say it is a faint recollection.
5
But I find it very difficult in this case to distinguish
6
between an element of supposition and a dim recollection.
7
8
9
10
11
Let me come to what I seem to remember about this matter.
There was, as you have already indicated, several discussions
in the Special Group, and one or more at least in other very
small groups with representation from State, the White House
and the Agency. And I am clear
I do recollect that the
--
12
13
14
15
16
plans at that time contemplated the arming of obviously a
relatively small group inside the Dominican Republic, that is,
the provision of arms perhaps for a dozen or so people, but
not for something like a Bay of Pigs invasion or a major
geurilla activity.
17
18
19
Now, in discussing that kind of an operation, I am
perfectly certain that everyone that participated in the
discussion was clear that weapons so supplied might very well
be used against Trujillo or other senior supporters of his.
20
21
22
Mr. Schwarz. For how many countries in your experience
at the CIA has the US Government supplied arms to dissident
groups within the country?
23
24
Mr. Bissell. Well, we have talked about two cases;
Indonesia is another case during the time I was in the Agency,
25
TOP SECRET
NW 50955 DocId: 32203786 Page 11
TOP SECRET
90

2
or before I was DDP. Off hand I can't remember other cases,
but there may have been some. Well, earlier before I was ever
3
in the Agency, there was the case of Iran. And there was the
4
reasonably well publicized case of Guatamala.
5
6
Mr. Schwarz. And the Iron Curtain countries?
Mr. Bissell. I think we have.
7
Mr. Schwarz.
But what I am driving at, it is fairly
8
common to supply arms to dissident elements in countries all
over the world?
9
10
Mr. Bissell. Yes, that is correct.
11
12
Mr. Schwarz. Does taht also imply that there is an
assassination contemplated or not?
13
Mr. Bissell. I would say definitely not, in most cases
not.
14
In a large scale operation like Guatamala there was
15
no intention of any assassination. I think you would include
it under that term.
16
The same is true in Iran of course the possibility
17
that a chief of state would be killed.
18
The Chairman. But you would distinguish this matter from
19
just supplying of arms to dissidents?
In other words, there
20
was an element of knowledge here that the arms were supplied
21
22
23
for a purpose, and that that purpose might well be the assassi
nation of Trujillo or other highly placed people in this
Government, correct?
24
25
Mr. Bissell. The way I would prefer to state it, Senator,
TOP SECRET

91
1

3

I think is basically consistent with what you said. I would
say that in the planning of this operation, and in the approval
process, those involved would probably have given a higher
probability to such use being made of the weapons than they
would in some of the other operations that I have referred to.

;
Mr. Schwarz. However, just focusing on the Special
Group as of the 12th of January, you can't tell from the
minutes which state of mind existed, but you have a faint
recollection that the more targeted state of mind existed as of
the 12th of January?
Mr. Bissell. My impression is that as of that time, as
I mentioned at the end of the testimony this morning, the
reason that the State Department, and probably the Agency's
representatives in the Special Group, favored this group was
a pragmatic reason. It was to maintain and strengthen political
ties with the dissidents.
Mr. Schwarz. The next matter of record that we should
focus on is a memorandum of January 25, 1961, apparently
reflecting a discussion of Project EMDEED. Was REMDEED the
code for the overthrow of Trujillo?
Mr. Bissell. I suspect it was the code name for the
project of support to the dissidents.
22
Mr. Schwarz. Do you remember the name EMSLEW?
23
I show you the memorandum of January 24, 1961 headed
24
"Discussion of Project_EMDEED."
Does it appear to be a

and this record, which is a record we have obtained from
the Agency, may be unfair to you.
But do you not agree
3
that on this record it appears that on the item of the pass-
4
5
6
ing of the weapons which were the weapons that were in fact
used, it appears that the AGency elected to keep the State
Department uninformed on that item?
7
8
Mr. Bissell. No, sir, it does not quite appear that way.
It appears
if I put these two together
9
Mr. Schwarz. By these two you mean your cable of March
10
11
24 and the cable of May 1 relating to certain matters is
not to be discussed with the State Department?
12
Mr. Bissell. Yes. The earlier cable of those refers to
13
machine guns.
14
15
16
Mr. Schwarz. And to the pouching of revolvers?
Mr. Bissell. And the pouching of revolvers. And
I believe that what eventually passed to the dissidents
17
were three rifles, not the revolvers. And, therefore, neither
18
19
of these cables in fact refers to the passage to the dissi-
dents out of UK's control.
20
This cable states the conditional willingness at some
21
time in the future to pass machine guns.
That permission
22
was never granted and they were never passed.
23
It refers to pouching revolvers. And I don't
24
know whether there was a record that those were ever passed,
25
or even intended to be passed, to the dissidents. And it would
