RECORD SERIES : STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS
AGENCY FILE NUMBER :
December 8, 1995
Status of Document:
Postponed in Part
Number of releases of previously postponed information: 6
Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors
including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the
absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.
Number of Postponements: 4
Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.
Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could
reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of
privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Chief Researcher
Ms. Barbara L. Mosley

씨
Please be advised that Ms. Barbara Mosley,
resume attached, has been interviewed by Gerald
Hamilton, Jackie Hess and myself for the position
as secretary/typist assigned to the MLK Research
Task Force.
Ms. Mosley certainly qualifies for this posi-
tion, and we all agree that she is the mature indi-
vidual for whom we are searching to fill this spot.
She has been employed on Capitol Hill for some time
and surely knows the many ins-and-outs.
I strongly recommend that Ms. Mosley be hired
at $12,000 per annum and report for duty on Tuesday,
June 21, 1977.
Tom, I certainly appreciate your consideration
on this matter. Thank you.
