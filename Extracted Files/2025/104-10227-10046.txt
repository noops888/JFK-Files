1. An AP source, Aureliano NUÑEZ Garcia, reported on 12 December 1961
that he had that day, by chance, met Dr. Aureliano SANCHEZ, a former delegate of
Dr. Aureliano SANCHEZ at the New Orleans Airport.
2. NUÑEZ stated that SANCHEZ said that he was returning that day from a
trip to Panama and Guatemala. In Panama he had talked to President CHIARI
and had found him to be judiciously, that is, to the contrary, when he had talked
to President ARBENZ in Guatemala he had found him extremely much closer to have
CASTRO's mentality. SANCHEZ had asked CHIARI about his visit to Cuba,
and then CHIARI expressed his opinion, YULES said it was logical because
CHIARI was extremely cowardly.
3. According to NUÑEZ, SANCHEZ further said that a short time ago
he had been called by Mr. Bob Hurwitch, Chief of the Cuban Desk in the
State Department, and that Hurwitch had told him not to fool around with
SANCHEZ or Julio Galicano, the man who had the support of the U.S.
was ANTI-CASTRO, and that as he, Hurwitch, had knowledge of the great work done
by SANCHEZ, he did not want him to continue losing more time.
4. NUÑEZ added that a few days later he received a phone call from
A-1. A-1 told NUÑEZ that he would help him because it was requested, but he
would never have done so by his own wish.
5. NUÑEZ added that SANCHEZ continued his travel on the destination, where
he resides at 1419 - 27th Street, N.W., Washington D.C.
