Dear Mr. Blake's

Marelius.

As the records will show I retired in the spring of
1971 after 40 years of Federal service 27 of which
were with the Agency and predecessor organizations.
At the time of my retirement a small ceremony was
held, presided over by Mr. Tom K., and I was shown
various items attesting to my length of service,
dedication to duty, etc. However, I was not per-
mitted to take these items with me due to certain
cover considerations which I admit have never been
quite clear to me. I was told informally in the
division that perhaps after a year the items would
be forwarded to me. It will soon be three years
and I have not yet received them.
I am sure I don't need to tell you how much these
items mean to me and what they will mean to my sons
in later years. Therefore I would appréciate hearing
from you as to the status of these items. I am sure
there are many other fellows in the same boat.
Anxiously awaiting your reply, I am

Dear Tom -
I am taking advantage of Gene's coming
visit to washington to send you this little
note.
We will be moving to the San Diesco area
the end of this month and hoped to be settled
into our new home there by the time mid-
September rolls around.
Tom, you will recall that at the time of
my retirement you presented me with a letter
from Dick, a certificate of service, and (I
understood) a silver medallion. All of these
items were then returned to be safely stored
avay until some future date - not specified.
I am sure you can appreciate that these itens
mean an awful lot to to me - and eventually will
mean a lot to my two sons. I realize and
appreciate the need, because of cover reasons,
for discretion with respect to displaying these
items to friends, etc. At the same time I
realize that as the years pass the chances of
these items getting "lost" or falling between
the chairs back home is very good. I do not
want to lose them and it goes without saying
that I would honor any restrictions that might
be imposed in the event they are sent to me.
The outfit in past years has entrusted me with
top secrets, with the management of unvouchered
funds, with details of sensitive operations.
Surely it can now trust me to use intelligent
discretion in the safeguarding of these items.
I write about. I would appreciate it Tom if
you would take this request into careful con
sideration.

When I saw you last in Washington you
promised one day you would be making a trip out
to San Diego. I am holding you to that and
hope it will be soon.
Lillian joins me in sending you our warmest
regards. Don't forget wherever I am you
and the outfit have a sincere friend who is pre-
pared to help out to the best of his ability.
