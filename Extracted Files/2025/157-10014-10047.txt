TESTIMONY OF ROBERT G. HALLEY
ACCOMPANIED BY JOHN RIGALL AND SEYMOUR R. BOLTEN
Mr. Halley. My name is Robert G. Halley.
Mr. Johnston. And I understand that is an alias and your
true identity will be preserved by the Agency.
Mr. Halley. That is correct.
Mr. Johnston. Mr. Bolten, would you state your full name?
Mr. Bolten. Seymour Bolten, Seymour R. Bolten.
Mr. Johnston. And John, the alias you are testifying
under?
Mr. Rigall. John Rigall, R-I-G-A-L-L.
Mr. Johnston. And Mr. Bolten and Mr. Rigall, would you
state your capacity in this session today?
Mr. Bolten. I am chief of the Review Staff of the CIA,
and responsible for dealings with the Senate Select Committee.
Mr. Rigall. I am Special Assistant to the DDO, sitting
in here as an alternate monitor.
Mr. Johnston. And the discussion that has taken place
prior to going on the record today basically has resulted in a
decision to have Mr. Bolten and Mr. Rigall attend as monitors,
and do you understand that, Mr. Halley?
Mr. Halley. Yes, I do.
Mr. Johnston. Mr. Halley, what was your capacity in the
Agency in November, 1963?
Mr. Halley. In November, 1963, I was the chief of Sta-
TOP SECRET
of the CIA operation that was based in Miami, Florida, targeted
as its primarily responsibility for the Cuban operation.
Mr. Johnston. Mr. Wallach has reminded me to remind you of
a procedural matter which, you understand you have the right
to counsel.
Mr. Halley. Yes, I do.
Mr. Johnston. And you understand you have a right not to
answer questions if you don't wish to, or not to answer questions
until you consult with Counsel, is that correct?
Mr. Halley. That is correct.
Mr. Johnston. And you are appearing here voluntarily
without counsel.
Mr. Halley. That is correct.
Mr. Johnston. And going back to substantive questions,
how long did you remain as Chief of Station?
What were the dates of your service?
Mr. Halley. Well, I arrived, or became involved in the
Cuban operations in the early 1962, and I stayed there until
approximately June of 1965.
Senator Schweiker. What about again in '62?
Mr. Halley. Early '62. I didn't give you the month,
Senator, because I originally came down to Florida to conduct
a survey of this operation to see what possibilities could
be carried out. In terms of the collection of intelligence.
Later I filed a report on it, and I was later assigned down there.
TOP SECRET
Senator Schweiker. And this was called JMWAVE, was it?
Mr. Halley. That is the cryptonym that the Agency used
for the Miami station.
Senator Schweiker. And to whom in that chain of command
at the CIA did you report when you were the operating head?
Mr. Halley. There were different people at different
times. When I first went to Miami, the task force commander was
Mr. William Harvey. He reported then to the DDP, who reported
to the Director of Central Intelligence. At a later point in
the operation, Mr. Harvey moved on to other tasks, and Mr.
Fitzgerald became the chief of that particular unit, and then,
after Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Hart was the head of that
particular unit.
And between Harvey and Fitzgerald, I think there was a
short period of time when a fellow by the name of Bruce Gee-
was the acting chief of that particular unit, or the chief.
I have forgotten the exact arrangement there.
Senator Schweiker. Sometime during this period did it
change its title from Task Force W to SAS, is that correct?
Or not correct, or do I have them mixed up?
Mr. Halley. My recollection of that chronology was that
it was first called SAS and then became Task Force W, and then
it was integrated back into DDI Division, which was the Western
Hemisphere Division.
Senator Schweiker. SAS preceded Task Force W?
TOP SECRET
Mr. Halley. Yes. That's off the top of my head. That's
my recollection of it.
Mr. Johnston. Just for the record, I think it was the
other way around. Task Force W was first and SAS was second.
Senator Schweiker. But in sum and substance your duties
were basically the same, whether it was Task Force W or SAS,
under Harvey and Fitzgerald, was that not so?
Mr. Halley. Well, I think you have to break this
up into two phases, Senator. The early phase, 1962, was
focused on coming up with an appraisal of what kind of an
operation could be run against Cuba in the context which existed
after the Bay of Pigs, post-mortems had been conducted. The Ad-
ministration at the time decided that they wanted to take another
look at the Cuban intelligence and national security problem.
Therefore, an assessment was to be made in the early period of time as to
what kind of an operation could be run in pursuit of U.S.
policy objectives, which was to see if Fidel Castro's
government could be removed. And when that assessment was
conducted as to what kind of intelligence operations could be
conducted, what kind of paramilitary or other operations could
be run, that was an initial phase, and that phase was ap-
proved and put into effect, but as that operation was being put into
effect the missile crisis came upon us, so that that was
brought to its logical conclusion because the operation
then shifted.
Senator Schweiker. After October of '62?
Mr. Halley. No, prior to October of '62, because the
Cuban crisis was in October of '62, but the buildup preceded
it, and our operations which were collecting intelligence in
Cuba detected this buildup as it was unfolding. Therefore,
the national priority became now how do you take action against
Fidel Castro, but what is the nature of this Soviet buildup.
And therefore the operation changed.
Then after the Cuban missile crisis of October of 1962,
the problem became one of monitoring the Soviet disengagement
from Cuba, and then there was another phase after that when
the Soviets were out, Castro was clearly recognized as the
established power in Cuba, and the problem became one of
looking at Cuba in the context of was there some other way to
get a political change in Cuba other than by military action
or by paramilitary action. In other words, the emphasis
shifted to looking at the Castro military establishment to
see if a coup could be pulled from within, to see if eco-
nomic pressures could be put on the Castro regime.
So the tasking of this particular unit did change, and
change of nuances and degrees during this period, but in a
professional sense it was the Cuban targets. So in
that sense you are correct, but it did go through various
changes as events changed.
Senator Schweiker. What was the relationship of your
station and your assignment to General Lansdale? What role
did he play?
Mr. Halley. Well, in the early days, in the early period
of 1962, General Lansdale was a member of a group that was
looking at the basic problem of what could be done against the
Cuban activity. This came up in one of my previous conversations
with Mr. Baron.
Senator Schweiker. Are you talking about something we
call Operation MONGOOSE, are we talking about Special Group
Augmented, or what are we talking about?
Mr. Halley. Well, when I first came into this activity
in 1962, the principal people that seemed to be involved with
it at that time were Robert Kennedy, General Lansdale, Dick
Helms, and William Harvey, and the group of Kennedy, Lansdale
and Helms were providing, if you will, the guidance and the
direction as to where this thing should go in the early days.
Shortly after the operation was established and I was
in Miami, Lansdale seems to have faded out of this particular
picture, and I was not involved in the Washington nuances or
this, so I am not clear as to exactly what was the reason for
his departure from this particular scene.
Senator Schweiker. And was that -- do you remember the
cryptonym, Operation MONGOOSE?
Mr. Halley. I've heard the cryptonym Operation MONGOOSE,
but that didn't impact on my life at that particular time.
Senator Schweiker. All right.
Mr. Johnston. Moving to the time of the Kennedy
assassination, were you Chief of Station and in Miami when
the President was assassinated?
Mr. Halley. Yes, I was the Chief of Station and I was
in Miami.
Mr. Johnston. You were physically in Miami on November
22nd?
Mr. Halley. Yes, I was.
Mr. Johnston. Did you receive any orders through CIA
channels to conduct an investigation in any fashion into the
assassination of the President?
Mr. Halley. Well, my recollection of that was that we
had requested name traces at the time that Oswald was
arrested, and that was our contribution to the investigation.
Mr. Johnston. Did you receive any order in the form of
a cable or any other fashion to conduct an investigation?
Mr. Halley. I don't recall receiving one, but if you
showed me a cable, I would have to comment on it. In other
words, this was in 1963. This is 1976, and as you know from
the record, I've been in an awful lot of high volume projects
since then, and I don't claim it is likely that I would recall
a specific cable, you know, on a particular day. I mean, I
have been in Berlin, Laos, Vietnam. My life has been active, so
therefore I do not recall a specific cable. If you've got a
cable, I'd be glad to comment on it.
Mr. Johnston. Well, I don't have one, and I'm asking you
whether one would exist.
Mr. Halley. I don't recall one.
Mr. Johnston. And your judgment would be that there was
not a cable ordering an investigation.
Mr. Halley. I can't say that. I can only say that I
don't recall one, but I do recall that at a later point, once
Oswald was detained by the police and there was some investi-
gative material emanating from that, we participated in
name trace activity of whatever was sent to us at that time
from Washington, because I do recall that at the time that
the name traces were conducted, that one of the Cuban groups
that we were in touch with at DRE, they did come up with a
tape of a debate which had taken place between Oswald and some
member of the DRE in New Orleans, and you know, that sort of
sticks in my mind as an event of that particular time. And I
commented on it, and as I recall, forwarded the tapes to
Washington.
Senator Schweiker. That was Bringuier's group, was it
not?
Mr. Halley. That was the DRE, the Direccion Revolucionaria.
Senator Schweiker. Wasn't Carlos Bringuier, maybe
I'm pronouncing it wrong, involved in that, and wasn't he
associated with you folks at that time?
Mr. Halley. Well, I don't recall that specific name,
Senator, at this time.
He did have a relationship with the DRE. We did deal
with a number of their top leaders.
Mr. Johnston. Let me come back to that later.
Did you receive any orders not to investigate, or
not to conduct an investigation of any kind?
Mr. Halley. No, I don't recall receiving any such orders.
Mr. Johnston. At this time period, November 22nd,
November 23rd, 1963, what was your capability in regard to
conducting an investigation among Cuban exiles, and with Cuban
sources?
Mr. Halley. Well, in relationship to Cubans living in
the United States, I would say that our capability was quite
good.
Now, if you are referring to our capability to conduct
an investigation in Cuba, I would have to say it was limited. I
have to know where specifically you are referring to. In
other words, if you're talking in the
Mr. Johnston. Principally domestically of Cuban
exiles in the United States, and your answer is --
Mr. Halley. That it would have been quite good.
Mr. Johnston. Secondly, with regard to collecting
intelligence as to possible Cuban involvement --
TOP SECRET
Mr. Halley. Yes. That's off the top of my head. That's
my recollection of it.
Mr. Johnston. Just for the record, I think it was the
other way around. Task Force W was first and SAS was second.
Senator Schweiker. But in sum and substance your duties
