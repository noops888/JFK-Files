Let us proceed to review a set of documents which were not
available to us in your first examination.
The attempt here
today is not to go over a lot of old ground that we covered
in your first examination but to focus our concerns on a

main events in the alleged story of an assassination plot
against Lumumba, and to refresh your recollection by review of
17
these documents.
Let me introduce as Exhibit 1 a cable from Allen Dulles
to the Leopoldville Station, marked for Robert Guthman on
October 26th, 1960.

Mr. Baron. We discussed this cable in your previous
appearance, did we not?
Mr. Tweedy. August 26th.

May I correct the date? It is August 26th.

Mr. Baron.
Certainly.

Mr. Baron.
After you took another look at this cable

you were concerned at the time.
14
Is that your impression now?

Mr. Tweedy. Yes.

I.
Let me just add to that a bit.
The cable per se I did not

When I first talked to Mr. Bissell about this, he certainly

implied the only reason the subject was being raised is because
it had been of national policy level concern. I do not think
it could be more clear-cut than that. This was basically, this
was the formal expression of that by the Director himself.

I cannot remember which came first, did I see this cable
first, or did I talk to Mr. Bissell first. I suspect that I

This marely confirmed what I think I probably heard from

Mr. Baron. In this discussion with Mr. Bissell, you are

Mr. Tweedy. I think it probably came up in the sense that
the thrust of the American position was that there was no
solution in the Congo without the fall from power of Mr. Lumumba,
constitu-
and no measure should be overlooked to achiave this
tional, revolutionary and indeed, executive action, if you want
to call it that.
Mr. Baron.. Meaning assassination?
Mr. Twaady. Yes.
But none of these possible measures wers excluded, and the
main point was that everybody agreed that Lumumba had to go or
We ware in for very serious trouble in the Congo.
Mr. Baron. You were referring a moment ago in discussing
this cable from Allen Dulles to the fact that when you first

May I comment just generally on those cables as a group?
There are no surprises in them as far as I am concerned, in
terms of detail. Much of it, even to this day, I still do not
remember.
One aspect emerges very clearly for me, that we were ver
careful about examining this on the possibilities of doing
anything against Lumumba. Rasically, this whole period was a

(Discussion off the record.)
Mr. Baron. Back on the record on this subject.
Mr. Tweedy. No, I do not have any further recollection of
6 detailed discussions with Bissell on this. On the other hand,
7
it was perfectly clear that he remained actively interested in
٤ it. I am sure that he was the one that had the idea of Justin
O'Donnell, for example, I think he undoubtedly came up with
1:

that idea. As you recall, I had forgotten entirely that Justin
O'Donnell had ever played a role in this. I am sure when he
fixed on O'Donnell the possibility to assist the Chief of Statice

Mr. Baron. Do you have any recollection of what Bissell
said to you in the series of discussions on the prospect of
assassinating Lumumba about the level at which the exploration
of this prospect had beer. authorized?
Mr. Tweedy. No. That is the aspect I was never clear on
excopt that it was perfectly clear to me that he was quite
confide..t that this was I am now talking about the elimination
of Lumumba by whatever means. I am not talking necessarily
about assassination: I want to be quite clear on that.

Washington were agreed that Lumumba must go. I cannot go any

I cannot say, for example, that Bissell

8
Mr. Baron.
Your comment about the fact that the authority
9
would have flowed from Mr. Bissell directy is borne out, is it
10
not, by Mr. Bissell's initials on this cable?
1:
Mr. Tweedy.
Yes, exactly.
1:
Mr. Baron.
Was that a fairly unusual practice, to have
13
14
both the DDP and the Chief of the Africa Division sign a
cable?
15-4
16
Mr. Tweedy. Quite common. Throughout the organization
on matters of either particular sensitivity or so important that
1';
2
27
the DDP wished to be constantly informed about correspondence
on a subject, the Chief of the Division would originate and
send out cables and have it actually signed off by the DDP.
That was quite a common practice in the Agency.
Mr. Baron. Do you have a recollection, having seen this
document, of the fact that you set up a special channel using
the YOPROP sensitivity indicator?
I did not recall YOPROP, but I recall special

Mr. Twaady. Certainly if he wanted, absolutely.
11
Mr. Baron.
Why was a special communications channel set
12
up in this cable?
17
Mr. Tweedy.
Because of the sensitivity of the subject..
14
This, again, was a frequent procedure in the Agency on sensitive
1, matters. If one was about to mount a sensitive operation, one
10
of the first things normaliy done was to set up special

communications procedures so the dissemination of the messages
could be restricted to what was required.
Mr. Baron. In this case, the especially sensitive subject to
which you were restricting communications access was the elimi-
nation of Lumumba by one means or another?

that Sidney Gottlieb would have discussed with the Chief of

his inventory, whatever it might be, and the two presumably were
6 trying to come to some conclusions as to what might have the
7
bast chance or the most practical chance of being used.
8:
This is my assumption.
I think in this early stage, that
would have been the purpose of the exercise.
Mr. Baron. Let me represent to you the testimony of Sidney
1: Gottl Gottlieb about two conversations that he had at Headquarters
E before he undertook the mission to the Congo in September of
17
1960.
14
15
First, when Dr. Gottlieby looked at this cable and some
subsequent cables which we will discuss today, he said these
16
cables applied to himself. He confirmed the fact that he took
::
:
:
:
a trip to the Congo and arrived on Sentember 26th as is indicated
by a subsequent cable, and left on October 5th, as is indicated
by another cable.
Dr. Gortlieb said before he left the Conce
before he left for the Congo
sorry,
he had & Conversation with you
and Glen Fields in which you instructed him to take a lathel
material to the Congo and give it to the Chief of Station
:
with instructions to assassinate Lumumba if it were possible
:
and to instruct the Chief of Station in the technical means by

which this lethal material could be administered through
2
Lumumba's food or toothpaste or something that he would ingest.
Mr. Gottliebjalso testified that in that conversation you
indicated to him that these instructions were being given at
Richard Bissell's authority.
Did that conversation take place?
(Discussion off the record.)
Mr. Tweedy. His testimony does not basically refresh my
memory.
The only aspect of it which I would find unrealistic is
that he had an instruction from me to tell the Chief of Station
10

to use this material and go ahead and assassinate Lumumba, as

matter, and that was never a matter, to the best of my recollec-

Mr. Bissell never said, look, you have the picture, go ahead

to me or anybody else, nor is the tenor of this correspondence

Mr. Baron. Do you recall if Mr. Bissell ever want. as
as telling you that if an opportunity arose to carry off the
assassination of Lumumba in a situation where it would be
practically impossible to confirm, that there was authority

the Chief of Station would be under those circumstances,
authorized to proceed to assassinate Lumumba?

meeting with (Dr. Gottlieb into component parts.
You agree now, having heard Dr. Gottlieb's, testimony, that
it is true that you had asked (Dr. Gottliebi to go to the Congo?
Mr. Tweady. Indeed, as I assumad I had, yes.
Mr. Baron.
It is also true that you knew that Dr. Gottlie

Mr. Tweedy. If he says so, I do not disagree with him.
I do not frankly recall thet at this point, but I am perfectly
wadded to accept what he says.
Mr. Baron. Assuming, for the moment, that you would have
required the Chief of Station to check back with Headquarters
before he carried out an assassination mission, would it be
true that you assigned Dr. Gottligh the task of instructing
the Chief of Station to assassinete Lumumba on that basis?
Dr. Gottlieb was the head of the Technical

It is perfectly obvious that the Agency felt that it had
2
the support of the. Executive in efforts to eliminate Lumumba.
It was at least my impression throughout this whole period that
4
if it ever came down to the point where somebody said, I think
5
we can do it, and we decided upon the means, that someone would
6
7
have said, well, before we do, obviously there has to be final
approval.
I would not have known where the final approval
8
9
would have come from. I would not expect that my corresporidence
with the Chief of Station in Leopoldville would result in the
