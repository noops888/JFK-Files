MEMORANDUM FOR: Federal Bureau of Investigation
SUBJECT: Person: Paul Cill

Telephone No.
1 August 1961
1. Reference is made to our memorandum of 11 July 1961,
captioned as above and also to our letter dated 1 July 1961
addressed to the Director, National Security Agency, with copy to the
Deputy Director, Central Intelligence Agency, captioned
"MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION CONCERNING".
2. The following information supplements the material on
Nicolas Georges DAMASCOU aka DAMASKOU or DAMASCUS
DAMASCUS reported in paragraph 2 of our 11 July 1961 memorandum.
Our representatives in Melbourne advised that Australian
Security Service indices reflect that Nicolas Georges DAMASCOU aka
DAMASCO arrived in Sydney, Australia on 6 October 1960 aboard the
SS. STRATNAVER, traveling from Greece. He was
in Alexandria, Egypt on 8 March 1960. He arrived in Sydney,
Australia on 6 October 1960 aboard the SS. STRATNAVER, traveling
from Greece. He was in Alexandria, Egypt on 8 March 1960. At the
time of his arrival in Sydney, DAMASCOU was in possession of an
Australian Visa No. 1376, issued in Cairo on 18 July 1960. He was
described as follows: height 5 feet 10 inches tall, normal build,
brown eyes, black hair, occupation "writer". He departed Australia
on 28 May 1961 aboard the SS. CRENSAY, destination not indicated
and as of 18 July 1961 had not re-entered Australia.
Our representatives in Mexico City meanwhile had
learned that Anastasia Georges DAMASCOU aka DAMASCUS, sister of
the above, on 8 July 1960 applied at the Mexican Consulate in
350 Antonio, Tamaulipas, for a Tourist Card to enter Mexico to visit
her brother Nicolas George DAMASCOU, then residing at the Hotel
SECRET
New York Office of
Free form in Mexico City, at the time of her visit, but for an entry
permit, she required a co-signing guarantor. The Mexican
Government approved her entry visa application but for the deposit
of a $1000 Peso bond, as a guarantee of her intention to depart
Mexico upon expiration of her tourist card and duration. Files contain
no record of her actual arrival in Mexico, missing
approval of her 8 July 1960 application. The most recent correspondence
on this case is contained in Mexico City files in early 1961,
selecting that Anastasia DAMASCO again requested a Tourist Card
on or about the date of the letter, at which time her address in the
United States was given as c/o Mexican Coast Bar, Astralo, Texas.
In reply to her second application as an entry permit,
the authorities replied with a request that she post a bond to insure
$10,000 Pesos, to guarantee departure from Mexico upon expiration of
her tourist visa. There is no further information currently available
on her further travel plans.
With reference to Nicolas Georges DAMASCOU, on basis
of the information reported in preceding paragraphs, a check by our
representatives with officials of the United States Embassy in Mexico
City revealed that Nicolas Georges DAMASCOU, born 18 March 1931 in
Alexandria, Egypt, holder of Greek Passport 1961 issued in
Alexandria, Egypt on 8 March 1961 and valid to 10 April 1961, with
address of 6 Elizabeth King Road, Elizabeth Bay, Sydney, Australia
was the recipient of a United States Visa on 29 October 1960. On his
application, DAMASCOU indicated that he desired to visit the United
States for a period of four months, described as a pleasure trip to visit
his sister. The visa application did not include any destination address
in the United States. It is also noted that the visa card maintained on
Nicolas DAMASCOU in the Embassy in Mexico City contains a notation
by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, Los Angeles,
May 29, 1961.
Through a reliable confidential source our representatives
in Egypt had learned in the interim that Nicolas DAMASCOU, who
is identical with the individual described in preceding paragraphs,
currently resides in Los Angeles, California, at 1100 North Gardner,
Apartment 11, and that he advised his mother and younger brother,
still residing in Alexandria, that he plans to marry the daughter of an
American official, who is not further identified. The same source
also advised that Georges DAMASCOU aka DAMASKOU, father of
Nicolas and Anastasia DAMASCOU aka DAMASCUS, died during the
course of 1960. Following the demise of the father, Angelika
SECRET
DAMASCOU, to accompany a younger son not identified by name, had
planned to emigrate from Egypt to join her son Nicolas in the United
States. However, prior to the finalization of these plans, Angelika
DAMASCOU refused a statement of details concerning which are not
clear, but she is reported as of this writing still to be paralyzed and
obviously too weak to travel. No further information was available on
the possible future emigration plans of Angelika DAMASCOU aka
GAVOURAS and/or of her unidentified younger brother of Nicolas
DAMASCOU and of Anastasia DAMASCOU.
On basis of the reported filing of an application for a
United States Visa in July 1960 at the U.S. Embassy in London by
Anastasia DAMASCOU, our representatives in London were requested
to initiate checks of British Home Indices in the names of Nicolas
DAMASCOU and of Anastasia DAMASCOU. It is advised that as of
late July 1961, they hold no traces on Nicolas George DAMASCOU aka
DAMASCO aka DAMASCUS but that although they had no traces on
Anastasia DAMASCOU, they are continuing to check her possible
residence in London during 1960, based on the reported visa
application data. It is believed that they hold no traces on either
Nicolas George DAMASCOU aka DAMASCO aka DAMASCUS or on
his sister Anastasia George DAMASCOU.
It is suggested that the indices of the Department of State's
Visa Section as well as the indices of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, Department of Justice, may contain further detailed
information on the current immigration status, whereabouts in the
United States, and also the residence in the United States of Nicolas
Georges DAMASCOU aka DAMASCUS or Anastasia Georges DAMASCOU
aka DAMASCO, and any other members of the family who may have
applied for entry visas from abroad.
With regard to Juett GILBRA Casarne, mentioned in above
referenced memorandum of 17 July 1961, in contact of Nicolas
DAMASCOU aka DAMASCUS, it is suggested that the indices of the
Department of State may contain additional information on his activities
during his service as the Mexican Embassy in Washington, D.C.
