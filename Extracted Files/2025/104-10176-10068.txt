23. Approximately in July 1964 I had a second interview with "Nordic"
in the presence of "Jim" and "Enrique."
24. At the special request of the "friends," in September and October
1964 we sent forward reports on the officers of the Revolutionary Armed
Forces in the six provinces, including any background data and informa-
tion we had on them. Afterwards, the work of making Summaries of Infor-
mation was intensified.
25. During August-September-October 1964 picket lines were formed in
front of the airline companies that had flights to Mexico, and in front
of airports, Mexican tourist agencies, and Mexican Consulates as a pro-
test against the Mexican Government and its policy with relation to Cuba.
This was done in Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Miami, New York and other places
in the United States. This was done daily in Miami and New York. On
different occasions pickets were placed in front of theaters which were
showing Mexican films. In October pickets were placed in Miami and Miami
Beach and propaganda was handed out at the time of the holding of the
ASTA (Thirty-fourth World Congress of Travel Agencies).
26. In November 1964 we began to pass information to the "friends" about
the training camps which were being opened in New Jersey to prepare and
train people for the invasion of Haiti. We infiltrated some of our people
into this group and thus kept informed of everything that went on.
27. At the end of 1964 and up to April 1965 we continued to make studies
Among them were those on the Cuban Telephone Enterprise, the Department
of Port and Coastal Vigilance, censorship of correspondence, Cuban national
budgets 1964/65, radio programs heard in Cuba.
28. At the request of the "friends" we collaborated in the reception ac-
tivities for Juanita CASTRO and obtained the great propaganda campaign, mobilizing
all the Masonic lodges so they would back the proposal of the Masons who
were supporting LOPEZ Mateos at the UN.
29. In December 1964 we organized a
30. We acted as a support mechanism to the "friends" in the matter con-
cerning Mrs. LIPPERT.
31. In the first months of 1965 an attempt was made on three different
occasions to carry out Rescue Operation No. 1.
32. During the first months of 1965 we kept informed about the situation
in the Dominican Republic and the participation of the Cubans and Domini-
cans in the Miami area in what was going on.
33. During this whole period, in view of the division existing among the
exiles and of the formation of so many new exile groups, we infiltrated
our agents into all the organizations and reported on all the movements
of leaders of these groups and their activities, on all their plans
and action plans. Our aim and purpose was to report everything about
the movements of the Cubans and the exile groups.
34. During this period we also began carding all our reports for the

SUBJECT: Meeting with Rolando Masferrer. MAR 27 1972
DOC. MICRO. SER.
MICROFILMED
1. In accordance with our conversation, I am sending you the
facts as I know them regarding the 7 August meeting in New York City
between Rolando Masferrer and Averell Clark.
2. Apparently Masferrer knows Stanley Ross, the Editor of El
Tiempo, a Spanish-language newspaper published in New York. The
office is at 78 Fifth Avenue and the telephone number is WA 4-2750.
Possibly Masferrer did not previously know Ross. But at any rate, either
on his own or through someone else, he got in touch with him in late July
or early August and said that he wanted to be put in touch with an American
with an aviation and military background. I do not know too much about
Ross at the moment except that he has had considerable Latin American
experience and would be a logical person for any Latino to approach. It
would be very easy to obtain additional evidence on him if desired.
3. I am attaching for your information a list of the stockholders
in El Tiempo, Inc, to provide some indication of who is behind Ross. In
addition, we have a list of all the senior officers of El Tiempo.
4. Ross knew of Clark through the Hitchcocks listed, as you will
note, as stockholders. Mrs. Margaret Hitchcock is Clark's aunt, while
Thomas Hitchcock III is his first cousin as presumably, is William
Hitchcock. During the war Clark was an outstanding fighter pilot, having
flown with the RAF through the roughest days of the Battle of Britain, and
thereafter shifted to the Americans with whom he flew many missions as
a P-47 pilot. He is still in the Air Force Reserve.
5. At Ross's request Clark met Masferrer at the El Tiempo office
in New York City on 7 August. Ross left the room so that the session was
only between Clark and Masferrer. As a pro-Batista Cuban, Masferrer
was known to us at the time of the Bay of Pigs. In fact, at one point just
before the invasion, the U.S. Department of Justice arrested him and put
him in jail in Florida for violation of the provisions of the Neutrality Act.

6. Masferrer alleged to Clark that he was representing some twenty
Cuban exile organizations, and that he was working with a Haitian, Charles
Forben, head of an anti-Duvalier organization known as "Capois La Mort."
Forben allegedly asked Masferrer to help his organization by leasing or
buying a PBY-5 aircraft for use against Duvalier. Masferrer claimed that
Forben's group was in a position to take control of the Ile de la Gonave;
an island just off the west coast of Haiti in the gulf north of Port au Prince.
It is conceivable that this is the wrong island since Clark did not have the
name of the island in question, but based on the description of its location
by Masferrer, I am assuming this to be the island involved. At any rate,
in return for help from Masferrer, Forben was to be asked to let Masferrer
and some of his Cuban exiles use the island in question as a base from which
to harass the eastern end of the Island of Cuba.
7. Clark told Masferrer that as a member of the Air Force Reserve,
he would have to report the conversation to the USG and could not do any-
thing without clearing with the USG. Masferrer said that he had no objection
to this, particularly with regard to the activities of Forben and his group,
but he asked that Clark not mention his intention to harass Cuba, since he
maintained that the USG would forbid this as being against USG policy. Clark
said that Masferrer would have to leave to him what matters he chose to
discuss with the USG. It was then agreed that Clark could reach Masferrer
through Ross's office for about a week, and thereafter could pass a message
to him through Ross.
8. Clark got in touch with me because I had known him during the
war; I had known his family for many years, and one of his closest friends,
James B. Watriss, is a cousin of mine and was, until about a year ago,
associated with the Agency. Incidentally, I believe that Clark has had some
discussions with SOD with the idea of possibly being used in connection with
special operations.

information in this report from an associate of Rolando
Masferrer Rojas.
1. On 20 August 1965 an associate of Rolando Arendio Masferrer
Rojas, former Cuban senator, said that Masferrer is in touch
with General Leon Cantave regarding a plot to invade Haiti
from the Dominican Republic. Masferrer is trying to recruit
unmarried Cubans in New York who are willing to go to the
Dominican Republic and eventually to live in Haiti. He does
not want Cubans who would want to return to the United States
because of family or for any other reason.
2. Masferrer asked Antonio Rojas Masferrer, his cousin, to manage
a farm in the Dominican Republic which will be used as a
training and staging area for about 100 men which Masferrer
will recruit. This group will be enlarged by men which Cantave
has in the Dominican Republic.
3. Cantave is negotiating with Dominicans to determine whether
the recruits from New York will travel to the Dominican
Republic with visas or whether they will enter the country
illegally.

Source for paras, 4 and 5: A member of a group of Cuban
emigres trained in the techniques of information collection.
The group has provided useful reports since 1961. This
information is from another Cuban emigre who is associated
with Homero Leon Fernandez.
4. On 9 August Homero Leon Fernandez said that Masferrer will
arrive in Miami in August to complete preparations for an
invasion of Haiti. He will bring 100 men from New York. In
Miami they will be joined by 100 men from Brigade 2506 and
100 men from Leon's group. The 300 men will leave for an
undetermined place from where they will invade Haiti.
5. According to Leon, Masferrer plans to use four boats and five
aircraft for the invasion of Haiti. The aircraft will be used
to bomb Santiago de Cuba, Oriente Province, Cuba, after Francois
Duvalier has been overthrown.
Field Comment: Leon, a Cuban emigre, is a leader of the
Fuerzas Armadas Constitucionales de Cuba en el Exilio (FACCE,
Constitutional Armed Forces of Cuba in Exile).

Former Latin American diplomat who maintains relationships with
officials of Latin American countries. Source is a trained
reporter and his information has been reliable in the past.
1. As of about 16 April 1965, Rolando Masferrer Rojas, a Cuban
exile leader, had been sending weapons to Miami, Florida, for
use by Haitian exiles in an attempt to overthrow Haitian
dictator Francois Duvalier. The arms were being stored in the
home of Aurea Esther Poggio Aragon, a Cuban woman whose last
known address was 148Tk. 8th Court, Hialeah, Florida. The
weapons were to be transported to an undisclosed destination
outside the United States.
2. In early April 1965, Poggio went to the Dominican Republic on
behalf of Masferrer regarding the Haitian exile scene. When
Poggio was out of Miami, the keys to her residence were left
with Antonio Rojas Masferrer.
1. Field Comment: The same source reported in CSDB-3/661,878,
dated 18 June 1964, that Masferrer had met with Poggio,
among others, on 29 May 1964 regarding an expected revolt
in Cuba.
