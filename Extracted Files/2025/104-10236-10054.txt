1. COS DOES NOT QUESTION POSSIBILITY COVERAGE CUBAN PROBLEM FROM
JAMAICA MIGHT BE EXTENDED BUT BELIEVES DELEGATION SUCH AS AMBUD WHOSE
PRESENCE OVERT WOULD PROVE COUNTER PRODUCTIVE. STATEMENT OF PRIME
MINISTER BUSTAMANTE 4 SEPTEMBER THAT GOVT WOULD NOT ALLOW JAMAICA BE
USED FOR COUNTER REVOLUTIONARY PURPOSE AGAINST CUBA MUST BE TAKEN
SERIOUSLY. REASON FOR THIS STATEMENT IS CONTINUING AND FREQUENTLY
REITERATED CONCERN OF JAMAICAN GOVT FOR SAFETY OF 25,2D JAMAICANS
RESIDENT IN CUBA.
2. STATION FEELS CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS MADE IN GAINING COVERT
SUPPORT THROUGH RUABBE FOR CI EFFORT AGAINST CUBANS WWHICH WAS EXTENDED
TO SOME ACTUAL ASSISTANCE FOR ANTI-CUBAN ACTION DURING CARIBBEAN GAMES.
WISH POINT OUT HOWEVER THIS CONTINGENT UPON MAINTENANCE COVERT NATURE
OF ACTIVITY. IN FACE DECLARED GOVT POSITION COS BELIEVES ANY EXPANSION
JAMAICA OF ACTIVITIES AGAINST CUBA MUST BE COVERT. FURTHER SINCE
