1.
This memorandum is furnished for information only.
2. Early in April 1968 the Office of the General Coun-
sel made available to Central Cover Staff (CCS) a copy of a
letter and an attached list of organizations sent to the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by Mr. Jon Frappier of Ram-
parts Magazine. The letter, dated 5 April 1968, had been
furnished OGC through InS liaison channels. The letter appended
a list of 145 tax-exempt organizations and indicated that all
were suspected of having been funded by or having cooperated
with CIA.
:
3. The letter indicated that the listed organizations
were only a part of the organizations being scrutinized by
Ramparts and that other available sources of information on
these and other suspect organizations had already been examined.
The other sources of information were stated as including the
literature of the organizations and interviews with their staff
members; records available in the Attorney General's offices
in Illinois, Massachusetts, and New York; data available at
the National Information Bureau in New York, Group Research,
Inc., in Washington, D.C., and the Foundation Library Centers
in New York and Washington; and the 990-A returns available at
the district offices of the IRS. The letter requested 990-A

returns for specified years and in most cases the Form 1023
Application for Tax Exempt Status. Ramparts asked the IRS
to make these materials available for inspection at a mutu-
ally convenient time.
:
4. A review of available CIA data on the listed organi-
zations has shown that 89 of them were at one time or another
somehow associated with CIA. Only two of these:
:
are of current operational interest. These two activities
and 45 organizations formerly of interest to CIA were men-
tioned in the American press during MHDOWEL.01 Forty-two
other listed organizations which were in fact associated
✓ with CIA were not exposed during (MHDOWEL.01 We have found no
evidence that 55 organizations on the list were ever directly
or indirectly associated with CIA. (Because two of the names
on the list are successive names for the same organization,
the actual total number of organizations listed is 144 rather
than 145.) Three additional project organizations, not
included in the Ramparts list, may be vulnerable because
they were covertly funded by hitherto unexposed foundation
funding instruments included in the list. Only one of these,
is of cur-
rent operational interest.
5. The CA Staff was furnished a copy of the Raaparts
letter and list and has checked out the organizations of
possible previous CA Staff interest. All organizations not
readily identifiable with known project organizations or as
CCS funding instruments have been traced with RID, with CS
area divisions that might logically have had an interest in
them and against CCS Registry files. Through arrangements
with the IRS, representatives of CCS and CGC also examined
available IRS data (990-A's and Forms 1023) on the listed
organizations. This was done before the IRS documents were
made available to Ramparts, in order to be sure that restricte
$90-A, Part I. data would not be furnished to Ramparts and to
try to establish the reasons for Ramparts' interest in the
organizations. Our current findings are the results of these
various file reviews.
:
6. Attached hereto are annexes listing and discussing
the several categories of organizations on the Ramparts list.
Annex A deals with the two organizations on the list which
are still of active operational interest. Both received

press mention during (NHDOWEL. Annex B lists and discusses
under several sub-categories the 42 organizations with which
the Agency has had some direct or indirect operational ties
in the past which were not cited in the press during
- 이
DOWEL. Annex C lists the 45 organizations included in the
April 1968 list which had former Agency operational ties
which were subject to press allegations during MHDOWEL.0/ Annex
D lists and briefly discusses the 55 organizations included
in the Ramparts list that had no known operational connection
with CIA. Annex E lists and discusses three hitherto unex-
posed operational activities that are not included in the
April 1968 Ramparts list but which are vulnerable because
they were covertly funded by hitherto unexposed funding instru-
ments included in the Ramparts list. Annex F shows a copy of
the full April 1968 Ramparts list.
7. The 42 former project organizations listed and des-
cribed at Annex B which have not previously been charged with
CIA association in American press comment fall into five
general categories:
a. Foundations and other organizations used as
witting funding conduits for covert subsidies to pro-
ject organizations and other operational activities.
Sixteen organizations fall into this category. Eleven
of them are multipurpose legitimate foundations. which
were recuited by CCS. Four were created or recruited
for exclusive use in funding one project each and one
was used for a one-time travel grant.
b. Witting legitimate foundations and organiza-
tions used exclusively to provide funding and status
cover for singleton agents. Six organizations were
used in this way and provided cover for seven agents
in various parts of the world. Some of these organi-
zations also provided one-time support for unwitting
individuals of operational interest.
:
c. Proprietary or subsidy project organizations.
There are six of these: Projects CAMANTILLA WUHUSTLER,
FOCLPROOF, ETNAMABLE, SGPANFISH, and AESTRIKER

Eleven unwitting organizations which received
grants from project organizations for operational or
cover reasons or which cooperated with project organi-
zations.
8. We cannot say with complete assurance that all 55
of the apparently innocent organizations on the Ramparts
list in fact never had any Agency ties. Our researches have
shown that RID indices are often incomplete. We have found
operational use data in CCS files on organizations with no
record in RID. The same is true in other cases where infor-
mation was available in CA Staff or area division files on
organizations which drew a blank in RID. It seems likely,
however, that any undetected operational interest in the
organizations was in the period of the early 1950's and of a
marginal nature.
::
9. In reviewing available information on the listed
organizations we attempted to determine whether there was a
logical external basis for Ramparts' interest in the organi-
zations or whether some form of internal Agency leak might
be involved. Our reviews and analysis show fairly conclu-
sively that Ramparts has been proceeding on the basis of
overtly available information, supplemented by interviews
with project personnel:
a. All but three of the 42 terminated but hither-
to unexposed project organizations and 24 of the 55 or-
ganizations which actually had no Agency ties are some-
how related to project organizations or funding instru-
ments previously exposed. Some of the organizations
made legitimate or covert grants to previously exposed
organizations, others received covert or legitimate
grants from previously exposed funding instruments or
from innocent foundations that had made legitimate
grants to exposed organizations, and still others had
officers who were associated with exposed CIA organi-
zations.
b. Thirty-one innocent organizations on the
Ramparts list and three of the hitherto unexposed
organizations of former interest to the Agency have
no such known ties to exposed Agency organizations.
In most of these cases, however, the names of the
organizations are similar to those of exposed organ-
izations or are of a nature that makes them suspect.

10. It seems likely that Ramparts' interest in a num-
ber of the 42 unexposed project organizations is based on
factors unrelated to the actual CIA dealings with them.
11. The Headquarters elements that are or were responsi-
ble for the projects and activities that could be implicated
by new Ramparts allegations have been notified of the fore-
going findings. No further action is required at this time.

A review of available CIA data on the listed organi-
zations has shown that 89 of them were at one time or another
somehow associated with CIA. Only two of these
for International Youth Affairs (CA/B3 Project QRTROW) and
African-American Labor Center, Inc. (CA/B4 Project QRSTUMP)
are of current operational interest. These two activities
and 45 organizations formerly of interest to CIA were men-
tioned in the American press during MHDOWELL. Forty-two
other listed organizations which were in fact associated

CA/B4 Project QRSTUMP. Irving Brown (T) continues as
29AALC Executive Director and uses this relationship as
10
status cover for operational travels in African and Eu-
rope. Although covert funding of AALC has been suspended, 29
2406 black-bag payments to Brown and by him to operational
contacts may be implicity attributed to AALC.29

Post article.

29
CA/B3 Project QRTROW. Under Katzenbach guidelines
and DDP decisions, IIYA was to be re-established abroad 29
as a condition for continuation of the project. Various
possibilities in Europe have been explored and vetoed.
Steps are currently being taken to relocate the activity
in Belgium. |

01
IIYA received limited press mention during MHDOWEL and
only in the context of its Free Europe Committee origins 29
and its former funding by the International Development 29
Foundation (terminated WH Project COALIBI) (88).
29.

IIYA is vulnerable because of its former funding by
the Colt (41) and Ronthelym (129) Foundations, as well 29,29
as by the Helena Rubinstein Foundation (not on the 5 April29
1968 list but of known interest to Ramparts) and by the
