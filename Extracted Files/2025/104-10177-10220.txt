MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: John K. McLean
SECRET
3 May 1972
1.On. 28 April the undersigned was introduced to Mr. John
McLean by Mr. Wallace Lampshire, a staff officer. The purpose:
of the meeting was to discuss Mr. McLean's connection with Mr.
Gordon Barton McLendon (201-79764) and Mr. McLendon's stated
desire to helphis government.
2. Mr. McLean is a former staff officer (DDI/OCI) who
resigned to enter the field of finance. He has been a banker,
a stock broker (Sade & Co.) and currently is Vice-President
and Treasurer of International Ventures, Inc., 888 17th Street
N.W., Washington 20006, as well as Vice-President of Riviere
& Berens Securities Corp., stockbrokers located at 1832 M St.,
N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036.
3. Mr. McLendon was born in Paris, Texas 8 June 1921
and now lives in Dallas. According to Who's Who in the South
and Southwest, Mr. McLendon is the owner of a number of radio
stations and is listed as the president of numerous companies
in radio, TV, and motion picture theatre fields. Mr. McLendon
is reputedly a multi-millionaire.
4. Mr. McLean and Mr. McLendon have maintained a friend-
ship since their years at Yale. Mr. McLean recently visited
Mr. McLendon at his ranch some thirty miles from Dallas. During
this visit Mr. McLendon expressed his fears of the future of the
dollar and said that he has moved millions of his dollars to.
Europe where the money has been put into Swiss and French francs,
plus German marks. Most of the money is apparently in savings
instruments of one kind or another plus a night club that Mr.
McLendon has bought in Stockholm. During these conversations,
dr. McLendon wondered if these foreign operations might not be
of interest to the Government (read CIA as Mr. McLendon was
an ONI officer during WW II and is aware of Mr. McLean's former
employment with the Agency.) Mr. McLendon mentioned his night
club as a possibility, as it is frequented by persons of many
countries, including the USSR.
SECRET

SECRET
5. M. McLean has business interests in Dallas and
said that he is willing to expiore this possibility with
Mr. McLendon if we provide guidance.
:
6. Mr. McLean himself perhaps offers more potential
- via International Ventures, Inc. Mr. McLean is seeking
venture capital opportunities abroad. For example, he
and a Mr. Lincoln Epworth in. New York City are working
with a Japanese named Ikvo Kasai who is President of
Nichimen Co. of Tokyo, a firm seeking to export to the
States. Mr. McLean was frank to say that International
Ventures is more a dream than a reality in terms of busi-
ness but the concern is making progress. Mr. McLean offered
to be of any assistance.
Comment: I have sent for Mr. McLean's file and upon its
receipt I will seek a PCSA.
