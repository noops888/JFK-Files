MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Technical Services Division
ATTENTION
SUBJECT
: Chief, TSD/AOB
: Request for TOY Replacement for Arnold F.
AREHART.
!
1. WIH Division requests your cooperation in providing a
TDY replacement for Arnold F. ARCHART as Case Officer and
technician for the IIENVOY tap center in Mexico City. AREPART
has requested three weeks hope leave, from 10 to 28 September,
to drive his older son to the States to enroll him in his
freshman year of college. ARFHART has kept his leave plans
to a minimum so that his TOY replacement will need to be on
loan from Headquarters for as short a time as possible.
2. The Division had offered to provide an operations
officer as a TDY replacement but Hexico City Station has re-
quested that a technician be sent instead since the burden of
AREHART's job is the maintenance of equipment along with the
WE Division sug-
protection of CIA's interests inside the LP.
gests that your release of Mr. Charles Deck for this assign-
nent would be ideal if he is available, as no overlap would
be required since he is already knowledgeable of this opera-
tion. The Station was also very pleased with the work done
by "r. Deck on his last TRY to Mexico.
3. Because of the critical role the LIFNVOY Project
plays in the Station's whole operational picture, and because
of the importance the smooth-functioning of the ! is to car
liaison with top-level Mexican officials, your assistance is
requested. If Mr. Deck is not available, any other suitable
candidate would be acceptable. Please inform Hr. Bustos,
W/1/Mexico, X-4506, -4507 of your decision, as we would like
to be able to inform Mexico as soon as possible as to whether
a TOY replacement will be available.

1. Referenced dispatch which reflected the Station's apprecia-

recent TPY in Mexico and requested his return TDY was brought to
the attention of the appropriate KURIOT officials.
2. Unfortunately, RUTSAY will not be available to replace
AREHART during the latter's home leave period in the fall of 1964, ----
and KURIOT has no one else they can release for a prolonged period
this fall. Since the leave probably will only be about two months,
leadquarters wonders whether a technician is absolutely required.
Dees the Station believe that an operations officer, with some

make the Station contacts, could fill in during this period?

1. Arnold F. AREHART asked that his TDY replacement
inquire at Headquarters regarding the status of his request
for equipment which the Station forwarded to Headquarters as
Requisition No. 359-19-64. Headquarters has shipped to
Corpus Christi the items he requested in connection with
the Revere (shipped 20 April), and the Heath and Allied items
were shipped on 7 May. The Ampex and B-10 items have not yet
been received at Headquarters from the supplier. Headquarters
will pouch all items from these that weight and size will
permit, the remainder will have to be shipped to Corpus
Christi. In view of the equipment listed in LGIS 6030,
18 May 1964, which is also awaiting pickup at Corpus Christi,
perhaps there will be a flight soon.
2. It is requested that the above information be
passed to AREHART.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, TSD/AOB
SUBJECT
: LIENVOY TDY Report
1. TDY support of the LIENVOY operation in Mexico
City was provided by this office during the period 23 April to
15 May 1964. The Staff Agent, ARNOLD F. AREHART who manages
this operation underwent surgery for a hernia on the 24th of April,
The undersigned assumed the responsibilities and performed the
duties associated with the LIENVOY operation during AREHART'S
convalescence. He was incapacitated for duty from 23 April until
12 May. His operation was successful and recovery was normal.
AREHART returned to work on 12 May in a weakened condition and
three days of overlap was allowed to provide assistance with
the more strenuous and tiresome chores.
2. The LIENVOY Installation was found to be in
excellent condition. The operating personnel were well disciplined
and their procedures were well organized. The daily work was
being accomplished in a business like and efficient manner.
AREHART has done a commendable job in establishing and main
taining this highly productive operation,
3. The equipment in this installation has been in use
fifteen hours a day for over four years. As the result of good
maintenance practices it is in good shape and functioning well.
The minor difficulties encountered during the shake down period
have been overcome and equipment maintenance and repair poве
no significant problem There was no loss of coverage on any
line during the three week TDY.
4. The following observations and recommendations are
included herein to improve KURIOT services to the Field and to
aquaint responsible officers with technical discrepancies.
A. Pertinent technical information is not being
communicated to AREHART.
-2-
B. The drying up of the ball point pens in the B-10,
Dial Recorder has been a constant nuisance since
the beginning of this operation. The pressure
sensitive tape was the obvious answer to this
problem, but the first ten rolls of pressure
tape were received after nearly four years of
struggling with the defective póns. It is
recommended that pressure sensitive tape bo
supplied to this operation for future use.
C. The ten rolls of pressure sensitive tape
received during this TDY were wound back-
wards on their spindles.
D. The tires on the idler wheel of the B-10 are
drying and cracking and fail to obtain adequate
traction on the flywheel. This causes tape
feed problems. It is recommended that three
dozen new idler wheels be pouched to AREHART
immediately. Several of the defective idler
wheels arco available in this office for
inspection.

C/S COMMENT: REQUESTED INFO RE CUBAN ARMS
DISCOVERED IN VENEZUELA BE BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION
OF LITENSOR.
REF DIR 88863
L.
1. COS CAN OF COURSE DELIVER REF INFORMATION DIRECTLY TO
LTENSOR. SUGGEST HOWEVER THAT SUCH CLANDESITNE PASSAGE DOES NOT
PLACE GOM IN POSITION WHERE POSITIVE COOPERATION OTHER OAS NATIONS,
STIMULATED.
2. CERTAINLY GOV REABLIZES MEXICAN POSTURE THIS MATTER EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT. WOULD NOT GOV THEN BE WILLING SEND MEMBER BETANCOURT'S
STAFF TO MEXI FOR PERSONAL MEETING LITENSOR TO PRESENT NEW
DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE, PERHAPS IMMEDIATUDY BEFORE INTERNATION
SURFACING? SAME VENEZUELAN REP COULD HOLD PRESS CONFERENCE AFTER
LITENSOR MEETING. THIS WOULD INSURE FULL PRESS COVERAGE, WITH
EDITORIAL FOLLOW-UP BY STATION ASSETS. PERHAPS GOM WOULD FEEL
FORCED TAKE MORE POSITIVE STAND BECAUSE OF FEAR LOCAL PUBLIC OPINION
REACTION.
3. SHOULD GOV REP HAVE DIFFICULTY OBTAINING INTERVIEW LITENSOR
COS MIGHT BE ABLE EXPEDITE.
4. IN ANY EVENT COS CAN DO SHOULD PARA TWO ACTION BE
UNFEASIBLE.
