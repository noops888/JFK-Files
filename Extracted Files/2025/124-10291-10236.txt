INSISTING THAT CASTRO'S OVERTHROW WAS TO BE ACHIEVED BY INTERNAL
RESISTANCE AND THIS HAD ALREADY STARTED.

BY ALL CLASSES OF THE POPULATION. IT HAD MEMBERS IN ALL 33
TRADE UNIONS, THE G-2, MILITIA AND THROUGHOUT THE ADMINISTRATION.
RAY ESTIMATED 80 PERCENT OF POPULATION WERE OPPOSED TO CASTRO,
THOUGH MAJORITY WERE NOT ACTIVELY SO, HE CONSIDERED THE MRP AT

3. THE MRP WAS PRESENTLY SHORT OF ARMS AND EXPLOSIVES BUT THE
POSITION WAS IMPROVING (A MILITIA CAPTAIN WAS RECENTLY
SENTENCED TO 30 YEARS IN PRISON FOR PASSING ARMS TO THE MRP).
NO HELP WHATSOEVER HAD BEEN RECEIVED BY THE INTERNAL RESISTANCE
FROM THE "SOURCES IN THE UNITED STATES, WHO PROVIDED SUPPORT
FOR THE INVASION". THESE SOURCES WERE STILL THINKING
INEFFECTUALLY IN TERMS OF A FURTHER INVASION.
4. THE GENERAL ATTITUDE OF THE RESISTANCE IN CUBA TOWARDS
THE EXILES WAS ONE OF INDIFFERENCE MOUNTING TO CONTEMPT FOR
SPECIFIC MOVES SUCH AS THE PROPOSED PROMOTION OF A CUBAN GOVT
IN EXILE. WHAT THE RESISTANCE WANTED WAS FUNDS AND THE RETURN,
BY INFILTRATION, OF TRAINED EXILES, PARTICULARLY COMMUNICATION
EXPERTS.
5. ON THE TIMING OF CASTRO'S OVERTHROW, RAY SAID CASTRO WOULD
NOT LAST ANOTHER YEAR. HE ADDED THAT THE SITUATION IN CUBA:
IMMEDIATELY AFTER CASTRO'S DOWNFALL, WOULD BE DANGEROUS AND COULD
DEVELOP INTO A CIVIL WAR.
