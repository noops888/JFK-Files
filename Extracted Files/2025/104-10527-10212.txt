RECENTLY CONCLUDED HOS REVIEW OF ZRPRIMA PROGRAM SEOUS
W
THAT KUBARI EFFORTS HAVE NOT ACHIEVED ANY SIGNIFICANT RESULTS AND
CONTINUATION OF PROGRAM AS SUCH NO LONGER WARRANTED MAIN REASON
2
FOR KUBARK FAILURE IS THAT CUBAN TECHNICIAN RECRUITING PROGRA
HAS BEEN HISERABLE FAILURE WHEN MEASURED AGAINST/ORIGINAL
OBJECTIVE OF 2000 TECHS FROM WESTERN EUROPE ALONE THOUGH OUR
FIGURES NOT COMPLETE, WE ESTIMATE PROBABLY LESS THAN FIFTY
CANDIDATES HAVE RECEIVED CONTRACT APPROVAL AND WE ABLE CONFIRH
ABOUT TEN WHO HAVE ACTUALLY MADE IT TO THE ISLAND
SUCCEEDED IN INSERTING INSERT ABOUT THIRTY RECRUITED C TE TECES
VARIOUS HIRING CHANNELS, BUT SO FAR ONLY THO HAVE RECEIVED CONTRACT
APPROVAL FROM HAVA
:

KUBARIK
2 CUBAN FAILURE TO RECRUIT IN SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS APPEARS
DUE LARGELY TO RELUCTANCE FOREIGN MINISTRY AND FOREIGN SERVICE
OFFICERS PURSUE TECH RECRUITING MISSION AGGRESSIVELY, LUREAUCRATIC
INCOMPETENCE IN HAVANA, FEAR OF INFILTRATION OF HOSTILE AGENTS

AND PROBABLE LOSS OF INTER ST IN THE PROGRAM ON PART OF CASTRO
HIMSELF. THESE FACTORS WHICH EMERGE FROM OUR STUDY OF THE CUBAN
PERFORMANCE ACCOUNT FOR LACK OF RESPONSE FROM EMBASSIES TO
APPLICATIONS, LABU DELAY IN GETTING CORD BACK FROM HAVANA AND
SMALL NUMBER OF TECHS ULTIMATELY HIRED. LONG TIME LAG BETWEEN
INITIAL APPLICATION AND ULTINATE APPRO
SIX TO HIME MONTHS, HAS COST, CUBANS NUBBER OF
INITIALLY EAGER BUT SUBSEQUENTLY LOST INTEREST OR TOOK OTHER
JOBS
3. IN FACE OF FOREGOING WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT WORTHWHILE
TO CONTINUE INTENSIVE SEARCH FOR ZRPRIMA CANDIDATES FOR INSERTION
WISH STRESS
INTO CUBAN HIRING CHANNEL. /STATIONS WITH ACTIVE LEADS SHOULD STAY
WITH THEM IN THE HOPE THEY MAY STILL BE HIRED, BUT CEASE EFFORTS
TO GENERATE LEADS FROM SCRATCH. ON OTHER HAND, THERE ARE FAIR
MUMBER NON BLOC TECHS IN CUBA AND IT LIKELY CUBANS WILL CONTINUE
TO RIVE NEEC ON LIMITED SELECTIVE BASIS AS THEY DID PRIOR
TO GRPRIMA PROGRAM. STATIONS THEREFORE ALE UDARD 10

IN THIS CONNECTION WE NOTE THAT MOST PERUMEN OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE
FOR RECRUITING TECHS TEND TO RELY HEAVILY ON LOCAL CP STAMP OF
APPROVAL OR OTHER STRONG INDICATION THAT CANDIDATE IS POLITICALLY
ACCEPTACLE LACKING THIS THEY MAY EITHER IGNORE THE APPLICATION
CEREJECT IT.
RESPONSE OF MOST STATIONS IN IMPLEMENTING ZRPRIMA HAS
BEEN HOST GRATIFYING. WE PROVIDED CUBANS WITH GOOD NUUBER HIGHLY
QUALIFIED ENGINEERS AND TECENICIANS WHICH THEY FOR REASONS CITED
2
UNABLE OR UNFILLING TO ACCEPT KUBARK HAS MADE A RESPECTABLE
KFFORT TO EXPLOIT THIS OPPORTUNITY AND FACT THAT WE HAVE NOT
ACHIEVED SIGNIFICANT RESULTS IS BARELT KAFLECTION CUBAN CONFUSION
AND INEPTITUDE WITH RESULTANT FAILURE ACHIEVE THEIR OWN GOALS
