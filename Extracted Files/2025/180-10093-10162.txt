MEMORANDUM

FROM: Jack Moriarty
PAM
RE: Peter Carroll Glynn, Jr.
DATE: April 25, 1977
001304
Pursuant to an earlier phone contact, I interviewed Mr.
Glynn on his job at 4301 Suitland Road, Suitland, Maryland
at 2:35 p.m. Friday, April 22, 1977. Subject is employed as
an Intelligence Analyst by NOSIC (Naval Oceanic Surveillance
Information Center) 763-2258 and resides at 107 Howard
Street, Dumfries, Virginia, 221-8748.
He was serving with the U.S. Army on 11-22-63 assigned
to Fort Walters, Mineral Wells, Texas as a radio technician
and as such regularly monitered messages between Mexico and
Cuba. As a result, he overheard comments in the sphere which
were adverse to the newly assassinated President and were
upsetting to him. Although he doesn't recall the exact
dialogue, the gist concerned the humor found by the Cubans
and Mexicans appraising this murder as being done by his own
people and yet suspecting foreigners like themselves.
Consequently, it has occurred to Glynn that we may
benefit by causing a thorough check to be made of the ASA
(Army Security Agency) who Glynn believes recorded all such
messages usually in tape form-and stored same. He also
prepared dossier of which he gave me the original and one
copy.
He goes on to say their mission at Fort Walters was
labeled a training mission and, as such, was comprehensive
enough to encompass the recording of all such collateral
messages. Additionally, he recalls the Mexican sending
station used the name of "Chihuahua."

COMMITTEE ADDITIONAL VALIDATION STEPS.
2. DURING SUBJECT INCIDENT I WAS STATIONED AT THE 330TH ASA COMPANY (A) OF THE

ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA AS TO WHAT THIS MISSION WAS, ITS DATA STORAGE LOCATION (IF ANY),
AND POSSIBLY DATA ANALYSIS EVALUATION RESULTS.

4. I MUST APOLOGIZE FOR BEING EXTREMELY VAGUE IN REFERENCE TO MY WORK WITH THE

MAY POSSIBLY BRANCH YOUR INVESTIGATION INTO NEW AND HOPEFULLY MORE RESOURCEFUL AREAS.
IF I CAN BE OF ANY ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME AT
ANY TIME AT HOME OR AT WORK. I PRAY TO THE LORD THIS INVESTIGATIVE COMMITTEE UNVEILS
