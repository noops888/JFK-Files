1. Being forwarded USC are copies of the QRPHONE/1 training
report, the JEMINIMUM evaluation, contact reports of meetings with
QRPHONE/1, a WOGEAR review of QRPHONE/1's book and some notes made
by the STFLIMFLAM Headquarters officer, Harvey B. DAITCHMAN (IDEN),
after his meetings with QRPHONE/1. These are for the information
of both LCPIPIT and London Station and, taken together, should give
you both the flavor of the variety of measures taken to assess the
operational potential of QRPHONE/1.
2. During PAUPEROS' TDY at Headquarters we discussed the
necessity of having QRPHONE/1 undergo an intensive seven day
STFLIMFLAN training program to be conducted by DAITCHMAN.
It is
our opinion that in order for this training to be of maximum
benefit, QRPHONE/1 and DAITCHMAN ought to be ensconced in a
safehouse facility which provides security, comfort and an
atmosphere conducive to learning. It is important that the
training be conducted in a locale which will allow QRPHONE to give
his full attention without being disturbed by his multitude of
business and social contacts. Therefore, we recommend that LCPIPIT
rent a cottage or beach house away from London for the duration of
the training cycle. In discussing this with QRPHONE, he readily
agreed and indicated that there would be no difficulty in getting
away from his family for as long as we thought necessary.

sisply would tell them and his business contacts that he was
traveling on the continent. Please advise us of the dates which
are determined to be convenient to PAUPEROS and QRPHONE/1.
Headquarters officer would prefer either the third or fourth
week of September, and certainly not before.
3. As indicated in the reference we solicit comments from
LCPIPIT and London Station on the results of our varied assessments
of QRPHONE/1 and our decision to move ahead in the new operational
directions described in OEPW-1661. We view the coming year as a
trial one for these purposes and the Project Renewal has been
submitted with that understanding clearly described.
4. Since QRPHONE/1 might refer to conversations he had with
Andrew F. TELQUIST (P), PAUPEROS should know that TELQUIST used
the alias "Bob" in all his meetings with QRPHONE/1.
