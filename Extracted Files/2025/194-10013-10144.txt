3. (U) MERLINO FIRST-MET WHITE ON 28 AUG-80, WHEN BOTH ARRIVED AT
KEMPER MILITARY SCHOOL & COLLEGE (KMSC), BOONVILLE, MISSOURI, AS
FRESHMEN (PLEBES), ASSIGNED TO DIFFERENT COMPANIES. MERLINO'S LAST
CONTACT WITH WHITE WAS ON ABOUT 26 SEP 81, TWO DAYS BEFORE WHITE
DROPPED OUT OF KMSC. THROUGHOUT ACADEMIC YEAR 80-81-AND DURING
SEP-81, MERLINO SAW WHITE DAILY, USUALLY AT FORMATIONS, OCCASIONALLY
IN CLASS, BUT MADE PERSONAL CONTACT ONLY ON ABOUT FIFTEEN OCCASIONS.
THEY ALSO MET BRIEFLY AT THE AIRBORNE SCHOOL, FT BENNING, GEORGIA, IN
JULY 1981. THEY WERE WELL ACQUAINTED, BUT WERE NOT CLOSE PERSONAL
FRIENDS.
4. (C) MERLINO DID NOT KNOW OF WHITE'S FAMILY BACKGROUND OR FINAN-
CIAL SITUATION, ALTHOUGH WHITE DID NOT APPEAR. TO HAVE ANY FINANCIAL
PROBLEMS. NOR DID_MERLINO KNOW IF WHITE USED NARCOTICS OR ABUSED
ALCOHOL. WHITE WAS PHYSICALLY HEALTHY AND FIT, BUT NOT ATHLETIC HE
DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE ANY_DEVIANT_SEXUAL TENDENCIES.OR..HANG-UPS, TO
INCLUDE HOMOSEXUALITY. WHITE WAS REPUTED TO BE A MORALLY STRAIGHT
INDIVIDUAL WHO VALUED HIS OWN HONESTY AND INTEGRITY. HE WAS EXCEPT-
IONALLY BRIGHT, AND CONSISTENTLY EARNED HIGH-GRADES IN ACADEMIC SUB-
JECTS AND MILITARY SCIENCE.
5. (C) WHITE WAS ALSO A VERY SERIOUS, EXTREMELY I SERIOUS, EXTREMELY INTENSE, AND HIGHLY
IDEALISTIC PERSON. HE WAS USUALLY MILD MANNERED, BUT WOULD GET
QUITE AGITATED DURING SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS IN PAPERS HE WROTE AND
DURING DISCUSSIONS IN HISTORY CLASS CHE EARNESTLY_DEFENDED_THE_MARX-
IST PHILOSOPHY OF EQUALITY. IN OTHER DISCUSSIONS HE REVEALED AN
ADMIRATION FOR HOW ADOLF HITLER HARNESSED THE ENERGIES AND NATIONAL-
ISM OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE. HOWEVER, WHITE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE PRO-
NAZI OR ANTI-SEMITIC. IN FACT, HE SEEMED TO BE SYMPATHETIC TO MIN-
ORITY GROUPS IN THE U.S., AND THEIR BID FOR EQUALITY.
6. (C) WHITE NEVER SHOWED_ANY DISLOYALTY, TO THE U.S.. ALTHOUGH DUR-
ING CONVERSATIONS HE WOULD CONSTRUCTIVELY CRITICIZE_AND_CRITIQUE

AS THOUGH HE HAD HIS OWN PROGRAMS FOR IMPROVING THE LOT OF OTHER
PEOPLE. WHITE NORMALLY RESPECTED SUPERIORS AND THEIR AUTHORITY, AS
LONG AS THEY MADE SENSE TO HIM. BUT, HE WOULD BALK AT OBEYING SOMEONE

FOR WHOM HE HAD LOST RESPECT. THIS TENDENCY LED TO AN
INCIDENT AT ROTC ADVANCED CAMP AT FORT RILEY, KANSAS, IN THE SUMMER
OF 81, WHEN WHITE REFUSED TO OBEY A CADET'S ORDER (NO FURTHER INFOR-
MATION), AND WAS ALMOST BOARDED OUT OF THE CAMP.
7. (C) WHITE'S SERIOUSNESS, INTELLIGENCE, AND INTENSITY SEEMED
THREATENING TO SOME CADETS AT KMSC. HE TENDED TO REMAIN ALOOF FROM
HIS PEERS. ON TOP OF THIS, HIS POOR SKIN COMPLEXION NERVOUS MANNER
ISMS, AND ERRATIC DRESS (ONE DAY NEAT, THE NEXT DAY SHABBY)
MADE WHITE THE BUTT OF DERISION AND PRANKS AT KMSC. HE WAS OSTRA-
CIZED AND UNIVERSALLY DISLIKED. ED. HIS PEER RATING AT ROTC ADVANCED
CAMP WAS REPORTED TO BE LOW
8. (C) WHITE TRIED HARD TO SUCCEED IN EVERYTHING HE DID. HOWEVER,
HIS SELF-ESTEEM WAS CONSTANTLY BATTERED BY THE ATTITUDES OF HIS PEERS
AND A STRING OF DISAPPOINTMENTS. DURING HIS FIRST YEAR AT KMSC HE
GOT INTO SEVERAL FIGHTS WITH OTHER CADETS. ALSO, HIS GIRLFRIEND (NFI)
BROKE-OFF THEIR RELATIONSHIP, ALLEGEDLY UNDER PRESSURE FROM HER
PARENTS. (WHITE PAPERED A MYRIAD OF PICTURES OF HER ON HIS DORMITORY
WALL.) WHITE DATED SELDOM, IF AT ALL. ONE OF HIS INSTRUCTORS, A
CAPTAIN DAVID, REPORTEDLY GAVE WHITE A ZERO FOR TURNING IN A PAPER
LATE, BUT DID NOT PENALIZE OTHERS WHO HAD DONE SO, AS SEVERELY.
CPT DAVID WAS THE TYPE OF PERSON WHO EITHER LIKED OR HATED OTHERS.
AND IT SEEMED THAT HE DISLIKED WHITE INTENSELY FOR UNKNOWN REASONS.

FINAL SECTION OF 02
9. (C) AFTER WHITE'S NEAR FAILURE AT ROTC ADVANCED CAMP HE-WAS-RE-
CYCLED AT AIRBORNE SCHOOL FOR FAILING THE PT TEST. HOWEVER, HE
RECOVERED AND COMPLETED THE COURSE. WHEN HE RETURNED TO KMSC IN
SEP 81, HE WAS DEEPLY UPSET UPON LEARNING THAT HE WAS ONLY A CADET
SERGEANT FIRST CLASS AND NOT AN OFFICER. WHITE WAS IN SOURCE'S
COMPANY (SOURCE WAS A CADET MAJOR). ON ONE OCCASION, DURING LEADER-
SHIP LAB, SOURCE CORRECTED WHITE WHO WAS IMPROPERLY EXECUTING THE
HIGH AND LOW CRAWLS. WHITE REACTED INDIGNANTLY AT FIRST BUT AFTER
SOURCE EXPLAINED WHAT HE DID WRONG, WHITE ADJUSTED AND CONTINUED TO
PERFORM. ALSO IN SEP 81, ANOTHER CADET (NFI) TOOK ONE OF
WHITE'S BOOKS FROM HIS ROOM VIOLENTLY ANGRY, WHITE DRAPED TOILET
PAPER ON THE CADET'S DORMITORY DOOR AND SET IT ON FIRE. SOURCE
CAUGHT WHITE IN THE ACT OF SETTING THE BLAZE AND LAUGHING ABOUT IT.
MERLINO VERBALLY CENSURED WHITE AND THREATENED TO GET HIM DISMISSED
FROM KMSC. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, WHITE ADVISED THAT HE WANTED TO
LEAVE SCHOOL. HE WAS COUNSELED BY COLONEL JOHNNY PARKER, SCHOOL
COMMANDANT. PARKER ASKED SOURCE FOR HIS RECOMMENDATION. SOURCE
SYMPATHIZED WITH WHITE BUT COULD NOT RECOMMEND HIM FOR A COMMISSION
IN THE US ARMY BECAUSE OF HIS APPARENT IMMATURITY.
10. (C) AROUND 26 SEP 81, BEFORE WHITE LEFT KMSC, HE TOLD SOURCE HE
WAS LEAVING THE SCHOOL. WHITE SAID HE DID NOT WANT TO BE AN OFFICER,
BECAUSE HE WAS "FED UP WITH THE BULLSHIT AND THE ASS-KISSING". НЕ
ADDED THAT HE WAS GOING TO ENLIST IN THE ARMY AND BECOME THE BEST
DAMN NCO HE COULD BE BY HIS COMMENTS AND HIS TONE OF VOICE DURING
THIS AND OTHER CONVERSATIONS, WHITE INDICATED THAT HE WASN'T GETTING
WHAT HE DESERVED FROM SOCIETY. SOURCE WISHED HIM LUCK AND NEVER SAW
OR HEARD FROM HIM AGAIN.
11. (C) SOURCE WAS-NOT-TOTALLY SURPRISED WHEN HE READ-OF-WHITE'S
DEFECTION TO NORTH_KOREA., IT SEEMED TO FIT IN WITH HIS PERSONALITY.
SOURCE GUESSED THAT WHITE'S ACTION RESULTED FROM THE CULMINATION OF
HIS DISAPPOINTMENTS. WHITE-PROBABLY BECAME DISILLUSIONED-WITH-THE
ARMY-OR_HIS_UNIT AND HAD PROBABLY_ENTERTAINED THOUGHTS ABOUT
DEFECTING FOR SOME TIME. HOWEVER, IT WAS MOST LIKELY ONE PARTICULAR
INCIDENT THAT PROMPTED HIM TO TAKE ACTION. WHERE ONCE WHITE WAS-A
FAILURE IN US SOCIETY, HE GAINED NOTORIETY AND AN INTERNATIONAL
AUDIENCE THROUGH-HIS DEFECTION SOURCE BELIVED THAT THE TEXT OF
THE REMARKS-ATTRIBUTED TO WHITE BY THE GOVERNMENT OF NORTH KOREA
SOUNDED LIKE WHITE'S WORDS AND MANNER OF SPEECH, AND COULD_VERY_WELL
HAVE BEEN AUTHORED BY WHITE. AT LEAST THEY PARALLELED WHITE'S
IDEALISTIC BUT NAIVE SOCIO-POLITICAL VIEWS.
12. (U) OTHER SOURCES FROM KMSC WHO KNEW WHITE BETTER OR WHO COULD
CONTRIBUTE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED: COL JOHNNY PARKER,
(TEL: 816-882-5623), RICHARD J. HATCH, 2LT USAR, A NATIVE OF PENN-
SYLVANIA, WHO KNEW WHITE BETTER THAN ANYONE, CAPTAIN MICHAEL R.
BASISTA, SGM JAMES MCKANE, AND MSG STEPHEN G. HINK.
