22 September 1955
James A. PEFRY, Jr., mailed the letters from Fashington, D. C., on
29 June 1955, one to his fater, and another to Severino D. 00:12; however,
in so doing, PEFFI placed the letter to his father in the envelope addressed.
to COEZ, and the letter to GUEZ in the envelope addressed to his father.
When the letters were received by PEFRY, Sr. and OOMZ, both noting the
error, they exchanged letters. Hovever, COEZ considered the contents of
the letter he had at first received important enough to turn over to his
brother M. Leal GOMEZ, who in tum referred it to the Boston Office of
the FBI.
The letter, in substance, indicated that while PERRY was serving in
South America, under cover for this Arency, Eo had revealed his true status
to his wife's father, EN CONSALTES, on a visit to South America, and who
later had revealed this information to PERRY's father. In correspondence
following PERI's father having become knowledgeable of PEFFI's true status,
he indicates that therein he night have intimated that his work was not so
hush-hush, and that on that basis P's father "had dropped his card"
in effect, and had told others of PEFSY's true status. This letter was a
warning to PEFFY's father that he should attempt to correct the indiscretion
of revealing PERRY's status while he was in South America. The letter refers
to other letters which PERFT indicates contained information revealed torough
indiscretion on his part, and which he ass his father to destroy.
According to our records, PEFFY was granted an Operational Clearance
on 22 May 1953, for use as a witting informant or as a contract agent on
anti-Communist stunt activit ctivities. a 12s used as a contract agent frבנ
