Status of Document:
Postponed in Part
Number of releases of previously postponed information: 7
Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could

Was employed by the Office of Finance in August,
1975. Duties at that time included handling
payroll for approximately 90 Members of Congress.
In less than one year, I was promoted to one of
only three supervisory positions in the payroll
section. I am currently in charge of all payroll
matters pertaining to all House Committees, which
involves furnishing information on current funding
resolutions, providing accurate records of Com-
mittee allowances, and distributing monthly records
of expenditures for approval by the Chairman of
each Committee. In addition, I am responsible for
the prompt payment of all federal leases of office
space and computer leasing invoices for Members.
I am in charge of maintaining complete records of
the Lyndon Baines Johnson Intern Program, an allowance
furnished each Member of Congress for the employment
of two additional employees each year. I also was
involved in a complete transition of payroll informa-
tion from one computer system to the current Finan-
cial Management System.
