3. Respectable Intellectual Front: Following funda-
mental Communist principles for pass movement work (better
than the JCP itself follows these tenets), the ex-JCP
organizers of BEREIREN kept themselves in the background
and lined up a number of prominent Japanese progressive
intellectuals and leftist cultured persons to front for
BEHEIREN. The choice of ODA Makoto, ex-Fulbrighter and
popular young novelist, to be the chief front man - Chair-
man - was an extremely lucky stroke for BEHEIREN. ODA has
taken to this grand-standing, front work like a duck to
water. It has given him a chance to give unbridled vent to
his own latent anti-American feelings, puffed him up to the
extent that he has been dubbed "the emperor" by other BEWEIREN
activists, and given him at long last an ideological mission
to pursue. YOSHIKAWA has performed magnificently in feeding
ODA's ego needs and in infusing and indoctrinating ODA so
that his words and actions take on sufficiently virulent
anti-American overtones. ODA has served another vital
function for BEHEIREN by recruiting a sizeable number of
fellow intellectuals to join the ranks of BEHEIREN activists.
(Attachment 1 is a listing of a number of those Japanese who
have been identified as active BEHEIREN supporters ог вушра-
thizers.)
4. Organizational Development: In its 2 1/2 year history,
BEPEIREN has not appreciably changed its organizational format,
although it has moved its office three times and modified its
name even oftener. PEHEIREN is not a "pass organization", be-
cause it has had no sizeable popular backing to the present
time. Its hard core, secretariat organization is run by
YOSHIKAWA and his lieutenants. Its public image, intellectual
front is led by ODA, and given body by a score of like-minded
intellectual friends of ODA and YOSHIKAWA, who form the loose
body of EEREIREN's activist leadership. Under this BELEIREN
leadership superstructure lies a paltry base of only several
hundred BEHEIREN "rank-and-file" supporters, mostly young
Japanese students. Organizationally, EEHEIREN has no formal
membership system, so its base of supporters is fluid and not
precisely measurable. However, the base support for BEHEIREN
has definitely been on the upswing during 1967, and made such
notable strides during the past summer that JCP Headquarters
officials finally felt constrained to note with concern that
BEHEIREN was beginning to drain off a growing number of pro-
gressive youth who otherwise would have been absorbed into
the JCP's own youth movement. BEHEIREN leaders have tried to
help this growth along by setting up a youth section, calling
it "Young BEHEIREN." BEHEIREN's imaginative actions and
publicity-conscious programs have been responsible for its
recent growth, and this period of growth seems to be now on

the verge of really picking up speed and momentum. As a result
of its role in the case of the four deserting sailors, BEHEIREN
has reaped bountiful publicity, has succeeded in touching a
delicate Japanese public nerve of sympathy and pacifism, open-
ing a floodgate of support for BEHEIREN from all over Japan.
When this case fades from the limelight, it is still most
likely that a fair percentage of current wave of popular
support for BEHEIREN will solidify into permanent mass backing,
giving BERSIREN, for the first time, a meaningful base to
support its future activities,
5. Activities and Accomplishments: BEHEIREN has engaged
in a number of propaganda actions, and participated in inter-
national anti-Vietnam War activities. It has tried to co-
operate with certain front activities in Japan controlled by
the JCP, most notably the Japan Committee to Investigate War
Crimes in Vietnam activities, which culminated in the Tokyo
Court of last August, but has been soundly and rudely rebuffed
by the JCP. In spite of this, BEHEIREN has churned along at
its own pace, with a continuing series of anti-Vietnam war
actions, most of them related in some way to the American
pacifist movement. In this regard, BEREIREN has succeeded in
cornering a virtual monopoly on Japanese contacts with the U.S.
pacifist movements, and has effectually capitalized on this to
promote its own action program. The case of the four deserting
sailors, while an apparent lucky windfall for BEHEIREN, only
points up the fact that BEHEIREN, through past organizational
work and promotional activities, was "johnny-on-the-spot",
ready and capable (unique in Japan in this regard) to take
the ball and run with it. BEHEIREN ran all the way in this
case and scored its most notable success since it was organized.
(Attachment 2 is a listing of BEHEIREN's more notable activities
since its founding. Attachment 3 is a partial listing of
American and other foreign persons known to have been in
contact with or cooperated with BEHEIREN.)
B. The Case of the Four Sailor Deserters and BEHEIREN.

1. How It Started: The consensus of all available overt
media material, with no recorded dissent, indicates that the
four sailors voluntarily left their ship,
up wallowing around Tokyo's hippie-land.
grievances prompted the four to embark on this mis-adventure is
not yet known. But, up to this point, the four could fairly be
categorized as misguided youngsters, gone astray in a foreign
land, and due to get slapped back in line with traditional
Navy justice when they finally decided to stop the fun and go
back to the ship. So far, this made their cases far from
unique.

2. How It Became an Incident: But instead of returning to
their ship of their own volition or being apprehended by the
Shore Patrol, the four made contact with BEHEIREN leaders.
Again, press reports indicate that this was just a coincidence,
that there was no pre-planning by the four to contact EEHEIREN.
There are no available overt nor covert reports that indicate
otherwise. But, once the BEHEIREN people made contact, they
recognized the potential immediately and moved fast for the
kill. (Attachment 4 is a Yomiuri Newspaper clipping, 22 Nov-
ember 1967, that is both a representative and comprehensive
account of this phase of the case. Even if this article
should contain some minor inaccuracies, the basic line seems
factual and has not been challenged elsewhere.)
veteran
3. BEHEIREN Takes Over: When the four made contact with
PEHEIREN, it suddenly became an entirely different ballgame.
BEHBIREN had everything needed to capitalize on this:
activist leaders who are experienced enough to recognize the
windfall that had come their way; an apparatus that could
provide hiding places for the four; long standing liaison
contacts with Soviet Embassy officials for use in planning
exit from Japan; solid contacts with reliable American
pacifists with whom the bona fides of the four sailors could
be checked; money and organization to capitalize on the
propaganda potential (such as preparing a movie film for the
Initial BEHEIREN press conference announcing the desertion,
prepared more likely than not by BEHEIREN stalwart EUEQ
Keinosuke, an independent film producer) and English speaking
activists capable of sympathizing, encouraging, soothing, or
agitating the four young sailors, so that there would be no
turning back.
4. The BEHEIREN Apparatus At Work: While many of the
small pieces of this puzzle, which would put the whole case in
proper detailed chronological order and eliminate speculation
on minor points, are still missing, enough is known now,
through overt and covert sources, that the picture of BEHEIREN'S
adept handling of this case shines through clearly. The follow-
ing elements, all part of the BEHEIREN apparatus, make up the
bulk of the picture
a) Hide-out: When EEHEIREN got hold of the four on
about 26 October, they had to be hiden out for the approximate
two week period until their exit from Japan could be arranged.
This presented BEHEIREN no great logistical problem. A number
of the BEHEIREN activist leaders have homes well suited to
harboring fugitives. For example, BEHEIREN activist leader
FUKASAKU Mitsusada has a villa hidden away in Chigasaki, which
was used on the night of 12 September for a meeting of about
20 top BEREIREN leaders, and which would be highly suitable
SECRET

for hiding the four deserters. Other privato-dwellings, bc-
longing to BEHEIREN leaders and loyal supporters, are scattered
throughout both the Kanto and Kansai areas.
b) BEHEIREN/Soviet Liaison: EEBEIREN Secretary General
YOSHIKAWA has maintained periodic contact with Soviet Embassy
officials for years. BELEIDEN Chairman ODA has met Soviet
Peace Committee officials in Moscow. The exact means of how
this liaison was accomplished in this case is precisely known
from a covert phone tap on the Soviet Embassy's line. A full
transcript is available of two phone calls made on 30 Octobor,
first by Brian Victoria to Chief Press Attache Nikolay V.
Vasilyevich, and second by YOSHIKAWA to First Secretary
Sergey D. Anisimov, urgently requesting a private meeting
later that day to discuss "an extremely important, extremely
delicate matter", without doubt the case of the four sailors.
:
c) BEHEIREN/U.S. Pacifist Liaison: BEHEIREN contacted
Dartmouth University professor Ernest P. Young, who flew to
Japan on & November, apparently helped BEREIREN leaders check
out the bona fides of the deserters, and returned to the U.S.
on 11 November. (Attachment 5 is the translation of a Sankei
Shimbun article, dated 21 November, reporting an interview
with Young, giving his version of his role in this case.)
5. Escape to Moscow: The four deserters turned up in
moscow on 20 November. The press has speculated widely and
unanimously that the four left Japan on the Soviet passenger
ship Baikal on 11 November. Again, there is no dissenting
opinion, overt nor covert. The only mystery concerning this
final phase of the Japanese portion of this case concerns the
mechanics of how the four boarded the Baikal and who assisted
in this caneauver. But with the sailing of the Baikal from
Yokohama, BEHEIREN completed its most highly successful and
beautifully executed activity in its 2 1/2 year history. Not
only did BEHEIREN smear the American Government's image in
Japan, not only did BEHEIREN gain a vast amount of priceless
publicity that will swell the ranks of its supporters and be
invaluable in future activities, but BEHEIREN doubtlessly
even made a profit, financially, on this low budget operation
- donations are still pouring into BEHZIREN Headquarters from
all over Japan to "help and protect U.S. deserters".

Some BEHEIREN Activities and Accomplishments
1. Regular once-per-month demonstrations at a public park in
Tokyo, consisting of anti-American speeches and followed by street
marches.
2. An all night TV "teach-in" with DEHEIREN activist leaders,
along with special guest, U. S. pacifist Carl Oglesby (Chairman of
the Students for a Democratic Society.)
3. A full page advertisement in the New York Times (16 November
1965), followed by another full page ad in the Washington Post
(3 April 1967), appealing to Americans to stop the war in Vietnam.
4. A "Meet in Conference of Two Nations for Peace in Vietnam,"
held in Tokyo in August 1966, and attended by BEHEIREN activists and
seven U.S. pacifist leaders (including Dave Dellinger), and observers
from France, England, Canada, the USSR, Pakistan, and Mongolia.
5. A mass meeting in Tokyo in October 1966, guest speakers of
which were French pacifists, Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir.
6. Nationwide tours of Japan for lectures and peace rallies for
such anti-Vietnam war pacifists as Professor Howard Zinn and the late
A. J. Nuste of the United States, Claude Bourdet of France, and Thich
Nhat Hanh of South Vietnam.
7. A mass meeting in Tokyo in January 1967, sponsored by
DEHEIREN and featuring U.S. folk singer and pacifist Joan Baez.
8. A continuing program of direct distribution of pamphlets to
U.S. troops stationed in Japan, and those coming to Japan on warships,
and for rest or hospitalization from Vietnaz.
9. Participation by two BEREIREN activist leaders (Kyoto
University professor KUWABARA Takeo and International House staffer
TSURUMI Yoshikyuki, taking advantage of a trip to the U.S. to attend
a non-political Japan-America Congress on Cultural Problems) in
anti-Vietnam war speech rallies and demonstrations at Dartmouth
University in early May 1967, followed by an unsuccessful attempt
to invite Cassius Clay to visit Japan on behalf of BEBELREN.
10. Continuing offorts to bring to Japan for a nationwide

11. Participation in the Stockholm July 1967 "World Conference
Vietnam," by sending two BENEIREN activist leaders as delegates.
12. Cooperation with the U.S. Quakers, pacifists, and Earle
Raynolds in sending the yacht "Phoenix" with medical aid, first to
iphong, then on a second trip in the Fall of 1967, secking but
wiling to find landfall to deliver medical aid to either North or
youth Vietnam.
13. Attempted, but failed due to inability to obtain U.S. visa,
to send a BEHEIREN activist leader (MUTO Ichiyo) to the U.S. to
participate in the 21 October 1967 anti-Vietnam War demonstrations.
14. Currently carrying out a fund raising campaign to send an
aid ship to North Vietnam. In this, and other activities, DEHEIREN
leaders are maintaining ever closer liaison contact with their
counterparts abroad, such as the French "Conite' Vietnam National."
In an effort to generate public support for this aid ship fund
raising campaign, BEMEIREN succeeded in issuing a public appeal,
under the endorsing signatures of Tokyo Governor MINOBE Ryokichi and
Yokohama Mayor ASUKATA Ichio, as well as the usual intellectuals
supporting BEHEIREN.
15. In October 1967, BEREIREN solicited approval to hold anti-
Vietnam War demonstrations in front of the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo,
expecting to be denied and then intending to make this denial a court
test case. Instead, BEHEIREN was given this permission, and conducted
two orderly and well-publicized demonstrations in front of the American
Embassy, garuering a larger public turn out of participants than in
any previous BEHEIREN-sponsored demonstration.
16. Assisted and abetted the defection to the USSR of four
American sailors from the U.S. Navy carrier Intrepid. Following this
success, BELEIREN's most effective activity to date, BELEIREN leaders
are organizing a permanent "underground railway" of Japanese intell-
ectuals who will volunteer their homes as possible "way stops" for
hiding future U.S. military deserters that BEHEIREN now hopes to
induce.

Prof. YOUNG Says Four American Deserter Seamen Not in Japan Any More
Went to Tokyo and Tried to Dissuade Them;
Probably Escaped from Japan on the 12th or the 13th
(New York, November 20, Correspondent Tadashi ONODERA) Professor
Ernest P. YOUNG of Dartmouth College in the U.S., consented to an interview
with this reporter on the question of the four American seamen who deserted

Why did you go to Japan?
LL
Professor: Beheiren contacted David DERKINGER, a pacifist activist
Kin the U.S., asking him to "send someone to Japan to hear the stories of
the four seamen and announce them in the U.S." I have been in Japan twice,
and I also once served as special assistant to Ambassador REISCHAUER.
During that time, I became friends with Beheiren representative ODA' and
other intellectuals in Japan. It was for these reasons that I was given
this assignment. I personally have never participated actively in the
Of anti-Vietnam war movement so far. до прес-
- When did you arrive in Japan, and where did you meet the four
seamen?
o Professor: I arrived. in Haneda on November 8, and met the four seamen
on the 9th and the 10th. The place of interview was in an apartment house
pein Tokyo, but I cannot say at this time where that apartment house was and
as who owned it. However, on both days, I talked fully with these four seamen,
ge for more than three hours on each occasion (according to an investigation
made by the public security authorities, Professor YOUNG arrived in Japan
toward the evening of the 8th, and stayed at Hotel Tanakanwa in Shiba,
cs Minato-ku, until the morning of the 11th)

What were the motives for these four seamen's 'desertion?
Professor: The desertion was completely the decision of these four
persons. It seems that the four seamen decided not to return to the ship,
when the Intrepid entered Yokosuka Port on October 17, and they were per-
au mitted to go ashore for rest for one week. My impression on meeting these
four seamen was that they were definitely not deserting for the purpose of
chself-advertisement or that they were giving false reasons. I am convinced
that they deserted really out of doubt about the Vietnam war.
What were the movements of the four after they deserted?
Professor: On the night of the 23rd, two days before the Intrepid
was due to sail, the four went to Shinjuku, and told the people whom they
met at a bar they happened to visit, that "we are fed up with war." The
Japanese who heard them sympathized with them, and at one time, the four
lived with some hippies (according to this paper's investigations; they
include Mr. K., a student of Tokyo University's Liberal Arts Department,
and vanguard artist A., who gather at Fugetsudo in Shinjuku.) Finally,

they were taken to Beheiren by a student who spoke English (according to
this paper's investigation, this was Mr. S., a Waseda University student).
After that, they were hidden by Beheiren. I cannot say where they were
hidden. את מן
