Fulminator-l's are-Ferra Contract

29 December 1961
1. Attachod heromith please find a pro forma contract which has been prepared
for Fulminater-l's signature. ile has stated that he is in agreement with its
provisions. If this contract is satisfactory please retura it for his signature
at such tino as his clearance is obtained.
2. FULMINATE?-l has shown himself to be very enthusiastic regarding the proposed
employment with this Organisation and is anxious to start the tasks to bo
assigned to hin as scen es his clearance is obtained and the necessary instructions
are fcrwarded to this Station.
5. To carry out the covert prepa, anda wapect of FULMINATIE-l's duties he has
highly recormended the use of Victer POOLSTE Croca. Theo latior is a Chilean,
about 56 years of age, whe is foreman of FULMINATE-1's printing; shop. De also
lives on the premises and would be the caly person who would have to know if the
presses are used at night. Lie is not a member of the printers' labor union and
his past actions have indicated to FANATL-1 that he is 100% anti-Communist.
He has bom employed many years by Luckensic and Co., a British firm wwich shared
the print shop facilities with FCMIRATER-l'a presses. However, FULMI-1's
equipment is entirely separate from Lackenzie's and if the covert work is done
at night as is anticipated it is FULMINATER-1's opinion that POBLETE could run
off the work without any possible interference from other individuals. another
of POBLE T8's advantages is the fact that he is able to perform all the printing
oporations which will be necessary to put out normal propagania and similar
material and this would eliminate the need to use other persons in the
preparation of the prepajanda material.
4. PCBLETE has been closely connected with english and Anglo-Chilean officials
of Lackensie & Co. fer many years but it is believed logical to presuns that if
he is paid generously for his work in this connsetion, with the understanding
that the work is of a completely confidential nature and of a long-term basis, that
he will agree to complete secrecy regarding the work. Amount of payment to
POELETE will have to be determined when there is some indication as to the amount
of work to be done. & local investigation of this person has been initiated and
the results will be forwarded as soons possible. No derogatory information
on this person appears in this Station's files.

paid from other operational funds the peso equivalent of his salary boginning
1 January 1952. It was conátierod necessary to begin his payments es of that
date in order to insure his continued stay in Chile. This Station would
appreciate clarification of JREDICT-Chile to which, according to TC-7-1465,
this expense could be charged for a limited time.
6.5, FULMINATER-I's weekly newspaper is 61% owned by him, and as indicated in
attached contract, he has agreed to keep the paper for at least two years.
The other owner, his has taken no activo interest whatsoever in the operation,
management or policies of the paper, apparently plans to sell his share.
The prospective buyer is not known but in any event PULAMINATER-1 will retain
the controlling interest.
7.
76, FULMINATER-l is willing to spend the necessary time in Washington for
training and will be ready to depart immediately when so advised. However, his
wife is expecting a baby around 30 December 1951 according to her doctor's
calculations, and FULMINATER-1 would prefer to remain in Santiago for at least
a few days after the child is born. He is certain that the birth will take
place within a week's time and it is hoped that his presence in Washington will
not be required prior to 15 January 1952. As a cover story for his trip,
FULMINATER-1 has advised that an option nas been bought on one of his playe
and that a trip to New York to discuss the play with the prospective producer
is completely logical. Further, he has an estate in Texas which is in litigation
and which could logically require his presence there. PULMINALER-1 asked that
ho do allowed to spend a day or two in Texas either on his trip up or back to
settle thia estate and it is recommended that he be allowed to do so in order to
provide his cover story with more basis in fact.
8.7, FULMINACER-1 has been told that he must pay United States income tax on his
salary received from this Crganization. He is at a loss, however, to know how
this added income can be satisfactorily and securely explained to the Department
of Internal Revenue. In accordance with the contents of Field Regulations 50-15,
this matter is being brought to Headquarters attention with a request for
instructions as to how this matter is to be handled.

A. Budgetary data for this Project. (ANNEX A)
B. Field dispatch (TCS-A-1801) outlining the terms of this
Project. (ANNEX B)
C. Headquarters cable authorizing recruitment of FULMINATOR-1

III. PROPOSAL
A. Statement
It is proposed to undertake the development in Chile of a group
or committee composed of Chilean nationals which will engage
overtly and actively in anti-Communist work and will function as
a WIID mechanism for the accomplishment of WED missions (a) and (b)
in Chile, as set forth in Paragraph I above.
As the first step in implementing the development of that committee,
it is proposed to engage the services of a high-calibre American
national in Chile as a contract agent at an annual salary of
$6,000.00 to
1.. Spot, recruit, and manage a qualified indigenous Chilean
who will act as organizer. of the aforementioned committee,
and
2. Act as cut-out and principal agent for, in the
operations of the committee.
At such time as development of the committee warrants, the
necessary steps will be taken to place the committee in the
proper relationship with the DTHABEAS foundation for purposes
of cover and support.
14-00000
B. Background
The American national in question is a former WPD/050
agent (FULMINATOR-1) of proven ability, courage and
discretion.
FULMINATOR-1's present occupation in Santiago, Chile,
provides him with excellent contacts and cover for
carrying out the tasks proposed for him above.
He is part owner of, and holds the controlling interest
(51%) in a Santiago printing and publishing establishment
that publishes an English-language newspaper, The South
Pacific Mail, which FULMINATOR-1 edits. His establishment
is well equipped to handle a great variety of printing
jobs.
C. Current Status
On 23 January 1952, WHD Headquarters authorized its
Santiago Field Station to hire FULMINATOR-1 as a
contract agent for a period of at least two years
(See ANNEXES B and D). In his agent capacity, FULMINATOR-1
will undertake to develop the committee referred to above
in Paragraph A of this Outlinė.
At such time as that development warrants, an Amendment
to this Project containing a statement of all new require-
ments, will be submitted to competent authority for
approval.
IV. RECOMMENDATION
That there be allotted to this Project funds in the amount of
$4,700.00 to provide salary for FULMINATOR-1 for the remainder of
Fiscal Year, to cover the cost of bringing him to Washington for
a period of covert training, provide his per diem allowance while
here, and transport him back to Santiago, Chile following that
training period.

2. The SH Field Station, Santiago, Chile, will exercise
field control of Project operations in accordance with
instructions from Feadquarters.
C. Personnel Required
One cleared, witting agent to act as Project principal agent
and cut-out (FULMINATOR-1).
D. Communications Plan
Available WHD pouch and cable facilities between Headquarters
and the Santiago Field Station.
E. Support Plan
1. Training
The Project's principal agent will receive approximately
one month of covert training in Washington, D. C., and
return to Chile. All expenses in connection with this
training are to be borne by WHD.
F. Reports Procedure
Progress reports will be submitted to HD Headquarters by
the Santiago Field Station in accordance with Headquarters
directives.
G. Cover and Security
1. Cover
FULMINATOR-l will remain in Chile in his present business
position. As a cover story for his trip to washington for
covert training, FULMINATOR-1 has advised that an option
has been bought on one of his plays and that a trip to
New York to discuss the play with the prospective producer
is completely logical.
2. Security
On 10 January 1952, WHD received an CPC Operational Clearance
on FULMINATOR-1.
1..4
:
;
14-00000
Communications between FULMINATOR-1 and the Santiago
Field Station wil at all times be carried on by means
of a secure cut-out.
Since FULMEATOR-1's cover is his overt business situation
in which he is already established, and since that situation
provides him with printing and publishing facilities, it is
believed the good operational security can be maintained
with a minimum of effort in this Project.

Meeting with Agent, Paul D. LAGI on 20 April 1952
1. The sense of the following text was obtained aming
an afternoon meeting with Agent LANGEVI!!. Participating in
the tall: vere Nessrs. Sryser and Patton and Agent LANGEVIN.
Four rajor topics were discussed and will be presented here
in the order in which they were developed.
2. Printing Plant Problem: 1. LANGEVIN indicated that
in two and a half to three months cortain financial obliga-
tions would come due. These consisted entirely in making an
$8,000 payment arising from the purchase of equipment for his
printing establishment. This equipment, which cost about
$10,000 when purchased late in 1951, consists of an Italian-
made press, linotyre machine, Speed Graphic cameras, tyre,
etc. The market value of this equipment (partly new and
partly used) is estimated to be at least $10,000. The sum of
$3,000 represents the total indebtedness of LANGEVIN's plant
and is owed to a Mr. MACKENZIE of Casa Mackonzic. l. LANGEVIN
ray meet this payment by either (1.) securing a loan from a Fort
Worth, Texas, bank using his share in family oil interests as
collateral, (2) taking on a Chilean partner, (3) getting the
money from a Chilean bank (which would involve an 18% interest
rate) or (4) getting the money elsewhere. Common agreement was
expressed on the undesirability of taking on a Chilean partner
since this would be a security hazard in any future Fl work,
and would also eliminate the possibility of using the plant as
cover for another agent. 15. LANGEVIII, asked about his previous
statement about leaving Chile after two years, roplied that now
there was no definite plan or desire in that direction. Бе
indicated he would have some idea about the possibility of
assistance from a Texas bark within a few weeks. T. LANGEVIN
also suggested that he would gladly use his earnings for the
next two years from the agency ($6,000 per year) if the Agency
could put up the $8,000 in a lump sum. The printing firm is
now making a profit above the salary which LANGEVIN takes out.
3. Priering on the Comittee: Mr. SIYSER discussed the
overall tasks which LANGEVII is expected to perform. Much
emphasis was placed on the need for security in explaining
this type of IW activity, particularly if and when DTHABELS is

brought in.. LANGEVIII indicated that his cover for con-
tacting the Embassy was good, and further indicated that no
unauthorized person in Chile knew of his U. S. Government
activities.
4. Information on FUGLER: When questioned about the
discretion of FUELER, LANGEVIII indicated complete confidence,
stating that she was very efficient and would be useful in
assisting him in Pl work. LANGEVIN was thoroughly briefed on
the fact that FUMELER must never now of DHASE'S or its con-
nection with the committee.
5. Words and Deeds: Mr. LANGEVIN stated that the format,
paper, type and photoengraving of this pamphlet was far above
Chilean standards. He said that Chile had only one printing
house capable of producing such work, and no artists of the
caliber exhibited in the pamphlet. He suggested a Spanish or
French attribution on poorer paper. The reproduction of posi-
tives is also not done in his plant, but must be contracted for
at a Santiago photoengraver's.
6. Bank: Details: Mr. LANGEVIN has opened an account at
the Chemical Bank and Trust, 74th Street and Madison Avenue,
New York City. All future monthly payments will be rade to
that bank, beginning with the payment for April.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTOR (PLANS)
SUBJECT:
Project PBGROVEL, Amendment No. 1
1. Amendment No. 1 to Project PBGROVEL proposes the loan
of the sum of $8,000 at 4% interest per annum to a contract agent
in Santiago, Chile, in order that this agent may complete payment
on machinery and equipment recently installed on the premises of
the printing establishment of which said agent is sole proprietor.
2. The propriety of CIA lending funds for this purpose has
been reviewed by Opo/SRI who is of the opinion that in principle
there should be no objection. The question of operational use by
Opo has been raised with the WH Division and it has been stated
that this oquipment, consisting of the press, linotype machine,
Speed Graphic cameras, etc., can be used for Opc propaganda pro-
duction purposes.
3. The question of control of the contract agent was dis-
cussed and it has been determined that the Goneral Counsel's Of-
fice is being requested to establish legal means whereby the liên
or mortgage on this equipment will be held in the name of a cut-
out. In the event of any untoward action on the part of the con-
tract agent or disagreement between the agent and CIA, action can
be taken to assumo control of the machinery.
4. As is indicated in the attached memorandum from the Chief,
WH Division, the contract agent is considered to be an individual
of high intelligence and personal integrity. For this and the
above listed reasons, it is recommended that Amendment No. 1 to
PBGROVEL be approved in the amount of $8,000.
