1. Subject is contacted by a member of this Mission about twice a
month usually on a seri-social tesis. Subject is quite familiar with the
workingston based on his experience in Panama, his frequent
visits there, and his contacts with this office curing the jaw
From time to time subject provides bits of information cr opinions ca local
affairs which he thinks may be of interest. Ways in which he could be of further
operational use have also been discussed with him in general terms. Subject
has provided his name for use in registering a station autcnobile and for
cbtaining postoffice tozes.
2. Subject appears to be well versed in some of the operational methods
of the organization and has always expressed a willingness to assist in any.
way possible. This might include acting as a cut-cut, famishing general
political and Communist information, setting up cover establishments, and lie
development of informants in several fields. To date, no specific cpening for
his services has been evolved but it is highly likely that such a spot will
appear in the future.
3. This Mission foresees no strong obstacle or reason against subject's
being contacted by JUMP again but feels that if subject had any inform
tien of possible interest to this organization he would immediately contact
the writer. In addition, such a contact might possibly re-kindle subject's
previcusly expressed feeling that at times it appeared that "the left hand
didn't know what the right hand was doing". It is suggested that if KUJUMP
has ary specific type of infomation in mind, questions indicating the line of
interest could be forwarded to this Mission and placed before subject for his
corment. If KUJUMP particularly desires to interview subject it is suggested
that this Mission be authorized to so inform subject so that the matter vill
appear completely coordinated in subject's mind.

with the thought that he was qualified to organize a net directed aminot
a target of high priority interest. His services were termicated in
April 1549 when he took residence in Mexico for business reasons.

OPERATIONAL REVIE
PERIOD COVERED: 20 October, 1947 to present.
Subject's original assigment was the estab-
lishment of an intelligence net for the
Republic of Panama with a view to developing
infomation on our varicus YANNER objectives.
The assignment was too bread because sub-
ject is establishing a new business and has not
had sufficient time to devote to our work.
Eis activities were redirected along the lines
of cultivation of specific individuals.
His cultivation and recruitment of the
informant HIDRACTD was excellent. His hand-
ling of the subject of "ZF-A-200 was ex-
cellent. His handling of HYDRATANTAC has.
been unsatisfactory in that he has not spent
sufficient time on the project. He states
he will correct this deficienty. His latest
assigrment is the penetration of communist
circles in the Patioral University of Panama.
He has recruited an excellent individual
for this purpose who will be employed at a
salary of one Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00)
per month. This project is approximately
one year old.
To date subject has rot received a salary,
but has been compensated socially and by

this is done we intend that his solary be
One Hundred Dollars per month (100.0)
per monts. He no longer has cover in his
activities as concerns the C. 3. Am

tais area. This is due to the fact theyGen.
Sibert CARCarib attempted to recraft him
as an amy informant after subject hat
perfomed two week's active duty with
Army Intelligence. To avoid refusing the
General's request, subject Infomed him
that he was processing his infomation
thrown LIE. Since that date, amy CIC
men have called at sebject's place of busi-
ness inquiring for information. However,
we seen to have his real loyalty and we are
the ones who can provide him with funds to
cultivate sub-agents.
As stated above subject has perfomed ex-
cellent services but has not devoted a
great deal of time to our work. His in-
terest has greatly increased since you
permitted HYDROL to receive home office
training. He has fairly good contacts and
is capable of cultivating almost any one
we might wish. His services should become
more valuable in the immediate future.
To date subject's intelligence information
has only been valuable as a supplement to i
other sources. His operational infomation
has been excellent and is of real value.
He is more interested in the operational
side of cur activities than in reporting.
This agent has been handled as outlined
in T2F-151 subject to the modifications
of increased social contacts necessitated
by the fact that subject's wife is in-
terested in the social advantages to be
gained from her husband's activities.
We plan to continue using this agent to
cultivate other potential agent personnel.
His primary continous project will סס דפי

current schooling. This project is still in
the development or probationary stage in that
HYDROL's background is such that he regarda
the sky as the limit in the expenditure of
Intelligence Mads and is inclined to commit
himself financially without real assurance
that we will receive full value for the funds
expended. Realizing that time is an impor-
tant factor in the development of high level
operations we hope this will prove to be
the most efficient expenditure of our funds.
If not we will convert the funds to other
projects. As a matter of operational er-
zacization we feel our ultimate objective
in this area should be to ferret out and
operate with a nimimun number of skilled
American resident agents. Offsetting the
criticism mentioned stove are the facts
that subject man of och e
