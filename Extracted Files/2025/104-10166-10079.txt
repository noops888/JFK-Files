Letters Received by ANCORE-E
REFERENCE
As stated below
REF: UPOR 3613, 3 January 1963
1. Headquarters appreciates receiving the enclosures to UFOT 2737
and the reference. The usefulness of this material, however, could be
enhanced considerably if ANCORE-2's source were guided as to the items
to be diverted. Also, headquarters envisions an excellent possibility
for placing or exchanging items, were it possible to communicate with
ANCORE-2's source. Could this be achieved, a profitable relationship with
the source might develop, gradually dropping ANCORE-2 out of the picture.
2. JIGAVE is requested to try to get the identity of ANCORE-2's source
and/or to consider ways to establish contact.
