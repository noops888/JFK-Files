MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation with AMBIDDY-1
DATE:
7 January 1965, 2130 Hours

1. AMBIDDY-1 reported that Manolin Hernandez arrived
from Central America and reported that Vico Starke and
Frank Marshall, with the support of General Anastacio Somoza
of Nicaragua, were planning a coup against President Francisco
Orlich in Costa Rica. A-l planned to depart Miami for Managua
at 0700 hours, 8 January on Lanica airline to check this infor-
mation with General Somoza and to attempt to ensure that his
equipment is not being used to carry out the coup. A-1 will
have his private communications pad and promised to send us a
message as soon as he talked with General Somoza and with the
Orlichs and Starke in Costa Rica.

2. A-1 agreed to try to return to New York on Saturday,
9 January, for a meeting with Mr. Archer (Chief, WH). A-1
will call as soon as he arrives in New York at which time
arrangements will be made to bring him to Washington for the
meeting.

3. A-1 reported he and Al Burt had signed a non-aggression
pact. A-l feels there is little to gain from his point of view
in continuing the squabble with Burt.

8 March 1985
MEMORANDOM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Fhase-out of ARTINE Autonomous Group

1. On the night of 5 March 1965, the case officer for
Manuel ARTINE Buesa net with him and outlined the policy
decision reached by the 303 Committee on 4 March. ARTINE
vas told the decision was to terminate our operational
relationship in as friendly and cooperative manner as
possible, but not later than 1 May 1965. The case officer
had been empowered to convey this information and to con-
duct an exploratory discussion of the problems and possible
solutions connected with a phase-out progran. The two
main points the United States Government was concerned
with were (a) fair but reasonable demobilisation support
to the personnel of the autonomous group, and (b) ARTINE'.
assistance in insuring that the balance of power in Central
America vas not upset, particularly by preventing the
weapons of his group from falling into the hands of
political extremists or free-booters.

8. ARTINE had been on notice for several months that
a phase-cat might be ordered at any time, and had an inkling
that the decision had been made because his regular monthly
subsidy had not been received on schedule. He had obviously
given the matter considerable thought and made up his mind
as to his course of action when he arrived at the meeting.
He began the discussion by summarizing the things he might
have done had he been so inclined. Among the possibilities
mentioned, he included loading up his troops and weapons
and taking over Haiti as a base against Cuba, intervening
in Costa Rica to bring down the libera, PLN administration
in favor of a rightist junta of dissidents, or throwing in
completely with General Anastasio A in Nicarague the
weapons, personnel and equipment of the autonomous group.
He has the capability of fielding an infantry battalion
reinforced with artillery (4.2 mortars), supported by air
and maritis elements, with a cadre of trained and combat-
experienced Cubans, provided he teams up with an organisation

14-00000
L
-2-
who can furnish about 1,000 men to flesh out the unit.
Case officer acknowledgwu laat ve recognized his potential
for harmful action, had considered it thoroughly, and
ARTIME said
hoped he would not do anything of the kind.
he had also considered all the possibilities and concluded
there was no point in his being childish and trying to
"bite us about the ankles."

3. ARTIME accepts the decision and will cooperate
in a phase-out progran. He does not understand the
rationale, and, of course, does not agio with the
decision, but he acknowledges our prerogative to make it.
If we really wish still to be friends, he is willing,
just as he told Mr. FitzGerald originally. He asks only
that we help him make it possible to remain friendly and
makes two requests from us: (a) help take care of his men.
and their families until they can rehabilitate and
resettle themselves, and (b) do everything possible to
got his parents out of Cuba.

4. The major elements to be considered in a phase-
out vere discussed with the following results:
a. Personnel. The first priority is support
payments to dependents which were due 1 March in
the total amount of $100,00. This must be cone
soonest if ARTINE is to maintain control of the
situation. The next most inmediate problem is.
re-entry permission for fifteen of his men who have
been stranded in Nicaragua trying to return to the
United States since. December. These men were ex-
filtrated "black" from the United States with our
assistance and require special authority for...
re-entry from Department of State and Department of
Justice, which we thought was arranged in early
January.

The denobilisation plan proposed by ARTIME
seened as realistic and effective as could be hoped
for. Pe proposes to return the bulk of his mon,
approximately 200, to the United States during March
and give them one month's pay on 1 April as a mustering
out payment to support then and their families while
they seek other employment. The balance of his men,
less than 100, will be held in Central America for
one month longer as a security and administrative
force muster the group's equipent at Monkey Point
from which disposition can be made during the month

14-00000
L
-3-
of April. The security force will be returned
during April and will be paid a mustering out pay-
ment on 1 May. This will terminate the project.

The cover story which ARTINE intends to use
for demobilization is to inform his nen that their
mothership is out of commission and will require about
six voors for repairs. This is true enough so that
it will be believed. He will then grant leave to all
men with dependents to get their personal affairs in
order before operations commence again. He will
publicize the fact that it is less expensive and
better for morale to send them on leave than to have
men sitting around the camps with no operations to
run. When all the first contingent are back home,
individual notice will be given each to start looking
for other work as operations have been postponed.
They will be told that the salary payment of 1 April
will be the last one and should be considered as a
mustering out bonus. ARTINE feels this method will
soften the impact and lover the noise level as the
men will be home with their families and scattered
throughout the community instead of being in an
organized group in Central America when they realize
they are being demobilized.

b. Funda. ARTINK had done his homework and
brought with him facts and figures upon which phase-
eut costs could be estimated. These cost estimates
are outlined below:
1 March - $100,000 Dependents support and
salaries
Travel from Central America
to U.S. for approx. 200 men
50,000 Accrued debts due 1 March,
$5,000
mainly food and other expenses
for camps in Central America
$175,000 (In lieu of regular monthly
subsidy of $225,000)
---
1 April - $100,000 Mustering out payment for
200 men and salaries for
security and administrative
details
12,500 Travel from Central America
to U.S. for approx. 100 men
12,500 Estimated food and other camp
expenses

14-00000
L
1 May - $ 50,000 Mustering out payments for
approx. 100 men and final
contractual obligations of
project
$50,000

c. Weapons. ARTINE agreed that it would be in
nobody's interest for his weapons to fall into the wrong
hands. He was asked for ideas on disposition of the
arms and came up with the following suggestion which
appears to be an excellent one. The mothership, XV
BANTA MARIA, is in need of repairs and must go into a
shipyard. Tentative arrangements have been made to
put her in the yards at Galveston, Texas, some time
in March or April. ARTIME can order his security detail
to store the arus aboard the ship for "security" reasons
before she leaves for the yard. They will simply re-
main on board when the ship leaves and we can take
control of the ship and the weapons from that point on.

d. Maritime,
(1) MV SANTA MARIA. See above. The ship
vould be sailed from Monkey Point with a contract
crew supplied by Chester, Blackburn, & Roder, Inc.
of New York, who are agents for the ship's owner,
Libernic Corporation, a CIA proprietary company...
One of ARTINE's senior officers would accompany
the ship as his representative, "with orders to
turn over control of it and the arms upon its
arrival at Galveston. CIA officers, possibly
documented as Customs officials, would accept
custody and Office of Logistics could recover the
weapons and any other equipment which might be
shipped by this method. The ship would then be
disposed of according to Headquarters wishes at
any time after 17 April when the charter arrange-
ment with General SOMOZA expires and the ship
legally reverts to control of the owner.

(2) Swifts, V-20's, Boston Whalers, rubber
boats and other operational craft are all owned,
technically, by ARTIME's group. He has had titie
to the Swifts legally transferred from a Costa
Rican politician to one of his own senior officers.
He wants to retain these craft for the time being,
hoping against hope that lightning will strike and
he may, after all, be able to use them in the next

14-00000
L
-5-
two months. Case officer recommends we go along
with him on this. at least for the time deing, as
it could be sticky legally and might antagonize
hin at the time whoa ve most need his cooperation.
In the and, he should be reasonable about disposi-
tion of these craft if we shoot square sith him
in the meantime..

(3) Support craft, LCMs, Barges, etc. Dispo-
sition arrangements to be worked out together on
these craft.

e. Aircraft.
(1) DC-3. ARTIME is willing to release the
aircraft back to its "owners," TASA, a CIA pro-
prietary company in Panama, However, one month's
charter payment of $1,250 was due 1 March, and
another will be due by the time the aircraft can
be returned. ARTIME was reluctant to et the plane
go back without payment, but also reluctant to
squeeze the $2,500 out of his budget. Case officer
voiced his opinion that the owner would probably
be glad to get the plane back and would not likely
think it worth going to court. However, in view
of the fact that it would be a "closed-circuit"
transaction and would actually cost the Government
aothing, it is recommended that a special authoriza-
tion of $2,500 be channeled to ARTIME for payment
in order to maintain ARTINE's reputation for fiscal
probity. He will surely appreciate this gesture.

(2) L-20 Deaver and Cessna-180. These
aircraft technically belong to ARTIME's group and
recovery would be a sticky matter, legally.
ARTINE hopes to hold control of these aircraft
for the time being, and it is recommended that
wo go along with him, saving disposition arrange-
monts until later.

5. ARTINK again emphasized at the close of the mooting
that he must have soonest the March payments for families
an an absolute minimua, before he ould face his people and
maintain control of then in order to insure an orderly phane
eut program.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Chief, WH reasrks on termination of ANWORLD

1. At a meeting with DCWHD/C and Mr. Jenkins on
16 March, Chief, WH expressed general satisfaction with
the status of termination of AMWORLD and the plans
therefor. He stated specifically that he was pleased
with the cooperation of AMBIDDY-1 and ANJAYA-4 and would
make it a point to injorn higher levels in the Agency and
the U. 8. Government and put a good word for them on the

displayed in accepting and executing the U. 8.
Government decision to terminate their operations.

b. He wants to meet with then personally, at
the earliest mutually convenient tise, in order to
discuss the situation with them.

c. After termination of the paramilitary project
is completed, he has some other ideas for ventures of
mutual interest which he wishes to pursue with thon,

2. The gist of the above points had been passed to
AMBIDDY-1 and AMJAVA-4 previously by Mr. Jenkins, and on
the night of 18 March he confirmed by telephone to AMJAVA-4

Reference : DIR 98189

1. Hof cable raises a number of fundamental issues of concern to Caracas
Station. In brief, we do not welcome an activation of the movement's center
in Carras, in event which would greatly complicate our operational situation.
to have reasons for believing that the host government likevise would probably
embarrassed if AKBIDDY 1 chose Venezuela as a base for whatever program be
is planning to undertake. Repeated failures of his attempts at being received
by President LEONI are significant in this context.

Since ve must assume tht ANBIDDY 1 has alluded to his close ties with
MUBARK (and nors specifically with BECKHOFF), the Venezuelan security services
may well jump to the conclusion that ANWORLD is in fact & KUBARK operation and
sooner or later we would be forced to disavow ANDIDDY 1, a circumstance of
thich he would be bound to learn with consequent esbitterment. All these
predictable developments, Caracas is most anxious to forestail. Seedless to
say, both BECKHOFF and OPTRICK are unhappy about this situation of conflict
since it involves as we both admire and who (in their opinion) has served
CUTORE isteeste loyally, at times to the detriment of his abiding cause to
liberate PaНИКИ.

3. For the above reasons, we would welcome indeed it formal and
institutional ties between AXBIDOY 1 and ANJAVA & could be put in abeyance, at
Least to the extent that AKBIDOY 1 be prevailed upon to pass up Venesuela as
bese of operations. Dis discriminatory approach reflects our amresses that

4. De realise that the Station's position, as set forth above, وعندممه
Beadquarters with an exceedingly delicate tase. hile as a last resort
could of course drop discreet siste to our Venezuelan liatsus contacte
suggesting the icerisatility of affording ANBIDO i and his associates
sanctuary in Venezuela, we would only entertain that distasteral prospect as
a last resort and with the fill approval of Headquarters.

5. Another approach, only slightly less unsatisfactory, vould be to
restrict ANBIDDY 1's radive of activity to an extent tantamount to denying
hin all freedom of political action while in Venesuela. But all in all, it
would probably be best for KUBARK if ANGIODY I could be dissuaded from going
through with his proposed move in a macer which does it hurt his pride and
which does not alienate him from KUBARK. Headquarters may be able to suggest
palatable alternatives to Venezuela.

6. As regarde ANJAVA, we share some of Headquarters alsgivings about
surfacing him to Liaison. What prompted us to suggest this approach was a
desire to overcome the difficulties which would be facing AMJAVA 4 in any
case should he decide to make his home here. We are inclined to doubt that
be could obtain permission to enter Venesuela in immigrant status without
powerful intercession. He would be used by the Station on projects which
we (and presumably the host government) view as compatible with Venezuela's
national security intereste.

7. Bons of the doubts raised by Headquarters are altogether valid and
ware considered before we sade our proposal. We are least concerned, hovaver, abo
the issues of dual loyalty and dual control etc, because it happens to be ana of
our objectives in building a more durable relationship with Liaison, esp DIGKPOL,
to entice them into joint ventures where dual control does exist. find AMJAVA 4
temperamentally suited (esp since his basic loyalty belongs to KUBARK) to sarve
as an operational link between Station and: liaison, without acting to the
detriment of either. Although the tenor of our relationship with DICEPOL Joas
undergone a notable improvement, there are still deep-rooted reservations and
suspicions which a man of AMJAVA, 4's personality traits sight heir to dispaz.

8. with regards to the suberance of our operations against: PERUNEN,
especially those which are CB-oriented, there is a natural magruity of interests
betuwen ODYORE and Venezuela which renders joint pursuits in fact most desirable.
pre likely than not, Dado Station the favor of facilitating the
adniasion of ANJAVA & and of providing bin ith viable cover, maybe inclu
official (DIGEPOL) documentation, and let it go at that.. we rather doubt that
unless prodded by Station DIGKPOL would avail itoaks or ANJAVA a marvicee, let
alone use him to penetrate Station's operational program. This leaves in the
balance the pros and cons of surfacing a valuable KUBARK asset to lisica.
