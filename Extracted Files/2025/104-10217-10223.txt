LIVER FUNCTION TESTS
On 24 October 1968, I saw Dr. Daly of the 310-chemistry
Laboratory of West London Hospital for liver function
tests. My family doctor, Dr. Hodes, sent me to Daly as
a private patient, as British practice is not to take these
tests unless the patient's condition seems to be worsening.
My doctor thought I showed no signs of a recurrence of
hepatitis and the normal practice would have been, at cost,
for me to have been examined by the specialist at the
hospital, who might then decide to ask for the tests.
Daly said that all required tests, except the B.S.P.,
would be done. He said he thought the 3.S.P. unnecessary
unless the others indicated negative factors. In which
case, he said he would ask me to come in again for that.
test.
Daly will send me the results of the tests and his bill
c/o American Express, Rome, within a week.

1. After considering several alternatives and given QRPHONE/1's
lack of financial forward planning, LCPIPIT believes that it would
be beneficial and advantageous for WOFIRM to offer to subsidize a
portion of an overt life insurance program designed to give him both
life insurance and a cash value toward retirement. We have dis-
cussed this with QRPHONE/1 and he has agreed to the desirability of
such a program. He is willing to participate in such an arrangement
and has undertaken to explore the possibilities available to him.
We are forwarding under separate cover a copy of several proposals
which he has received from the local representative of a reputable
WOLADY insurance firm.
2. LCPIPIT requests authority to subsidize up to 1/2 of the
cost of a life insurance program for QRPHONE/1. (This WOFIRM portion
not to exceed $50 per month.) From an administration standpoint
this would merely take the form of an increased monthly payment and
we would take the necessary steps to verify that the funds were
indeed being devoted to their designated purpose.

HEPATITIS BOUT
What I had thought was a touch of malaria and the extreme
fatigue I felt when I returned to London in July proved in
time to have been acute infectious hepatitis. The disease
--
which takes two to three weeks to develop -- was probably
contracted in Uganda. At least, I imagine so because my
principal contact in Kampala insisted on taking me to a number
of local restaurants of dubious cleanliness to sample Uganda
delicacies.
Hepatitis was diagnosed by a doctor in Komiza, Vis, where
my family had been holidaying since the beginning of July,
and I was hospitalized in the isolation section of Split
Hospital (there is no hospital on Vis) on the 7th of August.
My liver was swollen by one finger and blood and urine
analysis indicated a fairly severe infection. Treatment
consisted of terramycin and cortisone therapy, with massive
doses of vitamins.
I was put on a fat-free diet, which I have been told to
follow for at least six months. Naturally, no alcohol.
On 20 August, I was released from the hospital, mainly be-
cause I was pestering the doctors to let me go. I was
told to have * "absolute rest for four to six weeks and to
have another blood test within several weeks.
(Attached is the Yugoslav doctor's description of my case
and treatment, with results of all blood and urine analyses.
It is written Grattan in Serbo-Croatian.)

1. The following information was obtained by
from /l at their meeting on 4 September 1968. It
supplements the report which was submitted by/1 which
deals with his recent hospitalization for hepatitis.
2. Toward the end of his African trip 1 had been
feeling rather weak and nauseous, with no appetite. He was
constipated, feverish and had gas pains. These symptoms
persisted and after his return from Africa and on 6 August,
while in Yugoslavia on vacation,
suffered from acute
gas pains and vomiting. He was taken from Vis, where he was
vacationing, to Split where he was hospitalized. The address
of this hospital is:
Opca Bolnica
Zarazni Odjel (Firule)
Split, Yugoslavia
His doctor was Dr. Juraj FILIPOVIC.
3./l's treatment was free inasmuch as he was able
to show his British National Health Card and a reciprocity
agreement exists between Britain and Yugoslavia.
4.
3/1 states that at no time did he receive
narcotics nor was he ever unconscious. During his stay in the
hospital a young British youth (Derek WHITTAKER, age 19, from
Shoreham-by-Sea, Surrey) was in his ward suffering from food
poisioning.
