1. DCHAR ves asked first to bring me up to date on what he and the others
in his group have been doing and he reported that they were not doing mich of
anything except waiting. Waiting, first, for some funis which they are expertiag
to come primarily from the sale of the 3-5; and, second, waiting for the esta
lishment of sore better commisation with their contacts in Cusa.
2. With regard to the sinaft, DM told me on this date that he believes
he does now have a sale for the aircraft and he thinks the sale price will be between
03$50 and US$55 thousand.

3. AR se i that plz has communicated with comeone co (he vasn't sure cf
the name) in an attempt to it funds fama people in Ciba. EAR presente:
this in the light that co was "authorizing" some people in Cuba to go ahead
and solicit funds. In this acnection, DER mentioned that at pre time in the
past Julio LOBO (note: this name has never been mentioned in any previous conversations
with this group) had considered donating 134100 thousand for the air force school
which DEAR was promoting at that time, ut apparently became frightened of the
deal and nothing along this me materialized. DOEAR said that he was hopef that
sonetine he would be able to reestablish contact with 1030. All is references
entirely coincidentai to my sizgestions zie to BMW that I mat try to bring
this group together with Julia 030. Zaving learned of this previous connection,
I want to revive this idea ani proceed with the pien to bring these two together.
4. If and when they are able to scriate sore funds, it is their intention
to go ahead with their plans for the establishment of a propaganda program which
would be initially voice radi. ODCHAR said that he had been trying to persuase
OLEDBIAS and EDCOVE to a more new program within the limitations which I had sited
for then in a previous meeting (See -). He said he thinks now that this is
the more realistic approach, Dove holds to the original thinking that they 02
cannot comit themselves to sa initations. DER informed me that DCOVE requests
another recting with me. He was told that I would be away for a few days but veuid
contact hin as soon as I retum.
5.
I then questioned DCER about his mowledge and DBLAS' mowledge of the
presence of Soviet Russians.DER stated that his only information had come
5 to him through Douglas ROOT (ls to the Canadian via DVR referred to frequentiv
in his carlier debriefing SADELLY et al). Root claimed to his to have seen the 05
Soviets in Santiago de Cuba ani DCHAR said that furthermore he had ottained the names
which he passed to Colonel LS in the American Brassy in Serena. When acced if
he thought these were the same Sovith that 13 hei referred to 'n his testirny
in Washington, DCEAR said he felt that they were, although he believed GORIAS
information was obtained independent of als, DCHAR'S, source.

६. Going on in this vein, DCHAR stated that ROOT is one of several people
whom DEAR encouraged to remain in place and to go afing with Raul CASTRO and others
for the purpose of obtaining are specifie formation on Commists and Commist
activities in the armed forces. de said that along this line had been fint-05
duced to Fidel CAS-30's secret, whose name is Marta. at her Milane

3. This group still believed, in of has been reported from te,
thet, while they may have some little font view as to how ORGAR

him.
9. It was learned that is rely Mine in Frank FICRET's house

names of some acquaintances of those whose names are 2:ssian. I have not yet
had an opportunity to discuss this with the COWY agent involveč..
10. I will meet with the poup again at the end of this week, at which tice
I expect they will have some codified position with regard to their activities
and will appeal again for assistance. Martie, it is surenied that DCEAR'S
