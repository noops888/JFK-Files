4. REPORT OF FINDINGS
„Å¶
(LISTED CHARACTER REFERENCE) On 28 October 1968, a physical
check was conducted at 1435 Ogden Avenue, Bronx, New York, New York, in
an attempt to locate Juanita Reyes, listed character reference of Manuel
MARTI, with negative results. A check of the names on the mail boxes in
the apartment building located at the above address failed to reveal any
listing for Reyes. The wife of the building superintendent, name not
furnished, was contacted and she stated that she had never heard of Reyes
and there was no one by that name residing in the building.
AGENT'S NOTES: SUBJECT'S SPH, dated 1 August 1968, reflects the
above address for Reyes. A courtesy letter addressed to Reyes was returned
by the Post Office Department with the statement "Addressee unknown".
