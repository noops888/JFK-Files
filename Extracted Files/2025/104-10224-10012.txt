MEMORANDUM FOR: Lee H. Wigren
VIA: Head of Career Service
FROM: B. DeFelice
Acting Director of Personnel
SUBJECT: Retirement Planning
1. In order to assist employees in planning for their
eventual retirement, it is the practice of the Agency to
inform each employee, well in advance of retirement, of
the services the Agency provides for retirement planning.
2. The prospect of retirement deserves serious thought
and careful planning so that you may make the transition to
the next phase of life with purpose and confidence. To as-
sist you in this regard, the Agency offers various resources
which are attuned to the needs of prospective retirees. You
will, in the future, be invited by a Retirement Counselor to
an individual pre-retirement counseling session, or more
than one if you wish. This phase of retirement planning will be
tailored solely to your own particular situation and circum-
stances and will be within the context of the retirement
system under which you will retire. The individual counseling
sessions are intended to give you a wide range of information
on such matters as estimates of your annuity, survivor bene-
fits, life and health-insurance, Social Security, taxes, and
assistance in obtaining other employment. In addition, you
will be invited to attend a Retirement Information Seminar
that will be offered in the autumn of 1978.
3. Experience has amply demonstrated that advance
preparation eases the transition to retirement. I recom-
mend, strongly, that you avail yourself of the services the
Agency offers you in planning your own retirement.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, DDO Evaluation Boards
FROM: Chief, Counterintelligence Staff
SUBJECT: Promotion Recommendation for Lee H. Wigren
1. I recommend that Lee H. Wigren be promoted from GS-13
to GS-14. Mr. Wigren has been in grade since May 1962 and is
now a GS-13, Step 8. He currently occupies a GS-15, Operations
Officer, Branch Chief position.
2. Mr. Wigren was born 1 December 1923. lle received a
BA degree in Russian Studies from Yale University in 1947 and
an MA degree in History from Harvard University in 1950. He
entered on duty with CIA as a GS-06 clerk in March 1951. He
subsequently attained professional status as an Intelligence
Officer in 1952 and since that time has served variously as
Intelligence Officer, Area Operations Officer, Biographics
Officer, Instructor, and Operations Officer in DIV/D, Europe
Division, SE Division, OTR, and since 1968 the Counterintelli-
gence Staff.
3. Most of Mr. Wigren's career has involved CE and CI
matters. He has been primarily concerned with various aspects
of the Counterintelligence research and analysis activity of
SE Division and, since 1968, the Counterintelligence Staff.
In the course of his various assignments, he has developed a
broad and deep substantive knowledge of the Soviet intelli-
gence and security organs and their activities which has made
him one of our more knowledgeable and effective CI analysts.
lle is careful and thorough in his research, he writes well,
and he has an established reputation within and without CIA
as an interesting and effective lecturer concerning counter-
intelligence matters. His career record reflects a consistently
professional performance of above-average quality in his vari-
ous CIA assignments. Additionally, that record is documented
by several letters of appreciation from other US Government
agencies and foreign liaison services for the highly profes-
sional assistance provided them by Mr. Wigren in the counter-
intelligence field.

4. Mr. Wigren is currently Chief of the External
Research Branch of the Cl Research and Analysis Group.
He is performing the duties and responsibilities of this GS-15
position in a satisfactory manner. He manages the complex
activities of six staff officers and nine contract person-
nel associated with this Branch and is responsible for the
several research programs in which they are involved. He
strives to direct and combine the best talents of the person-
nel under his supervision toward the achievement of his
Branch's objectives while remaining sensitive to the personal
and career interests of his employees. He is especially effec-
tive in dealing with the several contract personnel (including
former defectors) under his supervision who, because of their
professional status and diverse ethnic backgrounds, some-
times require especially understanding treatment.
5. In summary, Mr. Wigren is effectively and satis-
factorily performing the duties of a GS-15 Branch Chief in a
position which requires specialized substantive knowledge
and the ability to manage activities and supervise person-
nel. I believe that his demonstrated ability in this posi-
tion and his sustained record of job performance at an above-
average level since his last promotion clearly merit his
promotion to GS-14 at this time.

Branch's objectives while remaining sensitive to the personal
and career interests of his employees. He is especially effec-
tive in dealing with the several contract personnel (including
former defectors) under his supervision who, because of their
professional status and diverse ethnic backgrounds, some-
times require especially understanding treatment.
5. In summary, Mr. Wigren is effectively and satis-
factorily performing the duties of a GS-15 Branch Chief in a
position which requires specialized substantive knowledge
and the ability to manage activities and supervise person-
nel. I believe that his demonstrated ability in this posi-
tion and his sustained record of job performance at an above-
average level since his last promotion clearly merit his
promotion to GS-14 at this time.
