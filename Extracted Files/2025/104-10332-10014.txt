MEMORANDUM FOR:
Executive Director
Assassination Records Review Board
FROM:
John F. Pereira
Central Intelligence Agency
SUBJECT:
Reconsideration of Releases in Scelso
Testimony and Lopez Report
(We request that this memorandum be returned to CIA
once the Board has completed its deliberations on the issues
discussed below.)
1. (S) Issue. This memo is to request that the _JFK
Board reconsider its decision to release certain information
contained in the HSCA testimony of John Scelso and in the
Lopez Report. Specifically CIA requests that the phrases
"political action program" (pg. 64 Scelso Testimony, pg.
177, 178 Lopez Report); "Mexican police" (pg. 85 Scelso
Testimony); and "is exposed by Agee in his book" (pg. 141
Scelso Testimony) be postponed from release. We also offer
some suggestions for substitute language which we believe
will not detract from the JFK assassination story, yet still
protect the information at issue.
I. Mexican Political Action Program
"We were running, at that time, a vast political action
program in Mexico City to try to swing Mexico around from
its Leftist direction to a middle of the road direction and
it succeeded. I don't know whether you informed yourself
about the magnitude of our political action program there at
the time absolutely enormous"
(Scelso, 64; Lopez, pp. 177, 178)
2. (S) From the early 1950's to the mid-1960's,
Mexico City Station conducted a political action campaign to
minimize leftist influence on and within the Mexican
Government. The campaign utilized student groups, a front
group of progressive businessmen, and Catholic lay group
writers and operatives in political action and media
placement efforts. The Station currently does not have a
political action program designed to influence Mexican

politics, nor has it undertaken such activity anytime in the
recent past. Nevertheless, any public_confirmation by the
U.S. Government of those activities would risk an adverse
reaction. Such adverse reaction would impact on current
Mexico City Station operations and be harmful to U.S.
interests.
CHA Divison officers)
3. (S) As has been described to the Board in previous
briefings by the Merican branch chief, Mexicans guard their
sovereignty carefully. Nothing will infuriate them more
than allegations of CIA meddling in their internal politics.
In fact, earlier this year, the Mexican Government postponed
a visit to Mexico by the DCI for fear that it might be
perceived (and exploited) by the Mexican media and political
opposition as the CIA being called in to assist with
handling the problem of the Peoples' Revolutionary Army.
4. (S) The fact that the CIA activity to which the
Mexicans would object occurred more than 30 years ago will
not lessen the reaction. Release of the Scelso comments
would risk an adverse reaction from the Mexicans, which
would likely include calls for an examination by the Mexican
Government of current CIA activities. This could lead to
increased scrutiny of Station operations and personnel and
could jeopardize our unilateral activities. It could also
have a chilling effect on activities conducted jointly with
the Mexican services, who will be reluctant to engage in
programs that could become subject to public scrutiny and
political debate.
The
5. (S) Furthermore, the fact that these statements
were made by Scelso amounts to an official confirmation of
the underlying facts, making it very difficult for CIA to
protect the same or similar information from further release
in the future. Speculation in books, articles, and other
publications, or disclosures by Congress are often perceived
by the public as evidence that that information is in the
public domain and therefore is no longer classified.
CIA has nevertheless been able to legally protect the
information from unauthorized disclosure. The courts have
held that because there has been no official confirmation,
(i.e. declassification by the appropriate CIA official) the
CIA may continue to protect from release the
the information at issue even when there has been widespread
public discussion on the issue in question.
be
6. (S) In this case, should there by a question raised
as to the classification status of documents on the
political program referred to by Scelso, it would be
difficult to convince a court that such information had not
been declassified because of the release by the Board.
Scelso was a long-time CIA employee who was in charge of the
investigation by the Agency into the assassination of the

President, and his testimony was taken under oath, with the
knowledge of the Agency, and in_a_classified setting.
Furthermore, the attached letter to Louis Stokes, Chairman
of the Select Committee on Assassination from former Acting
DCI Frank Carlucci also indicates that Scelso was acting as
an official of the CIA. The DCI states that any classified
testimony made by Agency staff before the Committees would
be considered "authorized provision" of the information.
This was to ensure that "all persons respond fully and
truthfully" to the Committee. Carlucci's letter, especially
taken together with the first few pages of Scelso's
testimony, make it clear that
official of the CIA.
7.
Scelso was speaking as an
(S) A court would, therefore, probably find that
Scelso's statements were not just merely speculation by a
former Agency employee, but in fact, were official
confirmation of the political action program. Anything
suggesting official confirmation of classified information
would lead a judge to the conclusion that the information at
issue had been declassified by the CIA. This would make it
very difficult for CIA to continue to protect this
information from unauthorized disclosure. When confusion
arises as to the classification status of information, it
could lead to complicated legal proceedings and protracted
and unnecessary litigation at great expense to all parties.
II. Liaison with Mexico
"We did not have any source of Cuban employees. We only had
Mexican police"...We had a whole reporting set up there with
that, two of them, who watched things like that. (Scelso pg.
185).
8. (S) Release by the Board of Scelso's comments about
the Mexican police in conjunction with surveillance coverage
of the Mexico City airport could similarly have a chilling
effect on our current liaison relationship with the Mexicans.
The Station has worked, and continues to work, with liaison
against compatible targets, including tracking the arrival
and departure at the Mexico City airport of targets of
interest. Although the targets have obviously changed since
the time that Scelso is speaking of, these surveillance
operations are ongoing. The success of these current joint
operations could be threatened by any revelation today of
Mexican cooperation with the CIA in the past.
9. (S) CIA objects to this release on similar grounds
as stated in the prior section disclosure of the Scelso
comments would constitute official acknowledgment by CIA of
the assistance provided by Mexican liaison to the Agency.
Such acknowledgment could affect not only current operations

described above, but also result in reluctance by Mexican
liaison to provide similar assistance in the future. The
Mexican Government would likely be subject to criticism by
groups and individuals opposed on nationalism and
sovereignty grounds to such close cooperation with the U.S.
Government and, even more so, with the CIA. The continued
success of CIA cooperation with the Mexicans, whether it be any other
depends on the fact that those relationships are, and
continue to be, secret.
10. (S) CIA requests that the Board continue to
withhold this phrase from release and substitute in "other
sources" or something similar to this. Omitting the fact
that the airport information was obtained from Mexican
counterparts would probably leave the impression that the
information was obtained unilaterally. Although this still
presents some risk to national security, it does achieve
some level of protection to the Station's equities with
liaison.
III. Phillip Agee
(S) "That is, the variety and number of telephone
taps, surveillance teams, photo operations and other
technical operations is exposed by Agee in his book. That
exceeds anyplace else that we had in the world by a lot..."

this Board is well aware, CIA has consistently requested,
the protection of liaison involvement in this teltap
operation. As the Board has agreed with CIA's position on
this matter, the only issue is whether this statement
reveals what we have agreed meets the criteria for continued
protection under the JFK Act.
12. (S) For the Board's convenience, several relevant
pages from Agee's book (Inside the Company: CIA Diary) are
attached. These pages explain in great detail the teltap
operation and the fact that it was conducted jointly between
the CIA and the Mexicans. Although such disclosures by
former employees are disturbing, they do not amount to
official confirmation of the underlying information.
Standing by itself, Agee's book can be dismissed by the
Agency as speculation, and do not compromise CIA's ability
to keep the information classified. Scelso's testimony,
however, amounts to official confirmation of Agee's book,

and does effect the Agency's ability to protect the
information from further release. Equally troubling is the
fact that Scelso's testimony could be read to confirm not
only what is accurate in Agee's book, but also what is
inaccurate.
If Scelso had

used other language, such as "has been written about
elsewhere", the existence of the joint teltap operation
would be protected. We request that the Board protect the
phrase as it is and use the above substitute language.
Such
substitute language would not alter the story of the JFK
Assassination, yet would still allow for the protection of
the joint operation.
13. (S) While the connection between Agee's book and
Scelso's testimony may at first seem attenuated, anyone
involved in the review process conducted by this Board will
know that it is not. Many individuals follow the decisions
of this Board closely, and Agee's writings about the CIA are
also well known. It is to be expected that those who read
the Scelso report would then turn to Agee's book.

Meeting with ARRB Staff
1. Thursday afternoon I met with Dave Marwell,
Executive Director for the ARRB, and two of his staff,
Jeremy Gunn and Mary McAuliffe. I briefed them on the four
releases in the Lopez Report and Scelso Testimony that had
been identified as potential appeal items, and on the
Agency's concerns re the Australian documents. I requested
that the Board reconsider the release of the statements on
Mexico City political action programs, Scelso's comment on
Agee, the reference to the Mexican Police as a source and
Warrenton as site of the Agency's Record Center.

rest of the Lopez Report and Scelso Testimony would be
released on schedule. If the Board accepts the staff's
recommendation, the four items will be addressed at the next
Washington meeting (27 September). If the Board rejects the
staff's recommendation, then we have the option of appealing
to the President. Marwell and Gunn seemed confident that
the Board would agree to delay the release.
3. Gunn requested that the Agency's additional
evidence on these four items (if provided in writing) be to
the ARRB staff by 23 September. The Agency can also brief
the Board members at the 27 September meeting. As I
understand it, DO/Mexico (Mike L.) will be preparing
evidence memos on "political action programs" and "Mexican
police" issues and OGC (Linda C.) will take the lead on
Agee. I will contact the DA/IRO (Don Hatch) on the Warrenton
issue.
4.
Concerning the Australian documents, Marwell agreed
to delay Board action until the 16 October meeting. The
Agency's proposal on these documents should be sent to the
ARRB staff as soon as possible.
