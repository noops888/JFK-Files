Alexandria, Virginia
By Dennis J. O'Brien
For the John F. Kennedy Library
O'BRIEN: I think a logical place to begin in anything
like this is just simply with the question,
when did you first meet President Kennedy,
or Senator Kennedy, if you met him before
he was President?
LANSDALE: I don't recall meeting him before he was

the first Saturday following the inauguration,
: whatever date that was. I was called into a

meeting in the White House by (Robert S.)
McNamara. It was a meeting, on, actually, on
a report that I had written for (Dwight D.

LANSDALE: Just before, that is, a day or so before. I'd
been in Vietnam for a brief visit and got back
just before the inaugural, maybe two or three
days, and at that time both McNamara and
Gilpatric were in Defense getting briefed for
their new jobs. I met them at that time.

I'd like to come back to that. I wonder if
we could go on to talk about one of the major
problems, which is Cuba. When is the first

O'BRIEN: What is the minking about it at that time?
What kind of operation is

A
it
basically a guerilla operation at this point?
LANSDALE: Initially, it was.
Initially, it was very differ-
from 1
ent than the way it turned out. It was based
on a premise that many people in Cuba were very
;
[fid]
unhappy with the Castro administration and the
way it was turning away from the initial
revolutionary objectives and the capture of the
revolutionary movement by the Communist Party,
which surprised many of the supporters of
guerilla
Castro as a guerilla and as
action.

Sof the thought was to back a number
of Cubans who either had been supporters of
Castro or were very unhappy, were still resident
in Cuba, and to cause some overturn at the time.

who had been attached to CIA for temporary

in initially for this specific planning.
December, when the planning had obviously
started coming in with a beach landing and so
on, the way it turned out, I urged at that
point to get military planning in on the
97
thing. I was worrying about it. As a matter
of fact, Allen Dulles brought his planners
سو
to a policy meeting, a policy group meeting,
and they were explaining the concept and my
questioning was such that Allen Dulles pleaded
with me not to spoil the plan at an early

about it when it was surfaced with the inner

Americans, but I'm not certain that there were.

O'BRIEN: Did you question the kind of intelligence that
was coming out about Cuba and the expected
reaction to Castro in general?
LANSDALE: Just in very general terms. : I didn't have
enough concrete and specific information
myself that was separate from theirs. Most
of the intelligence take at the time, avail-
able inside the U.S. government, was pretty
colored with this dissatisfaction and state-
ments of it. So I had no real way of
determining the accuracy or inaccuracy of it.
Some of the adjectives used in describing this
in briefings to us alerted me a little bit.

advisor on this thing? (That
hat was my staff job) job),
and I told him to be certain to get the JCS
to give it a real hard scrutiny and to come
-11-
up with details of whether it could succeed
or not. That was my last advisory role with
him. I was taken off advising on the project
after that, actually by my own request because
I was apparently causing too much trouble and
rks of progress.
's the reaction of the Joint Chiefs, people
like Lemnitzer, towards this? Is there an
institutional rivalry or bureaucratic rivalry
here in their minds?
LANSDALE: Somewhat, somewhat I was a little bit as
O'BRIEN:
though, well, somebody's going to be playing

Boy Scouts, so this isn't really rivalry.

They had. a difficult time taking this really.
seriously. Later, I know, when the JCS got
and helped
in on the actual planning of this, they became
much more serious on it because they had a
share of it.
:
Well, do you get involved in the informing
of McNamara and Gilpatric about this? Do you
get any way of sensing what their reactions
are on first being informed?
LANSDALE: No. They had apparently known by the time I
-12-
met them, I didn't get in on that. The one
person who has a view of their reactions
would probably be Bill Bundy, (William P.
A
Bundy) who I know at the time was discussing
this with them.-
O'BRIEN: Did you have
his fo

at that point?
LANSDALE: Yes This was a little out of Bundy's field.

He was always trying to figure out what the
chances were, the percentages of win or losso

He was low and I hadn't known the final plan

but they'd sure know a military landing, whether
it would succeed or not. Given some of the

they had given it a high chance of success,

how better the President could be served in
the policy decisions and arriving at them.
The thing was right at that moment, McNamara
had previously asked me for the same thing,
and I had come up with a proposal for him
which he put to Kennedy. I just told them?
Well I had some ideas but I had given them
to somebody else, and I was skeptical of the

would say on things and plague me with many
questions.
O'BRIEN: How were his questions? Was he fairly naive
about the problems?

LANSDALE: Now, this was was on problems questions of how the
government would operate at a decision level,

and they weren't naive at all. He had a very

and in the White House?
-18-
LANSDALE: It was a traumatic experience at top levels throughout
of the government. I think it affected
President Kennedy more than any other single
A
thing. It was almost a taboo subject if you
were going in to do business and to get an
approvm something over even hinted
Such
Phan juba
:
vuban affair. It was an
intensefully sore subject among all of these
people. I felt that almost all of the key
executives in the administration must have
Λ
dreamt about it at night or something, and
during the daytime working hours they just
even
didn't even want to contemplate it. And yet
و
they were honest enough people that they knew
they had to face up and look at it and would do
so, but it was an extremely emotional subject
with them, very much so.
O'BRIEN: Well, in terms of the Agency, there's a number.
of programs and, of course,involvements in
operations that they have. Do you see any
shift in these, any attempt on the part of the
Defense Department to move into some of these
:
areas which they felt were traditionally theirs

rather than the Agency. I guess what I'm
trying to say is, can you see any decline in

in decisions?

t
and
LANSDALE: Yes, I think so. I'm not certain that it was
well
the military as such. It might have been the
A
Ike McNamara personally
s encouragement of some of the military who
were somewhat interested but wouldn't really
have expressed the interest unless they were
directly asked, and there always had been some
feeling of unease I ease I think would be the best
word to describe it it-among the military about
type of
any clandestine, operations. They felt that
--

:
:
once it got over into guerrilla type of operations
or anything that would involve a military subject,
that it would be far better to let the military
establishment of the U.S. handle it. "But that
A
بو
K
would be sort of a dinner-coctail party type of
a gambit on their part, rather than sitting and
planning and so on of "We must grab some of
thet
this," Even though among themselves they talked
that way. They didn't express it in terms of
their attendence at policy councils or even in
-20-
talks with people like the Secretary of Defense
or the civilian, executive side of Defense." on
Λ
this, I think that McNamara himself probably

him from the JCS, and the Chiefs, and from the
intelligence community, the military intelligence

Agency) got its great start under McNamara,and

that the Bay of Pigs and the misreading of the
temper of the people in Cuba gave McNamara

great impetus in setting that up initially..

:
Do you ever take this question up, or is this
question ever raised in the administration by the
civilian people in DOD (Department of Defense]
or the White House, with you?
LANSDALE: Not with me. No. My theme on overseas operations
was reiterated enough so that it was known by
و
a number of people, and I always felt that it was
more efficient and effective to have a very
small group working and to choose them with very
always
-23-
great selectivity and go for a handful of
highly qualified people rather than a large
group of Americans charging overseas someplace.
This went for intelligence as well as diplomatic -
and other economic work, and so on. I used to
point out the embassies--for example, behind
the Iron Curtain--that would get dessimated by

O'BRIEN: Does the fact that you get this reputation,
of
mainly out the writings of guys like [Eugene]
Burdick and Graham Greene, does this affect you
in any way in your relations with the bureau-
:
cracy?
LANSDALE: Yes. It made life rather difficult. With
that
much of the work, I had to do in Washington,
I came back from a lot of operations abroad
and went up into policy-forming levels in
-24-
Washington almost immediately, and into facing
people who were very sensitive on my presence
abroad initially. Since I didn't just stick
يو
in a regular military category but would get
over into their own subject matter, this made
them very uncomfortables and I can understand
it while it happened, but it was carried to
too great an emotional length. At times I
would suggest certain individuals be sent to
look into a situation in a given country and
would arrange their transportation and so on
and I would get backing throughout the U.S.
government for this things and have an individual
approved by the Secretary of State as well as
Defense and up at the White House and so on,
but would set up a means of communicating
back so that we would get reports back. There
would be times when these individuals would
show up in a country, and the first time they
sent a message to me, the ambassador would
✓
ask them kindly to leave the country, to get
out of there, just because of my name. I was.
wasn
apparently the en

to some of these
-25-
people. One of my assistants was traveling
between Thailand and Saigon, and there was a
يو
coup going on in Saigon at the time and his

flight--in Phnom Penh, in Cambodia, and the

military attaché very kindly picked up this
guy and several other Americans from the
plane and found a place for them to stay
until they could get another flight out of
Phnom Penh. He asked this lad of mine where

he'd worked, and he said, "In the Pentagon)"--
he was a civilian employee--and he mentioned
that he worked for me, and the attaché got
all excited, called the ambassador, and he
was given two hours to come out of the country.
(Laughter) All he was doing was looking for
a place to sleep at night, so it became very
emotional and very silly, and detrimental to

the U.S. For example, once in Indonesia, in
meeting our folks around the embassy in

two Americans, who were not only best known
by the Indonesians but were respected, and

there was an affection there, and I have, told

the ambassador at the time, afterwards, make

real use of these people the Indonesians

the U.S., but they make an exception to these

two and they're just invaluable-but luable but the army

man was extremely close to the general staff
of the Indonesian army. I went on some visits
to members at their homes of the Indonesian General
staff, and this lad who was tall and blond--

a Nordic type, if you will--would go in, and
the small brown Indonesians (would and their

I suggested that we get the State Defense

a lieutenant colonel over and just let him
stay a week or so. He'd go right in and
talk to his old friends, and they'd probably
tell him what the Soviets were up to. He

took him out and showed him these sights
and
asked him what he thought of them and so on
the first day he was there. That night he

asked the ambassador to send it to me, at

That was Jones, yes
And he said, "Well,

asked the Department of State, to please let
Jones know that you're sponsoring this guy,

So they told Jones just to sit back

We have some wonderful Americans, and this
was what I was trying to do:wés wes to find out
which Americans have not only our interests
at heart but were enough interested in foreign
comics to be understand and have

really would be serving the best
interests of other countries in things. I'd
far rather see one man get in on something
like that than send a whole team in with all
sorts of things Pa
and sort of aggravate a
ratter
situation, than do something rather simple.
O'BRIEN:
Almost sensitivity training
LANSDALE:
RANSDATE: Incidentally, along these lines,
I've got a good story for your account.
O'BRIEN:
Great.
LANSDALE:
About the time of the Cuban Missile frisis,
McNamara came back from a meeting at the
White House one day and asked me to provide
the means for President Kennedy to talk to
the Cuban people on TV TV How the hell did I
و
know how to do that? He told me that he
wanted to do it within the next twenty-four
-29-
hours.
Well, it didn't happen. I suspected
that it, would take longer than that; I don't
know how you intrude on a TV V station's stations

broadcasting and get the people in the
950
country to go immediately to their TV sets
