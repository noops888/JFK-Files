MIRROR
1. On 14 December 1970, the undersigned visited WUSHARP
at the latter's request and had the following discussion,
WUSHARP asked whether we could use. WUSLAB/1 as a means of
contacting Cuban officials for the purpose of establishing
lties which could later be exploited by WUSHARP assets.:
I explained to WUSHARP that WUSLAB/1 had been instructed
to adopt a passive role in relationship to his Cuban
contacts, and to respond only to contact initiated by the
Cubans. WUSHARP stated that they understand our point of view
thoroughly.
2. At this meeting I briefed WUSHARP on the telephone
call from a DGI representative cited in reference. I told
WUSHARP that I would give them a memorandum on this as well
as a copy of the PCQ on Rogelio Rodriguez Lopez (201-332665)
in which they expressed definite interest.
