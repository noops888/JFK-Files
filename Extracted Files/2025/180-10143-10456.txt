1. Memo dated 24 Oct 1962 to Chief, Contact Division, from Chief, San
Francisco Office
Subject: Suitability of Manuel Ray and Miro Cardona for Important
Roles in a Possible New Cuban Government

Information received from De Robert North Professor of Political Science
at Stanford. University and long-time source of exceptional value. North
visited in Miami and contacted about 25 former Castro supporters representing
a broad political gam√∫t. Lor North got the impression from many of the
Cubans that they suspected Ray of being a "possible Communist sleeper".
North reluctant to pass along this information, because accusations were
very broad.
2. Mafomation report dated 16 July 1962 and Earlier
Source: Cuban National (Alien File #A-12570921) who asked for an
interview on occasion of first contact with CIA.
Cannot vouch for his bona fides. Had credential indicating membership in
branch of revolutionary army's intelligence service, now in exile in U.S.
and maintaing connections with colleagues in that country.

A friend of his reports plans to assassinate top Castro leadership in Cuba.
To be done by poison -- "Clostridium Botulinum" which is strong, odorless,
and tasteless. Takes about 12 days to kill. About 5cc would do the job.
Waiting for next visit of major delegation from a Communist country --
dinner in honor of the occasion should bring together most of the important
members of the regime and that is when the attempt will be made.

2. Cable dated Oct. 3, 1961 WA CITE NYOR 4902 Support (Travis) info L/A
Source is Ernesto Dezaldo
Branch from Daniels.
Cuban lawyer now
living in New York City. Stated the MRP in Havana is far less radical than
under the leadership of Ray, who has been completely discredited in recent
months. Primary purpose today is (a) assassination of top leaders in Castro
regime and (B) sabotage of important industrial and government installations
in Havana.
Strength of MRP in Havana estimated to exceed 1,000 - measured
more in terms of fund raising ability and blowing up of buildings.
3. Information dated June 4, 1961, Subject: Underground Student Leader
Comments on Post-invasion Cuba. Reporting officer talked with
ISIDRO BORJA, on the leaders of BRE. Borja says top DRE members in jail
or in a friendly embassy in Havana but said new leaders have been selected
and will resume sabotage activities shortly. Thought the underground could
restore tension in Cuba in 3-4 months. However, said outside help needed
to get rid of Castro. Claimed that prior to invasion, is was possible to
buy almost anything in Cuba from Castro officials they were tainted by
corruption. Since Castro's victory at Bay of Pigs, his popular support is
estimated to be around 80-85%. Most support is out of fear because the
people believe he will be in power permanently. Borja said DRE outside of
Cuba working hard for release of former leader, Alberto Muller from prison.

4. Memo to Acting Chief, Contact Division dtd 20 May 1964
From: Chief, Miami Field Office

Subject: Alleged "New York Times" Publicity Build-up for Manolo Ray

Hal Hendrix, Scripps-Howard L.A. correspondent believes NY Times publicity
buildup for Ray in full swing. Tad Szulc reporting Ray's war movements from
Miami. Also with Szulc is close friend, Henry Raymont of the Times.
Hendrix said Times playing up Ray while downplaying Artime and Gutierrez
Menoyo. Think's Times exaggerating Ray's plans to take teams of highly
trained guerrillas into Cuba, and that Ray's "war" is little more than an
MGM-type New York Times production so far.

1. Cable suggests that an offer of financial assistance to Ray's wife
and children from CIA rather than through the FRD may pay large future
dividends. Family to arrive circa September 1960.
2. Cable to Director
From: MASH
19 September 1960
Increasing suspicion RAUL CHIBAS a Castro plant. Since exfiltration by
KAPPES, CHIBAS has laid low but back in picture as representative of RAY.
Common knowledge that CHIBAS brought KAPPES out of Cuba, but should be
noted that KAPPES has since been in and out of Cuba three times with
no apparent difficulties.
CHIBAS sources of information:
Mason in U. S. government
Manuel de Jesus and Bender as FRD representatives
Nino Diaz as Alianza representative
Don Hogan Kappes as Alberto Fernandez representative.
This should get a good picture of the U.S. anti-Castro activities.
3. Summer 1960. Ray very actively recruited to become FRD member.
CHA considered him an important political asset. RAULCHIBAS, Ray's
assistant, spoke for him with U.S. authorities. Urged strong organization
inside Cuba before outside help could be effective. CHIBAS meets with
Bender 9/7/60, says he is in favor of FRD but completely committed to
Ray and would check with him.

Memo to Western Hemisphere/4 Chief
From: Rudolph E. Gomez, Acting Chief, WH
Subject: Approval from State to Include Manuel Ray Rivero in the

At a 20 September 1960 meeting, Ray's name was suggested for inclusion
in FRD and State desired to look further into his background. Ray was
discussed again on 9/27/60 with Mr. Divine who further conferred with
Ambassador Mallory same day and Mallory approved Ray's inclusion.
5. September 29, 1960 cable from MASH to WH9 indicates MASH somewhat
doubtful about Ray's feelings toward U.S. and continued dealings with
this group needs further policy consideration.
