Dear Joseph,
Please accept my appreciation for an assignment
well done as a member of the FY 1978 GS-07 Secretarial/
Clerical DO Personnel Evaluation Boards from 17 April
through 19 May 1978.
I well recognize the complexities involved in the
comparative evaluation of 560 clerical carcerists
a task further complicated by this being only the second
year it has been undertaken. Your deliberations were
vital to the Directorate's determination to bring to this
group of valuable employees the advantages of the merit
system.
Full-time service with the Evaluation Boards
represents a major contribution to the Directorate's
program of personnel assessment and management.
only were your promotion recommendations valued, but
recommendations for career development and training
were also extremely helpful.
I believe that your service on the Board broadened
and sharpened your own focus on personnel aspects of
Agency management. Too, I think that the time spent
in this endeavor could only have made you better aware
of our need for complete, careful and candidly written
appraisals of our employees.
Sincerely,
John N. McMahon
Deputy Director for Operations

12 years as a field-case officer in Mexico, Nicaragua and Brazil as well
as tours an Headquarters in LA Division and currently on the Cl Staff. He

number si Cl projects, including "a sensitive, multi-level project which
has resched in a neutralization of some Soviet espionage activity abroad, "
He also was called upon to support Cl activities requiring extensive travel
abroad in support of joint Agency and FBI objectives and "he executed these
assignments with a singular degree of professionalism. He recently also
organizež and ran in Spanish a Cl course for foreign liaison and the Station
involved described the effort "an an outstanding contribution." During the
previous mess report period he participated in two Cl surveys in Africa
and Lazz America and because of this experience he was recently named
to head arother Cl survey to take place in Latin America in the future.
3. is the view of the Fiscal Year 1978 GS-13 DO Personnel

SUBJECT
: Acknowledgment of Evaluation Board Functional Category
: Evaluation Board Precepts for Your Grade
REFERENCE
1. Based upon an examination of your past assignments and duties,
and after considering likely future assignments, you have been placed
(subject to your signature below) in the functional category/OS
Evaluation Board purposes. Precise definitions of this category are
contained in the Ivaluation Board precepts for your grade. This place-
ment is made in order that your performance, growth potential, and
career planning may be judged against officers similarly placed pro-
fessionally. YOU ARE URGED TO STAY THE PRECEPTS AND CONSIDER YOUR OWN
CASE CAREFULLY.
2. In general, you should consider the following;
a.
Categories are sharply defined. Competition
is within categories, not between them. Thus,
a weak B/OG performance is not strengthened
by reclassifying it as B/OS.
b. A change in category after sustained performance
in a different category may cause a temporary
loss of momentum in your career advancement
until you have demonstrated proficiency in your
new assignment.
c.
A category change should not be initiated for
the period of a temporary, training or rotational
assignment unless a permanent change of career
track will follow.
3. If you believe that this is not the correct category for
you because the substantive nature of your job more closely approxi-
mates another category or because you have made a permanent change
of career track, please take the matter up through your command channel
to secure the concurrence of your component of assignment or of your
home base component, as appropriate, to a change of your category.
Previously assigned and acknowledged categories will remain in effect
until a fully executed acknowledgment of change is received by the
Career Management Staff.
4. Please sign and date this notification in the space provided
and return it to your Personnel Evaluation and Management Officer or to
your Personnel Officer.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:
Liaison officials join station in extending appreciation
to Joseph Piccolo for his outstanding contribution to the
current task of moulding the KDSLEUTHS into an effective
counterintelligence organization.
Their high degree of enthusiasm was matched only by the
professional way in which they prepared their instruction
material, the ingenuity of their delivery, and above all the
high impact that they had on the students and their superiors.
Wish to complement the above two colleagues for a job
well done and for having upheld in their own respective
fields the high standards and prestige of the Agency in our
eyes and in those of our liaison counterparts.
Request that a copy of this cable be placed in their
respective personnel files.

Request for Change of Career Designation
to B/OS-Operational Specialist from B/OG-
Operational Generalist
1. It is requested that my career designation be changed
to B/OS-Operational Specialist from that of B/OG-Operational
Generalist. It is believed that the career activities and
recent events described below clearly meet the criteria set
forth in the Career Service Personnel Evaluation System Hand-
book,
2. In July 1977, I changed my home base from Latin
America Division to the Counterintelligence Staff.
This
change of home base was precipitated by the cancellation of a
planned overseas tour in Latin America which was scheduled to
begin in July 1977. The cancellation of the tour was caused
by State Department objections to my assignment because of
publicity accorded me by Philip Agee and Counterspy Magazine.

2. Although such designation under present statutes is viewed favorably by most persons,
the regulation governing this retirement system gives the individual the right to appeal such
a determination if he deems the designation adverse to his best interests. In order that this
technical requirement may be satisfied, you are hereby notified of your right to appeal. An
appeal with reasons therefore must be received in Headquarters within 60 days of the date of
this memorandum or acceptance of designation will be assumed. Any questions that you may
have in connection with your designation that cannot be answered by referring to referenced
Book Dispatch should be forwarded to Headquarters.
3. We believe that the benefits of the Organization Retirement System are superior to the
benefits of the Civil Service Retirement System. However, there are a few situations in which
an employee at the time of retirement may have so many years of service (almost 37) that he
would receive a higher annuity under the Civil Service System. Because of this, the policy
decision has been made that a participant in the Organization System who would receive a
higher annuity under the Civil Service System may, not later than one year prior to his retire-
ment, apply to be removed from our system and transferred to the Civil Service System. Thus,
you should not anticipate this contingency as a factor in deciding whether you regard your
designation as a participant adverse to your best interests.
