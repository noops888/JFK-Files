Number of releases of previously postponed information: 8

April 18, 1978
The Honorable Frank Thompson, Jr.
Chairman
Committee on House Administration
House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515
Dear Mr. Chairman:
I have approved a salary increase of $1,980.00 per year
effective April 1, 1978 for Louis Parisi, a staff investigator
for the Select Committee.
As Mr. Parisi's basic salary and benefits are paid by
the New Jersey State Police, his additional salary from the
House is paid in the form of a monthly expense allowance per
prior agreement with your staff and the Clerk of the House.
This was to avoid Mr. Parisi from earning retirement benefits
from both the Federal Government and the State of New Jersey.
Accordingly, Mr. Parisi's monthly expense allowance will
increase from $625.00 to $790.00 effective April 1, 1978.

Sincerely,
LOUIS STOKES
Chairman
TO: Thomas Howarth, Budget Officer

and Ida Jane Ross seven percent (7%) effective
April 1, 1978.

Washington, D.C. 20515
Dear Mr. Chairman:
The Select Committee on Assassinations has hired
Mr. Louis Parisi as a staff investigator at an annual
salary of $28,000.
In order to protect Mr. Parisi's pension and other
benefits with the New Jersey State Police, he will be
carried on the State's payroll while he is assigned to
the Select Committee.
New Jersey will bill the Committee at an annual
rate of $20,764 so that Mr. Parisi's stipend from The
House of Representatives will be $7,236.
Mr. Parisi will be working full time for the Select
Committee and will perform only those duties assigned
by the Committee.
