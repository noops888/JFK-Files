1. A liaison service in Venezuela has informed our
representatives in Caracas that Subject was arrested/11-18-65
in Caracas
on his arrival from Miami, Florida, and is being held by the
Venezuelan authorities. The liaison service told our Caracas
representatives that Subject was in Venezuela to assassinate an
unknown target for 15,000.
2. The liaison service added that there is insufficient
evidence to prosecute Subject and asked whether the Federal Bureau of
Investigation or The Immigration and Naturalization Service had any
interest in Subject. The liaison service's intentions are to
convert Subject to Miami if there is FBI or INS interest. Otherwise
they will release Subject on condition he leaves Venezuela.
