2. During the meeting the matters covered on the
previous day with the Chief of state were reviewed and the
specific action to be taxen was indicated with agreement on
the following points:
:
24
A. Special treatment should be given to the Caro
Astatigo" and the "Chao Hombres Banas which
involved Lyon SOSA Luls Augusto TURCIOS Lima06
06 Manuel JOUE Ortega Paz, and one (inu) (lmu) whom
wo will be able to identify if shown a photograph. Every
effort should be made to identify the last-named person
and then to recrutt all four of them. Meanwhile, all
Information available concerning them should bo
collected and furnished to the station for forwarding/6-2
to ileadquarters. The object in each of these cases
should be to achieve contacts with them for the purpose
of effecting recruitments. Il required, we will have
a Cuban who knows the individuals and whom they
believe to be be a Cuban Litelligence officer go to
(6-2 Guatemala for the purpose of contacting them under
controlled conditions which will permit us to monitor
the conversation during the time that he poses a
still active in Cuban Intelligence. Following this,
the recruitment attempt would be made in each caso
possibly by one of our officers if the circumstances
at the time indicate that this procedure would be
most likely to be a success.
B. Without waiting for the outcome of effort to
recruit the four individuals described above, the 24
Guatemalan government) should bend every effort
to locate all those individuals (possibly as many
as 200) who have received guerrilla warfare training
in Cuba, and to arrest them. Maximum publicity
should be given to the arrests once they have been
questioned. Hopefully declarations will be made
by some of them which will assist in effective
propaganda use of their arrest and their
involvement in subversion on behalf of the Castro
government. They should be interviewed separ-
ately and, if possible, some with greater potential
should be doubled so that they may serve to keep
us informed of plans for subversion in the future.
11
C. The Quatemalans) should keep us advised at
every stage of the progress made in the cases so
that we may lend assistance when appropriate.
