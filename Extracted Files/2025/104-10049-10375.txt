SPECIFIC PAWLEY Business Interests in the Dominican Republic
ACTION REQUIRED: For info only.
1. In addition to minerals exploitation in which Mr. William
D. PAWLEY has substantial investments, negotiations are being concluded
for the purchase by PAWLEY of the Hotel Hamaca in Boca Chica, a resort
town near the almost-completed new international airport, about 30 km
east of Ciudad Trujillo.
2. Another activity which is kept very much under wraps is the
concession granted PAWLEY for procurement and world-wide sale of all
new issues of Dominican postage stamps. This activity is managed by
Edward P. PAWLEY, brother of William, whose office is in the Dominican
post office building.

3. The source (considered sensitive) of the information in para-
graph 2. is Mrs. Nora BRITZIUS, a U. S. citizen employed by PAWLEY Wow,
in the stamp business. The source volunteered the information on a
very confidential basis to Helene I. DAHLERUP at a social gathering.
