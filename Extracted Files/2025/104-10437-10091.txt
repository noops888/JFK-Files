1. Forwarded under separate cover is the up-dated Target Study
on Jesus CRUZ Gonzalez, the Cuban Press Attache in Mexico, and his
wife, Mercedes MARTINEZ Moreno, Secretary to the Ambassador and Chargé.
As is clear from the attached study and the log of activities of CRUZ
during October 1970, CRUZ is extremely busy, has many contacts, and is
probably one of the more accessible members of the Cuban Embassy. On
the other hand, he is so busy with his overt activities working with
press matters, and handling the Cuban Embassy side of Prensa Latina, that
the Station does not believe he has practically any time free for intelli-
gence assignments. (Since the arrival of the Cultural Attache in
January 1970, CRUZ has dropped all cultural activities. He no longer
handles the Mexican-Cuban Cultural Institute.) He is on the phone with
or visiting the Prensa Latina offices several times each day. He
arranges for subscriptions to publications (magazines and newspapers)
through Prensa Latina from the United States and Latin American countries
and he orders books from various bookstores in Mexico City. He also
handles the press material, including news film, coming to Mexico via
commercial flights from the Prensa Latina representative in Peru. He
orders photographic and other related supplies in Mexico and New York,
and handles visas for newsmen who wish to travel to Cuba. Mercedes does
lot to help CRUZ, as he does not have his own secretary. As can be seen
from the attached log, twice he dictated a cable over the phone for her ta
type for his signature. It is believed that when she returns in the
afternoon to the Embassy with CRUZ it is to help him.

2. The LIEMBRACES have surveilled CRUZ quite often, and only one
unusual contact was noted That was a three hour luncheon with an
<Argentine leftist, Maximo SIMPSON Grinberg, a foreign correspondent
in Mexico for the magazine Medico Moderno. Generally speaking, CRUZ
leaves the Embassy during the working day alone on his errands, rather
than with another Embassy employee, which is more often the rule with
the other officers. CRUZ usually goes with his wife on errands during
the lunch hour or in the afternoon before returning to the Embassy.
These errands are on personal business such as to the furniture store,
super market, optics, doctor, etc; but also on business, such as to
bookstores. CRUZ' days are very long, as can be seen from the attached
log.
3. While Mercedes and CRUZ are very busy and have many contacts, they
do not seem to make close personal friends, and the persons with whom they
are in contact appear almost exclusively to be business contacts. The
Station has been unable to locate any person who might make a good access
agent to CRUZ. None of the Station's agents mentioned in paragraph 6 of
HMMA-38920 were close to CRUZ. The closest companion would be the Subject
of 201-860095. The Station is reporting separately on its attempts to
develop and recruit this person.
4. The Station has even considered approaching CRUZ' maid,
especially when it became known she was so unhappy with her lot as a
servant. However, since the maid almost never leaves the apartment and
she is virtually inaccessible, the Station has been unsuccessful in
having any asset establish any degree of rapport with her, although a
contact of LITAINT-2 has been able to engage her in telephone contact
and hopes to date her eventually.
5. Since the Station believes that CRUZ is almost entirely
dedicated to press affairs, and no really good access agents are in
view, the Station will not make a priority effort to develop an entre into
CRUZ' circle except via the operation now underway to recruit 201-860095.
If this operation is successful, the Station would have an excellent asset
in frequent contact with CRUZ for a better personal assessment and
information on CRUZ' assignment in Nexico for the Cubans. Until this.
type of information becomes available, however, the Station believes it
has identified CRUZ' role as almost purely press, and we have been unable
to detect any vulnerability data on either CRUZ or his wife.

Mercedes said in 1968 that her Mother and Father
were the only family she had in Cuba. (Note:
It was impossible to interpret whether she meant part
of her family was outside Cuba, or this was all there
was to the family.)
LISAMPAN/BAKER: reported in 1968 that Mercedes said
she had sent her nephew "Robertico" a pair of stockings.

13.
Religion:
UFAA 603, Source Jesus' sister, said that Cruz' family
is large and all are devout Catholics. Nine members
are priests or nuns. Until 1956 Jesus CRUZ was a
student at La Salle Seminary. An aunt on the father's
side was the Mother Superior of a convent in Cuba,
and is now in a convent in Spain.
Mercedes:
No indication Mercedes is Catholic nor
agnostic. In March 1968 she said she didn't think
the Soviets should have held a reception of the Soviet
poet Yevshenko in view of the death of the Soviet
astronaut GAGARIN a few days before.
Education:
Jesus: UFAA 603. Was a student at La Salle Seminary
in Havana from 1946 to 1956 studying to be priest.
Left in 1956 to attend high school. He was graduated
in 1957.
Mercedes: Said she did not study either at secundaria
or preparatoria. (This means no high school education.)
Instead she said she studied some commercial courses.
(Note: She is a good secretary, and takes shorthand
and types. Source: LISAMPAN/BAKER.)

Languages:
Jesus: speaks some French (was stationed in Paris)

Mercedes: speaks some French and some English.
She thinks the English has been useful, but Jesus
apparently refuses to learn English and has chided
Mercedes about her having studied it. Mercedes is proud
of her French and likes to correct people's pronunciation
of French words. She says that when she speaks a lot
of English it is hard for her to express herself in
French. She has no trouble translating either French
or English. She studied English for 5 years.
(LISAMPAN/BAKER) (Source: Sation appraisal of
Mercedes' English is that it is only fair.)

ΗΜΜΑ 36071 reported Mercedes said she was

LISAMPAN/BAKER reported on 21 August 1968 that
Mercedes said she was separated from Jesus for
9 months while he was in Europe, serving in Prague.
Said
LISAMPAN/BAKER, 1968, Mercedes said that Mexico
was colder than Paris, and later Prague.
she arrived in Prague in full winter.
1965-1967:
Jesus was in Cuba working for the Foreign
Ministry (Source: Digna, the sister. Digna,
however, was wrong about the dates of Jesus' assign-
ment in Paris which she gave as late 1962 to
late 1965) (Note: Possibly he was in Prague 1964-65.)
Mercedes may have worked in the Cuban Foreign
Ministry during the same period. ΗΜΜΑ 35071 reported
she worked in the "Direccion" with a girl who was
going to marry Pedro LLOPIS Salles, a courier.
LISAMPAN/BAKER reported on 8 August 1968 that Mercedes
made reference to the fact she worked in the "Ministry".
LISAMPAN/BAKER reported in November 1968 that
Mercedes gave instructions on typing of "Confi-
dential" correspondence. She said one copy goes
to Raul ROA (Foreign Minister). She said, "Don't
forget, I worked within the Secretary". ΗΜΜΑ 36071.
20 November 1967 CRUZ arrived PCS in Mexico as Press

B. Curriculum Vitae (Chronologically by year from birth
to present.)
Jesus' youth was that of a normal middle class Cuban.
The father had a small farm and from the profits gave his
family a comfortable life. They were not, however, rich
or from the upper crust of the social ladder. Jesus'
sister said "we had everything we needed. We were middle
class Cubans, not rich, but not poor." Jesus was a student.
during the Batista era before Castro. He did not have to
work; he just asked father for his expense money. Sister
thinks Mercedes was from a middle class family. (UFAA 2430,
22 October 1970)
Apparently in Havana, then Paris, Havana, Mexico City.
See Job history. Some question whether they went to
Prague, when, why, and for how long, possibly this was
after Paris.

Nature and description of lodging and surroundings:
a) previous apartment in Mexico City was only one
bedroom apartment. They lived there during their
first tour until Mercedes went home to have her third
baby. In January 1969 she said that when she returned
from Cuba she would seek new quarters. Her apartment
was uncomfortable and she couldn't receive people there,
they always had to eat out. Mercedes indicated to a
Embassy officer she would not ask for authorization from
Havana first as she might be turned down, then she would
not be allowed to move.
She indicated she brought from Recuperación de Bienes
a dining room and living room furniture. She bought
in Mexico her beds, and a refrigerator out of her own
salary. She thought she fared worse than other employees.
b) In early 1970 they rented their present apartment,
which has three bedrooms and two baths, plus a maid's
bedroom and bath. Living room, kitchen, dining room.
3. Location of resident, with respect to target installation:
15 blocks almost directly East from the Embassy.
4. Servants:

Clara Santa, Cuban, negro.
is in Mexico as part of Cruz' household. Born about

Has special Cuban passport and
In 1968 the Felix LUNA (201-759016) family also had
a Cuban maid which they brought with them when they
came PCS. That maid is no longer here. She was also
negro.
July 1968 Carlota, the other maid, said she saw the
records, and they were to get 1,000 pesos salary.
But deductions were to be made for food, etc. In mid-
1968 both Carlota and Clara Santa each got 500 pesos
(U.S. $40) per month.

promptly, but she is a stingy mistress, and deducts
from Clara Santa's salary every cent paid for the
maid's medicines, etc.
It is known that the Cuban government gives some
money to Clara Santa's mother in Cuba. How much
is not known. Clara Santa wanted to ask for a part
of her mother's money in Mexico to help buy shoes,
clothes, etc. to take back to Cuba, but she was told
this was a capitalistic approach.
Mercedes, though strict, is good about sending
packages of medicines back to Cuba for Clara.
Clara is apparently very color conscious. Always asks
what color a person is. She says the Mexicans like
Negro women, therefore she had to be careful. (Note:
It is possible Mercedes told her this to keep her home,
as this was insinuated once.) Mercedes does not like
for Clara Santa to talk with people on the phone. The
other maid, Carlota, commented Mercedes treated Clara
like a child.
Clara's main complaint is that she has no free time, is
tied to the apartment, does not have time for the movies,
to get her hair done, etc. She also complains things
are expensive in Mexico. Likes to buy clothes. Mercedes
does help her with the washing and ironing. Mercedes
also helps by sending a lot of the laundry out, especially
that which needs ironing, like shirts. Compared to the
Luna's, the Cruz' do very little entertaining, thus
lightening Clara's work. ✓ de ZULUETA 10201
Daisy
22 September 1970: Daisy/called Santa re the farewell
party given for Mrs. Luna. Santa said that Mercedes
asked Santa if she wanted to go, but Santa felt she had
to tell Mercedes she was the one who should go.
and Santa criticize all the women who work at the
Embassy, saying they are a bunch of hypocrites. (Main
complaint seems to be the other women have money, buy
clothes, etc.) Santa said she would be glad when
December came as she can then return to Cuba (did not
say for vacation or PCS).

November 1970: Clara still seldom goes out. Her best
friend appears to be Daisy ZULUETA, also a negro.
Daisy does Clara's hair, sometimes shop together.
5.
Meals, where, when and with whom:
Jesus and Mercedes both generally return to the Embassy
after lunch. Lunch is often hurried at home. Comparatively
speaking they have few luncheon guests. Apparently they
often eat the evening meal out (in Mexico this is the
light meal of the day).
For an evening snack they often go to "El Farolita"
on the corner of Juanacatlan and Altata.
6. Barber:
Not known, but Cruz always appears neat.
Mercedes goes to the beauty shop quite often. She
keeps her hair dyed--black.
7.
Tailor:
Jesus: As of September 1968 Jesus had two suits.
He apparently brought one with him from Cuba. He had
one made in Mexico. Cost him over 1,000 pesos (U.S. $80)
When in Yucatan during 1968, both Cruz and Mercedes
bought a lot of things (LIFEAT implied in the clothes
line). When Cruz returned in July 1968 he bought a
lot of Guayaberas (typical Yucatecan sport shirts).

There is little indication Cruz and his wife go to
night clubs, cafes. On 15 August 1968 they did go
to CARDINI's, but this probably because a Cuban
singer was playing there.
17. Vacations:
Cruz and Mercedes do not appear to take vacations in
Mexico nor to travel much in Mexico on weekends.
Mercedes does, apparently, think it is important to
see the tourist sights as has told this to visiting
Cubans.
They also seldom go to Cuba. The whole family, including
maid, returned to Cuba for one month home leave in
January 1969, after having been in Mexico for 2 years..
Mercedes had not returned to Cuba in this time, nor had
the children.
She returned again with the children the end of
September 1969 to have her third baby. They all returned
to Mexico the end of January 1970.

Cruz and his wife do not seem to have close personal
friends. They seem to be colder, prefer to be alone,
and spend most of their time working or running family
errands. They do not even appear to develop close
freindships with their fellow employees. Mercedes
likes to gossip with the other employees, but her
friendship appears to stop there. Most of their contacts
appear to be in Cruz' line of work--press or cultural,
and are for business purposes.

23. Telephone contacts:
Cruz receives and makes many long distance phone calls
at his home. Calls came in from Havana, the Cuban
Mission in New York, and from cultural/press contacts
throughout Mexico. This was quite true during the
pre-Olympic season when the Cubans had many cultural
affairs (dance teams, art, etc.) circulating around
Mexico. Now the calls mainly concern press matters.
He calls the Cuban Missions in Canada and New York
re purchases they are making for him. Also calls Havana
and they call him at home.
24. Tobacco:
Mercedes used to smoke "KOOL" cigarettes when she
was in Paris.
As of November 1970 it does not appear either smoke now.
(LITAINT-2)
25. Alcohol:
March 1968 Mercedes said Cruz was drunk the previous
night. No more details. (LISAMPAN/BAKER).
LITAINT-2 reports Cruz cannot hold liquor, but insists
on drinking cognac. (November 1970) Gets drunk
occasionally.
26. Eating habits:
15 August 1968: Cuban maid said Mercedes and Cruz
eat very little ordinarily. They prepare barely
enough so nothing is left over, and a last minute guest
is a problem. Insinuation is that Mercedes is very
tight.

27.
Mode of transportation:
Cruz has and has always had a QP car in Mexico.
While he shares this with other Embassy officers
occasionally, it is usually his.
Cruz usually picks Mercedes up at home if she has to
do something or go to the Embassy late. But she also
quite often calls a cab to take her someplace.
she commented she had taken a bus.
Once
Mercedes took driving lessons in Mexico on May 1970,
and occasionally drives alone but not as much as the
other driving wives.
28. Chattel property:
Cubans provided Cruz with living and dining room
furniture, but in Mexico they bought their own beds,
and a refrigerator.
Bought a Phillips TV in Mexico.
Bought a company tablecloth June 1968.
Brought a vacuum from Cuba.
Mercedes commented she had a lovely bedspread in Cuba
and had to buy more here in Mexico.

No known bank accounts, but it is believed Mercedes
and Cruz are saving every cent they can and are investing
in things to take back to Cuba.

(Comments
February 1969: Cruz' two sisters and brother-in-law in Miami
believe Cruz is totally in favor of the current regime,
and nothing could induce him to defect or collaborate
with the U.S. One sister commented, however, that he
might have a favorable reaction if his parents got out
of Cuba. (Note: The sister was very emotional at this
point, and gave no reason why she thought Cruz would
change his mind.) UFAA 603
UFAA 1966:
Sister said Cruz is idealist, truly believes in
Castro. Convinced what he is doing is good for Cuba.
He is definitely a Fidelista, but not a Communist.
(LITAINT-2, November 1970)
