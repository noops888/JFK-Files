Summary
4. AMFAUNA-1 is a Cuban national who was recruited and trained in
the United States and returned legally to Cuba(in March 1961 to serve as 24
resident agent in Havana.) Since then he has built a net (of over twenty 24
sub-agents and has sent back 140 S/W messages, from which upwards of
fifty intelligence disseminations have been made. He is highly
motivated for his work and under effective control by JMWAVE. The
quality of his production is, for the most part, very good and improving
although he is at times distracted by an understandable interest in
para-military operations. Operationally he is very skillful; however,
he has been known to take unnecessary risks. There is no reason to
think that he is under hostile control nor that the operation is likely
in the future to be turned against us. There is, however, the real
risk that he may one day fall into a G-2 trap baited with the Escambray
guerrillas. If so, this will be due to the fact that contact with the
guerrillas was his first assignment and, although he has been re-
directed to intelligence collection, he sometimes seems to feel that
he has failed in his primary mission. This, plus the fact that he
evident believes that the end is now very close, is apt to make him.
Vulnerave to an appeal from the "heroes of the Escambr

skillful in the practice of security. He has built a false identity
which he uses wherever possible in his operational contacts, he is
usually selective and cautious in his choice of collaborators, he
takos pains to check on the security of his sub-agents, and he uses
a system of cutouts for much of his work.

but wherever possible he introduces himself to new contacts by the
name of "Julie ROJO"TE ROJO7Evidently he is now living the part of (Julio 07
ROJO to such an extent that he has in effect a double identity. In
one of his S/W messages he asked that the widow of AMCUSP-1 be warned
not to reveal that ("Julio") is in Cuba. Since AMFAUNA-1 is in Cuba

that she should not reveal that AMFAUNA-1 and ("Julio ROJO") are07.

7. In recruiting sub-agents, AMFAUNA-1 relies primarily on his
own judgment and intuition. If he approves of a person, he will
recruit him. However, he has shown himself to be very cautious in
granting his approval. He has reported two persons whom he does not
completely trust because, while otherwise well qualified, they drink.
too much and are indiscreet. For two other examples, AMBOA-1 and
LITAU-5 approached him separately and revealed their relationship with
KUBARK, hoping to collaborate with him; AMFAUNA-1 treated them both
with reserve while he checked them out with JMWAVE. He has submitted 04
the names of other contacts for checking. In the case of AMFAUNA-4, Go
whom he recruited without prior checking because time did not permit
it, he put his misgivings in writing: "Right away AMFAUNA-1 arranged
for a personal interview, taking utmost precautions, since we have
had sad previous experiences with members of CASTRO's armed forces."

an independent eye on the former's security. On more than one occasion
he has reported that one of his sub-agents is under G-2 surveillance,
and that for the time being he is staying away from him.

9. In general AMFAUNA-1 seems to trust in the efficiency of his
security precautions. On 25 February 1962 he reported that Identity
11 had been caught, but that he was in no danger because he had been
compartmented from her. This compartmentation is achieved by the use
of five cutouts: AMFAUNA-2, AMFAUNA-3, AMFAUNA-4 AMBOA-1, and
AMFAUNA 5, who maintain contact for AMFAUNA-1 with most if not all of
his sub-agents. Chart A, which shows AMFAUNA-1 in direct contact with
AMFAUNAS 7 through 13, may be in error on this point. It would be
more in keeping with AMFAUNA-1's known modus operandi for him to have
cutouts between himself and these sub-agents. If there is a cutout or
cutouts here, their identity is not yet known. There may also be an
unreported cutout between AMFAUNA-1 and AMFAUNA-4.

AMFAUNA-1 has not been explicit on this point, but it is
believed that he shares his favors between them. If so, he has the
best of cover for his relations with them. It also clarifies the
otherwise puzzling picture of a legal resident of Cuba sleeping in a
different bed each night. This practice must certainly reduce the
possibility that the C-2 will pick him up for routine questioning.
i
Communications:
11. The bulk of AMFAUNA-1's communications come via S/W. His
méssages to JMWAVE are sent to accommodation addresses serviced by
AMPAN-2 and AMCUTLER-1. JMWAVE's messages to him are addressed to
AMFAUNA-14. AMFAUNA-1 can also use(diplomatic couriers) for sending
documents and other material unsuitable for S/W. He has a personal
contact with two of the officers (of the Spanish Embassy who either

this agent, who has also been recruited independently by
JMWAVE, is uncertain. He first mentioned her in October

ly defected. AMFAUNA-1's last mention of her was on 15
November when he reported that she had given him a map show-
ing artillery installations on the south coast of Las Villas,
It is possible that AMFAUNA-1 has broken contact with her,
but since he has not reported having done so it is considered
1961 as his cutout to Identity-14, (a a Cubana Airlines Pilot)
more likely that she remains his cutout to two Cubana Airlines 08

(2) AMFAUNA-19: He was recruited at the same
time as AMFAUNA-18. Although AMFAUNA-1 did not
explicitly say so, it can be inferred that he and
AMFAUNA-18 are witting of each other's recruitment.

of people employed at Rancho Boyeros Airport).24It is believed
that the identities of all these people have not yet been
reported, but they seem to be effective. On 29 May 1962
AMFAUNA-1 reported the arrival of an undocumented Soviet plane
at Rancho Boyeros, and forwarded the passenger list which he
said one of his agents had obtained clandestinely. Following

that the two children have different matronymics, that neither of them
is his wife's last name, and that all three dependents have different
addresses. It is assumed that this is his third wife. Since AMFAUNA-1
has never mentioned her in any of his S/W correspondence, it is also
assumed that she has gone the way of her two predecessors.

added that his brother has no sexual relations with his sub-agents
except what is considered normal and acceptable by Cuban standards.
19. The elements of AMFAUNA-1's motivation, then, include an
adventurous spirit and a taste for clandestine work. Although "anti-
Communism" may be an overworked expression, it would seem to apply in
the case of AMFAUNA-1, gif his former membership in the Falange) and the
(German Intelligence Service)can be taken as indicators. Also included
should be the loss of a (freight forwarding business) which started out
promisingly in 1959 but folded up after a year of CASTRO's revolution-
ary government. Finally, although these factors did not yet exist
in January 1961 when he was recruited, AMFAUNA-1 is certainly affected
now by the death of AMCUSP-1 and the imprisonment of his father.)
Control
이
08
20。 It is evident from his S/W messages that AMFAUNA-1 derives
great personal satisfaction from his work against the CASTRO regime.
His connection with KUBARK provides him with the means to do this work.
This is believed to be a strong element of control. There have been
many opportunities to test this control, by ordering AMFAUNA-1 to do
something or to desist from doing something else, and the control is
believed to be effective.
Previous History of the Operation
January to May 1961:
21. AMFAUNA-1 was engaged in some form of clandestine work against
the CASTRO regime as early as (December 196009 As with so much else in
this operation, details are lacking, but it is known that he already
had an understanding with Identity-29 whom he had known for twenty
Vears.06 In December 1960, Identity-29 introduced AMFAUNA-1 to Identity-
27, Can MAR coordinator from Matanzas, who had been introduced to..
Identity-29 by one of the members of her group, Identity-28. Identity-

AMJAG-4, who at that time was heavily engaged in work with the
resistance groups. AMJAG-4 introduced them to a JMWAVE case officer
who instructed them to return to Cuba, to form contacts with as many
resistance groups as possible, and to report their progress through
CAMRUNG-1) who was JMWAVE's principal agent in the paramilitary field.

25. To support the activities of AMFAUNA-1, AMCUTLER-1) and
ACUSP-1 it was agreed that JMWAVE would deposit $1,000 monthly into
the local bank account of AMCUSP-1 and the latter would provide the
equivalent in Cuban pesos from hislown resources inside Cuba.
26. ARCUSP-1) and AMCUTLER-1) continued to busy themselves with
preparations for supporting the April invasion They contacted
salesmen for Identity-19 and also for Identity-20 who was intended to
be a radio operator for Identity-23. Although AMFAUNA-1 knew all
these people, he was compartmented from these operations to some
rextent, so that after the arrest of AMCUSP-1) and the escape of
Identity-21 who, at their request, provided cover as travelling drug 08

27. AMCUTLER-1) and AMFAUNA-1, working together, held meetings
with Identity-33, a Cuban Army oficer stationed at the (San Antonio delo
Los Banos base, e, and discussed plans for supporting the invasion.
AMFAUNA-1 also contacted Identity-35, the (commanding officer of the 06
San Julian base and arranged for its surrender, using Identity-34,"
head of the (OA in Pinar del Rio as a cutout. He had another agent
on the base, Identity 36, and had already recruited AMFAUNA-11, an

G-2 while holding a clandestine meeting. At first this was not
regarded as too serious a matter. The G-2 had broken into the meeting
only after having been alerted by the suspicious behavior of a woman ol
lookout, and it was believed ieved that they had no real evidence. AMCUTLER-1)
came to the JMWAVE area on (3 April 1961) and returned again to Cuba on
10 April still optimistic that AMCUSP-1) and AMRUNG-1) would either be
released or could be helped to escape. However, However, one of the other 201
prisoners apparently confessed and implicated AMCUSP-1) and AMRUNG-1, who
were executed on 20 April, with the wave of arrests accompanying the
April 17 invasion, AMCUTLER-1 took asylum in the Venezuelan (Venezuelan) Embassy and
AMFAUNA-1 went temporarily linto hiding.
29. On 27 April 1961 AMFAUNA-1 resumed operations by sending
Identities 24, 25, 26 and 27 to collect order of battle information
in Matanzas. Identities 26 and 27 returned to Havana to report.
Identity-25 remained in Matanzas, and Identity-24 was caught by the G-2.
30. In May 1961, Identity-30 informed AMFAUNA-1 that some kind of
conspiratorial activity was going on in the home of AMCOG-2. He
arranged to meet her through Identit: -30 whom he thereafter used as a
cutout to her.
