1. Elsie L. SCALETTI recalls that Raymond A. FRADYER, Chief of
the Cuban Section, tried to get Agee to discuss the development of contacts
with access to the Cuban target in the Olympics. In these discussions it may
well be that Agee was told about LIARM-1, a member of the Mexican rifle team,
who was a contact of the Station and we were trying to get invited to Cuba. 08
(LIARM-1 is no longer a contact of the Station even though he is still with the
rifle team.

2. SCALETTI recalls the Cuban Section feeling very frustrated that
Agee could provide no leads or assistance to this section in its effort to target
against the Cuban teams. She recalls no memoranda prepared by Agee for the
Section, no leads given the Section, and he came to discuss the olympics with
C/Cuba not more than half a dozen times.

3. As SCALETTI recalls, it is unlikely that Agee knew any thing about
the operations being run against the Cuban target than that which he might have
picked up at Headquarters or known about the Station operations in general --
such as audio, surveillance, photo surveillance, etc.

4. SCALETTI had Agee over to her home once for dinner; there were
no other guests. Agee had SCALETTI, her husband, and Laura J. UTSTINE ob
(on TDY) to his apartment once for dinner. The conversation was always
light. The only significant thing about Agee's plans which arose was his
discussion about buying used drycleaning equipment in the United States,
bringing it to Mexico and setting up a drycleaning plant. This was brought
up as something for the future and just an idea Phil was toying with.

5. SCALETTI ran into Agee by chance on the side street by the Embassy
one day after the arrival of John A. PROBERT. Agee said he understood
PROBERT had arrived as COS, and he would like to say hello. I suggested
he call PROBERT. I immediately informed PROBERT of my chance encounter
with Agee, and informed PROBERT that Agee had resigned under somewhat
of a cloud and suggested he get briefed himself on Agee's assignment in Mexico.

6. Agee knew that SCALETTI was in Mexico(under tourist cover,
even though SCALETTI was working regular hours in the Embassy. He
probably also knew that there were other Station employees also utilizing
tourist cover.
