Mr. Colby. I believe so, yes.
11
Yes. That is what our evidence says, the summary

available in 1963. And there have been some minor changes in
some of the details of this summary, very minor changes.

But the essence of this report is still roughly accurate, I

believe.

sent down to take this job. And he assumed as part of it the

Had he been the person who had, in
connection with the abortive effort to kill Mr. Lmumba,
hired an agent for that purpose?

Mr. Colby. I have forgotten whether hehired him. He
hired a foreigner. And this foreigner's job - our records
indicate that this foreigner's job was tied up with tled up with the pener
[tration of code rooms and the safe cracking and thing stof this
nature for that purpose. And there are some very obscure
references that an additional assignment was to look into the
possible assassination of Mr. Lmumba.
The evidence is
18
19
that he went down to what is now Kinshasa, Elizabethville in
1960, stayed there a few weeks, and left in October, I
20
21
believe. And then Mr. Lmumba was killed thereafter in a totally
separate set of circumstances in which we had nothing to do.
22
There is some indication that a CIA officer who was asked
23
24
to have something to do with this particular job said he did
not want to do it.

Mr. Colby. He retired at the end of December of last year.
He remained working for us for a few months. I think he is
retired. I think he is retired. I believe he is still in

Mr. Colby. That was the Angleton case, Mr. Chairman, and
the facts of that case were that I had had some professional
differences in the organization with Mr. Angleton as to the
way the counterintelligence business was run and the way the
Israeli account was handled. I believed that it required a
higher degree of coordination of the other elements of the
Directorate and of the Agency. We had debated this on various
occasions in the past. I did reorganize that staff in 1973 and
took a number of functions away from it. The liaison with the

set as my time limit for this discussion the end of December
because there were some very substantial retirement benefits
that people would loose if they stayed after that point. Then
unfortunately the Seymour Hirsh article of December 22nd came
to our attention before it was actually published, and so I
brought Mr. Angleton up and said that I was going to make two
basic decisions. I was going to move the Israeli account from
his control and I was going to put some sucessor leadership
into the Head of the Counterintelligence Staff.

I said I would
offer him a post of tying together some counterintelligence

you, Mr. Colby, before I forget it. You have made reference

handled under Mr. Angleton. Before we finish our review with
you of covert operations we would like to have a more detailed
statement of that matter

you in connection with it.

I just wanted to give you notice.

covert action but that is all right, no problem, I will cover

Mr. Harvey was given the responsibility of this by Mr.
Bissel and originally it continued as a separate action from
the Castro operation, but Mr. Harvey was also given that
responsibility, and for all intents and purposes they became
wedded.
Mr. Helms was the person who formally approved ZR Rifle
as a project. ZR Rifle had a dual purpose that has not been
clarified by our inquiry. It apparently was in fact used for
the stated purposes, as far as organizational activities want
along, which was to steal codes, and Mr. Helms, when he
approved the project, authorized accounting on certification,
which meant that rather than the usual vouchers supporting
expenditures, that the officer involved would simply certify
that the money had been spent and this would be accepted.
It had a project amount of some dollars, $7500 - $10,000.
some of it to include the salary of an agent, some to include
operating expenses.
So Mr. Helms' main appearance in the approval of ZR Rifle
does not necessarily equate with the date when he became
familiar with the Castro operation.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Mr. Colby, in connection with
song and the 1(B)
ZR Rifle, I think you testified or your associate said this was
a multi-purpose operation, including stealing codes, and the
development of the capability of what euphemistically is called
executive action.
In your professional judgment, and with your history of

your background in the Agency, does it make any sense to you that

10 the sort of stealing codes, which. I assume means from other (5)
governments would be mounted under the direction of a man
about whom all I know is that Mr. Harvey has a background of
something like a soldier of fortune, and funded at the level,
I should say, of $7500 to $10,000?
:
Does it not suggest to you thate stealing codes was in
1/3)
fact an internal cover for what was explicitly an assassination
operation with unlimited, non-voucher financial capability?
18
Mr. Colby. No, not that it is purely a cover.
1.9
In the first place, Mr. Harvey had a very successful tour
20
21
in Berlin where he ran the Berlin tunnel operation, which was
one of our major successful intelligence operations.
22
23
24
Mr. Harvey was a very colorful figure who had his lifestyle,
which is different than some others, but he had been very
effective at that, and vory adventuresome in that category 01 1
signals intelligence and a very venturesome idea of that nature.

1(B)
6 the breaking into of safes and things, all that complicated
7 material?
8
Now, the thing that puts it together with this "capability"
9 executive action, is the high degree of compartmentation of
10 this material, that kind of a project. In other words, a
11 code-breaking, a stealing operation, obviously that is to be
12 kept very, very secret. If you get caught in it, it has all
13 sorts of very bad diplomatic implications, and so forth.
1(B)
14 Therefore, there is a system of very sharp compartmentation of
15
16
the work of that particular group.
You also are dealing with some very venturesome people
17 who are willing to crawl into somebody else's code room and 18
18 take the chance of getting caught
19
20
So, given you have a man who had some good technical
experience, who is a venturesome type himself and is running a
21 program which is not too far off the requirements of high
compartmentation, and a very high risk kind of operation, and
therefore, for ir. Bissel to have selected Harvey to carry out

as well as this other activity.
1
Now, in the lifestyle at the time, not mentioning the second
2
one, this gets back into the recordkeeping that we have been
3
discussing.
It was not to be put on the record although to be
4
done. That is a perfectly proper hypothesis, it seems to me,

but to say that the code stealing was only a cover I think is 1

16
17
think you can draw much conclusion from the actual number on
the figure one way or the other.
18
This might not have been the only such project. You know,
19
an assassination project would cost you more money than that,
20
too.
21
Senator Hart of Colorado. Absolutely.
22
Mr. Colby. I find it hard to say that that is the only
23
amount of money involved. I think you get into a situation
24
where additional money would be put into either of those kinds
25
Senator Hart of Colorado. What about the level of funding
of $7,500 to $10,000?
Mr. Colby. That is not very much money for that kind of
an operation.
Senator Hart of Colorado. Precisely. I think it is too
little.
Mr. Colby. No. For a capability of that nature, it is
largely a staff operation.

Chairman Church.
Before you do, would you just explain
exactly what the relationship between CIA and Giancana and
Maheu was because that is not clear in my mind.
Would you develop for the Committee that whole relationship?
Mr. Breckinridge. Robert Maheu used to work for the
6
FBI and he resigned from the FBI and opened a private investiga-

tive firm here in Washington and CIA used him from time to
8
time for certain kinds of support activities.

What other kind of support?

As nearly as I can reconstruct, the people

20
who knew him decided to put him on a retainer in the Office
of Security, which they did for awhile, until he was so
successful he said he no longer needed the retainer, which he
didn't do much to earn. He later got involved representing
one of the Greek shipping interests and we were given the
results of some of the information that he obtained from that
21
where there was a fight between Niarchos and Onassis.
We
22
think he may have had some involvement in another
23
leader's companionship when he was in this country. I don't
24
have the details. I think we can probably reconstruct it for
25
you.

operation, and the Agent Q. J. Win.

Now, is it a fact that Q. J. Win was the agent, or asset,
however you would refer to him, who apparently was considered
for the effort to assassinate Lumumba, which never took place;
is that right?
15
Mr. Colby. Yes, sir.

in Europe trying to spot and assess individuals whom the Agency

could use in safecracking operations?
