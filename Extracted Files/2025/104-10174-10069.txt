Dear Friend,
Merry Christmas!
I regret that it has taken this long to settle the
matter of your letter of September 22, 1968, but better
late than never, I guess. Although your efforts in our
behalf with Hank were not successful, we do appreciate
the fact that you and your wife went out of your way to
try to help us.
I referred the matter of your late moving bill to
the appropriate individual. Unfortunately, this bilt
was received too late, as all your accounts had been
settled. He has asked me to extend his regrets on
this matter.
Please accept my accept my best wishes for a a Joyous Christmas
and the hope that 1959 will indeed be a good year for
you and yours.
Sincerely,

Your Memorandum dated 26 September 1968
1. In the reference you stated that DO will send FAZZARE
a sterile check for his expenses incurred in his efforts to
persuade TICHBORN's wife to agrow to an assignment in Spain.
You also forwarded a bill which FAZZARE sent for additional
air freight expenses from Madrid for which he has not been
reimbursed...
2. EUR does not wish to reimburse FAZZARE for this
claim. When he resigned from the Agency he submitted his
final accounting and signed a Quit-Claim for all expenses.
In his note to you, a copy of which you forwarded with rof-
erence, he asked that you forward his bill "to the Spanish
Section for reimbursement if not too late..." We would
appreciate it if you could send FAZZARE a note when you for-
ward his sterile check and state that we are sorry but this
final accounting has been completed, that the books have
been cleared, and that it is indeed too late to authorize
additional funds

Termination Settlement
Project WUBRINY
with Edward G. TICHBORN (P)
1. The undersigned on 12 September 1968 went to
New York to effect a termination settlement with Edward G.
TICHSORN (P). A hotel room at the Shoreham Hotel, 33 West
55th Street, was obtained for a meeting place. There were
two principal aspects to the settlement:
a. secure TICHBORN's acceptance of an amend
ment to his contract providing for a one-time lump
sum taxable payment of $3311.00 and releasing the
U. S. Government from any further claim and
b. insure that TICHBORN had, as of 31 August 1968,
administratively severed his relationship with WUSALINE,
particularly that his accountings for expenses in-
curred in 1968 were submitted, recorded by WUSALINE,
and certified correct and proper by both TICHBORN
and WUBRINY/11.
2. The first part of the settlement went smoothly.
TICHBORN on 12 September 1968 readily accepted the amend-
ment to his basic contract. He brought along for the Covert
Tax Unit a copy of his 1966 income tax return which the
undersigned had stipulated as a requirement for settlement.
He was given his one-time lump sum taxable payment of $3311
in two checks ($2833.62 and $477.38) drawn on a DO pro-
prietary company (WUTACTIC) which will issue TICHBORN
a Form 1099 for income tax filing. He readily endorsed
and gave to the undersigned the check for $477.38 in
settlement of the amount he owed WH Division from his
tour in Mexico City.
3. Through no fault of TICHBURN, the administrative
Severance from WUSALINE did not go as smoothly. In spite
of several requests by bot. TICHBORN and the undersigned, undersi
SECRET
201-253203
SECRET
WUBRINY/11 did not have ready a list of expenses incurred.
by TICHBORN in 1968 for checking by the undersigned and
certification by TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11. WUBRINY/11
telephoned to say that his accountant was unable to
locate some of TICHBORN's accountings. The undersigned
then requested WUBRINY/1l to join him and TICHBORN. The
undersigned had a partial list of TICHBORN's expenses
previously submitted by WUBRINY/11. The undersigned
enjoined TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11 to prepare a complete
List of expenses for 1968. TICHBORN was asked to record
the purpose of each expense. The undersigned emphasized
in WUBRINY/11's presence that TICHBORN should ensure that
no expenses chargeable to WUBRINY/1's private firm were
charged to WUSALINE. Both TICHBORN and WUBRINY/ll were
reminded that all expenses on the Venezuela project were
chargeable to WUBRINY/1's private firm as well as one-half
of the expenses on the Mexican Border project. TICH BORN
said that he would get all of the accountings from WUBRINY/11's
comptroller to determine which, if any, accountings were
missing and, as requested, to note the purpose of the
expenses. It was agreed to meet the following morning
of September 13, 1968 on this matter.
4. On the morning of September 13, 1968, TICHBORN
telephoned the undersigned to say that he was able from
his records to supply the missing data. He also sald
that notations on the records obtained from the comptroller
showed that he had, in fact, submitted the accountings that
were missing. TICHBORN concluded from this that WUBRINY/1's
private firm had lost the missing accountings. TICHBORN
also said that a few of the charges on the partial list
of expenses which the undersigned had given him to review
should have been charged to WUBRINY/l's private firm. The
undersigned then requested TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11 to meet
with him at noon so that the undersigned could review the
accountings and obtain certifications from TICHBORN and
WUBRINY/11. Both agreed to the meeting. Subsequently,
TICHBORN telephoned to say that he and WUBRINY/11 were
all set to come to the undersigned's hotel when the
unwitting comptroller took all the financial statements
to review them again. TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11 were in
no position to retain the statements and thus could not
meet as scheduled. Both TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11 agreed
that the accountings were now in order. The undersigned
again informed TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11 by phone that each
must certify that the expenses were proper charges to
WUSALINE. WUBRINY/11 was instructed to mail the list
to the undersigned as soon as possible.

SECRET
SECRET
5. Certain other administrative matters were
taken in with TICHRORY and WUBRINY 11 during the after-
noon of 12 September 1968. The undersigned secured
agreement from TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11 Chat TICHBORN'S
services on WUBRINY/l's Venezuela project were as great
as any other officer who worked on it and that, therefore,
WUSALINE should receive for TICHBORN's services on this
project compensation at least equal to that given any
officer in WUBRINY/1's private firm. The undersigned
obtained from TICHBORN the two credit cards (American
Express and Pan American air travel card) issued to
him under WUSALINE sponsorship. The undersigned asked
TICHBORN if he had charged any expenses under these cards
since: 31 August 1968. TICHBORN said that he had enter-
tained a movie producer who visited him as an outgrowth
of his trip to California to develop a movie adjunct to
his cover. For this reason, TICHBORN opined that the
Agency should pay for the expense. The undersigned said
that TICHBORN was not authorized to incur any further
expenses after 31 August 1968. TICHBORN then readily
agreed to pay the expense.
6. There is a possibility that WH Division may
want TICHBORN to take an operational TDY in Chile..
TICHBORN was alerted to this possibility. He expressed
interest in the assignment, but pointed out that he now
has to get a job and that, consequently, his availability
will depend upon his job situation.
7. TICHBORN was extremely friendly and cooperative
and the settlement was amicably effected.

1. On Monday afternoon, the undersigned was requested
by Mr. Gale Allen, DO/CO, to provide a mechanish for funding
$3,311:00 to an Agent he was terminating (Edward G. TICHBORN
(P). r. Allen is traveling to New York on Thursday,
12 September 1968 and would like to pay the termization bonus
to TIC BORN at that time. Prior to our discussion, Wr. Allen
had arranged for the funds to be paid by sterile check, However,
Mr. Randall, DO/BF, suggested that he consult DO/CV for
funding mechanism in order to insure proper tax reporting by
TICHBORN
2. Mr. Allen explained to the undersigned that TICHSORN
had been employed, until his termination, by one of the Project
WUBRINY entities. Apparently, there is an unwitting Comptroller
in the WUBRINY entity and there was no reasonable story that
could be offered to explain the $3,311.00 termination bonus.
Therefore, it is necessary to use another entity that can pros
vide a Form 1099 for tax purposes.
3. Since WUGAP has sufficient funds in its bank
account to manage a $3,311.00 disbursement, it was decided
to utilize this company. Lt. Allen was advised to stop the
sterile check process and to have the $3,311.00 voucher
approved and forwarded to DO/CM for payment instructions.
At that time, the undersigned will prepare a Request for Advance
of Funds (WUTACTIC) in the amount of $689.00 and Payment
Instructions for $4,000.00 ($3,311.00 plus $689.00): This
procedure is being followed in order that WUGAMP can show
slight profit as well as to prevent the exact same amount of
money being received and disbursed.
