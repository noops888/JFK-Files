PENDING M/R: See TFW memorandum dated 5 November 1962 which was con-
curred in by Moorhouse of CCS with the understanding that I would advise
Mr. Bannerman of the action taken and obtain his approval upon the latters
return on or about 9 November 1962. An exception was made in this case
to the general rule that CIA identification in alias will not be issued
to (State Department) integree integrees. The exception was granted because of
the Subject's position and long experience in matters of this nature
and due to the fact that it will be strictly controlled and limited to
assignment which will be directly by Mr. Harvey.
