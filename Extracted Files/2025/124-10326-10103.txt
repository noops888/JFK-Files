In 1954, a procedure was approved whereby we could attri-
bute certain information received from James Angleton, CIA, under
the symbol "Bureau Informant 100." This information, infor for the most
part, emanated from a Liaison arrangement which CIA maintained with
the Israeli Intelligence Service and from other sources under the
control of Angleton. Much of the information developed by Angleton
was not disseminated within CIA but he felt that the data should be
passed on to the Bureau. Allen Dulles gave him authorization to
handle dissemination in this matter. We continue to receive informa-
tion of value on a regular basis. ☑

offices have had rare occasion to receive Bureau Informant 100 infor-
mation, it is believed desirable to reiterate instructions to the
field. This should be done since the Informant has been developing
information in recent months regarding the travel of U. S. citizens
(5)to Russia via Israel. Such travelers come from various parts of the
