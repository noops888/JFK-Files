1. WITH REGARD TO CLARIFICATION OF SALVADOR ALDEREGUIA'S
ASSOCIATION WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND PARTICULARLY WITH CIA,
REFERENCE B ADVISED THAT HE WAS OF INTEREST TO THIS AGENCY IN 1960
WHEN WE WERE INDIRECTLY INVOLVED IN ASSISTING IN HIS EXFILTRATION
FROM CUBA. HOWEVER, HE TOOK ASYLUM IN THE URUGUAYAN EMBASSY IN
HAVANA ON 3 JULY 1960 AND DEPARTED THE SAME DAY FOR CURACAO. AFTER
HIS ARRIVAL IN MIAMI IN FEBRUARY 1961, THIS AGENCY WAS BRIEFLY IN
CONTACT WITH HIM BUT OUR INTEREST WAS DROPPED PARTLY BECAUSE HIS
UNCLE, ONE OF THE LEADING FOUNDERS OF THE CUBAN COMMUNIST PARTY, WAS
THEN CUBAN AMBASSADOR TO YUGOSLAVIA AND ALDEREGUIA'S TRUE LOYALTIES
WERE UNKNOWN. THIS AGENCY HAS HAD NO INTEREST IN OR CONTACT WITH
ALDEREGUIA SINCE THAT TIME..

DURING 1964-1967. HE WAS TERMINATED IN
JULY 1967, AND WAS CONSIDERED, BUT NEVER USED, FOR ANOTHER
RECRUITMENT ATTEMPT IN 1971. SINCE 1971 RODRIGUEZ HAS NOT BEEN
INVOLVED IN ANY CIA OPERATION IN MIAMI OR ELSEWHERE.
