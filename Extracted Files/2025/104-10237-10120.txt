who would know LLANUZA. TONKU affirmed Owiel was previously

vas under asylum in the Brazilian babassy (sic, Argentine

7. Upon completing the debriefing, Stroud and TOMKU
"exchanged small talk" for a while until TOMEU finally stated
that he still wished there was something more he could do to
help free Cuba, and asked "What do you think I should do?"
Stroud replied that no person could really make that type of
decision for another individual, and countered by asking TOMEU
what alternatives he had in mind, other than remaining in the
68 Army as a career military officer.
8. TOMEU replied that, of course, he was once an
agriculturalist, but that there were few job opportunities in
which he could apply his past experience. His sister had also
ssked him if he felt he and his family would want to live with
bor in Spain or Kexico, but he didn't think too much of this
idea. He then stated that he had been asked by Manuel ARTINK
to take a job as an instructor. Without indicating any
association of even awareness of ARTIME's activities, or of
ARTINE's contact with TOMEU (as indicated in TOMEU's 201),
TOMEU was asked what he thought of ARTINE's proposition.
TOMEU stated that he would no longer follow any man as za
individual or as a leader, because a man's ideals, outlook.
and objectives change with time. For example, the people of
Cuba followed Fidel because of the ideals he advocated. When
Fidel took over, his accomplishments gradually becane quite
different from the ideals he had espoused. TOMEU continued
by saying he would "no longer follow a man, One could only
trust his ideals or an organization which followed those
ideals, since a good organization would be less likely of
being controlled by a single man." When saked for an example
of the type of organization he had in mind, TOMKU replied he
Vas most favorably inclined towards the ideals and goals of
the JURE. (The JURE or JRC is an organization crested by
Manolo RAY Rivero around a nucleus of former. 26 July Movement
leaders, Bee memo and attachment dated 23 July 1963 from John
Bugh Cranmins, Coordinator of Cuban Affairm, ARA, Departmens
af State in TOMKU's 201-283206.)

9. It should, perhaps, be noted here that in an informal
exchange with Mrs. Donald WEBSTER, TOKIU's supervisor at the
Defense Language Institute, Anacostia Naval Annex, 4 June 64,
Mrs. VERSTER volunteered the information that "all of the other
'Brigade students here' have told me they think very highly
of TOKKU, and that he is a very brave nan, because he and his
family vere very wealthy in Cuba and he gave it all up to go
into exile and fight the Castro Regins."
