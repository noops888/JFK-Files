2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 199240
24 February 1967
MEMORANDUM
SUBJECT: Estimate of Damage Which Could Accrue to CIA
Miami Through Prosecution of the Rolando
Masferrer Haitian Invasion Group
1. The decision by the Justice Department to seek a
Grand Jury indictment against Rolando Lasferrer and certain
of his associates is a potentially explosive matter which
could result in extensive damage to CIA activities in
Miami. Recent adverse publicity on the national scene and
in the Miami area have added substantially to the already
sizeable embarrassment potential. Some of the main sectors
of danger to CIA equities are described below.
2. Basic national publicity regarding student and
foundation topics have already attracted attention of the
local press to the CIA in general. Usually any reference
to CIA covert activities leads the press to check files for
references to any such activities locally. However, before
this action could be taken, the story regarding the Pan
American Foundation and the University of Miami broke, and
the press immediately concentrated on this topic. The CIA
Chief of Station learned through personal press contacts
that this was partly a matter of luck and partly because
of the friendly and cooperative attitude of these press
contacts. Although several editorials highly critical of
CIA have been published and the replay of wire service
stories has been given much space, as yet there has been
no local follow-up aimed at putting CIA or the CIA Station
on the spot. However, the situation remains delicate,
since, even with much good will, local newsmen cannot
afford to let themselves be scooped by outsiders concerning
stories in their own back yard.
3. Any new story, such as the 22 February story in
Miami Journal Tribune on suspected CIA connection with
recruitment of Cuban pilots for the Congo, the possible
results of inquiry made on 21 February by three students
connected with the University of Miami newspaper The
Hurricane, or further revelations concerning the Pan
American Foundation, could easily trigger publicity with
an inevitable focus on the South Campus of the University
of Miami and on the Miami Station cover firm.

4. As has been the case for the past six years,
Dr. Henry King Stanford (President) and Dr. Eugene Other,
Vice President and Treasurer) of the (University of Miami)
have extended their fullest cooperation concerning the
Miami Station and overall CIA interests and it is antici-
pated they will continue to do so. However, we believe
there is a practical limit to the amount of pressure they
could stand from their trustees and from certain public
quarters if there is a flood of publicity regarding CIA
activities allegedly centered in or controlled from the
(Cenith Technical Enterprises Inc.), or its accused successor,
the (Holman Corporation). Should such a situation arise, it
is conceivable that Dr. Stanford would feel impelled
to take some action aimed at dissociating the (University
of Miami) from any contact with the (Holman Corporation).
Since the (Holmar Corporation) is ostensibly the tenant of
the (University of Miami) although on Federal property,
the resulting action might involve a request for the
termination of the tenancy agreement.
5. Even if the above circumstances did not exist, we
would remain concerned regarding the possible effects of
the prosecution of the Masferrer group. Although no
Station agents or persons with whom the Miami Station
has contractual arrangements are among the persons arrested
or those who will be prosecuted, it will be very easy for
the defense to drag CIA Miami into the case. The defense
has only to obtain testimony (true or perjured) from one
of the defendants, or to summon as defense witnesses one or
more disaffected former agents of the CIA Station, in
order to begin a chain reaction surfacing much detail
and rumor concerning CIA operations against the Cuban
target. Given the sizeable reduction of infiltration
and covert action agents during the past year, a general
feeling of frustration and lack of support for Cuban
freedom attributed to passive U.S. policy and reduction
of support in all sectors, the long standing animosity
of certain exile circles against U.S. Government, notably
CIA, and the evaluation that CIA now is the most vulnerable
of Federal Agencies confronting the exiles, will be
tempted to see an attack against CIA as accomplishing
several purposes, that is, gaining acquittal, blackening
CIA, and exerting pressure on the U.S. Government for a
policy change.
