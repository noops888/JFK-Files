DLMORANDUM: FOR THE SPECIAL GROUP (AUCHENTEL)
From: Erig. Gen. Lansdale Ed
Subject: Operation Mongoose Progress
Intelliaence build-up by CIA includes efforts to recruit a
Cuban ciplomat in-place and an official in an airlines cifice in
Havana The CIA team piaced in Pinar del Rio Province last
March was successfully re-supplied by maritime means on
24 May. The Navy and CIA lave worked out a cooperative effort
to strengthen the U.S. security and intelligence program at
Cuantanamo.
The CAC continues to provide word from inside Cuba cover-
ing local security moves and popular unrest (unrest reportedly
increasing). A substantial reduction in oil refining and menu-
facture of tires and tubes is reported from CAC sources.
Economic pressure upon the Communist regime may be
increased by a Lepartment of Commerce move denying bunkering
facilities at U.S. poris to vessela under Sino-Soviet bloc charter
carrying cargo to Cuba. State Department reports having solicited
views of our Arabassador to Japan regarding passible approaches
to the Japanese asking them to cease sugar purchases from Cuba.
57101
Promaranca efforts of USIA and CIA continue to apply pressure
upon the Cusan regime by focusing upon abuses of power and failure
of key programs such as medical and iod. The VOA use of refugees
in interviews especially underlined this theme. I am looking into a
USIA proposal that we counter Communist Cuba moves to impress
Latin America by participation in the athletic North Central American
and Caribbean Cares set for August 11-25 in Kingston, Jamaica: a
"free Cuba" team might be effective, with good publicity support.

Incident at Guantanamo occurred 26 May when a light Cuban
aircrait lanced there. Three Cubans had forces the pilot, at
pistol point, to land then at our Naval Ease. With State'a con-
currence, Defense acted: the Cupan pilot flew home, the 3 Cuban
cscapees stayed on the base.

brougat a very healthy response from CIA and USIA. The CIA
determination to meet the challengo has suríaced four policy-type
questions which I note for you on behalf of CIA:
G

Teasicle, if the Group will approve CIA arranging with
Navy for use of a submarine. CIA has fire plans for
worrying the Communist regime through broaccавів
which would appear to come from local dissident groups
actively planning to harass the regime.
2). Task 19, CIA is prepared to disseminate leaflets on Castro's
failure to the Cuban population via balloon with a view of
increasing instability of the Communist Gachine. The
technique is tested and CIA has plans to operate iron a
surface chip in international waters. The Group ic
asked to approve the idea, including Navy support. This
coulu be operating in time to exploit the 26 July anniversary
of Castro'e attack upon government forces at Santiago de
Cuba in 1953, for "the revolution'he has now betrayco.
3). Task 19. CIA believes it can recruit some 20-an teams
for possible use in beeting up resistance groups within Cuba.
Croup approval is asked for Iefense support in training,
holding, logistics. The 'noise level' hazard is noted, but
this special project could be ai nost unnoticed if t! sed with
proposed U.S. military enlist sent of Cubans.

Tack 23, Counterfeit Currency to increase Cuban economic
problems is concicered feasible within 30-6 days upon a
limited basis and in considerable scale within six months.
CIA asks the Group approval before proceecing with this
action.
Other Tasks.
I note here that CIA does not feel it has the operational means
to undertake Task No. 22, black-market activities for this time. Fur-
ther that Task No. 11. Time magazine dissemination, would require
operational facilities not now available. I accept indefinite celerral of
Task No. 22 and scrubbing of Task No. 11 on this basis.
The Lepartment of State reaction, to my effort to get the U.S..
into priority actions towards our project's goals, has been cisappointing
to me thus far. Apparently, my schedule of targets for special elforts
is accepted only as it may fit into long-range, existing programs already
under way. If this is the theory of our project, I believe that the project
then becomes only a special reporting device and not a special U.S.
effort to win the goal of helping the Cusans recapture their country
from a gang of Communists.
