would be accepted until the status of the Vernon Fund van clarified. John
THOMPSON felt that the best slution would be a one-time only infusion of
money by sterile check into the SCOTP bank account to be backstopped by a
Lotter from the attorney for the Vernon Find, Bryce REA, who would attribute
the money to maubers of the Vernon Fund Board who anonymously wished to
provide MCOTP with sufficient sunda to cover expenses until other sources
could be found.

sentative an interview he had with Mike MacHANUS of TIME magazine on

WCOLP operations. HecMANUS was especially interested in any econputes forced
on WCOPP sad a request for proof of the value of KCOTP operations to individual

additional information from the intervier to warrant writing his projected
erticle.
