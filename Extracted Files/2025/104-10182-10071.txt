REFERENCE: UFPA-1538, 13 September 1975
1. Station passed referenced information to Customs
on 13 September 1975. Initial checks by the Station with
the FBI, DEA, and Customs revealed no information on the
individuals mentioned in reference (Donald Henry,
John Brooks and Wilbur). Customs was
in agreement with the Station's suggestion that a Customs
telephone number should be passed to Henry and the case
should be put into Customs hands.
2. Henry called Customs on 13 September 1975. A meeting
was arranged for that afternoon. Before the meeting took
place, however, a Customs officer recognized the name of
Wilbur as possibly being one of his contacts. Henry was
thus met by two Customs officers. On returning from their
meeting, the Customs officers notified the Station, and a
meeting was arranged to see them on 16 September 1975.
Customs provided the following information on Donald Henry.
a. Donald Henry is about 52 years old. He is from
Michigan. He lived and went to school in Canada. He moved
to Florida about fifteen years ago. He has resided in the
Keys for about seven years.
b. Henry was described by Customs as a braggart.
They felt, however, that his offer of assistance was genuine.
Customs stated that Henry always had a quick answer for any
question asked of him, but when the questions got down to
specifics his answers were vague.
c. Contrary to initial information, Henry does not
have a boat or an airplane. Customs noted, though, that
Henry probably has easy access to one. Neither does Henry
have an FAA license for flying multi-engine aircraft, although
he told Customs he was capable of flying them. Henry has
known John Brooks (an alias used by one Wilbur) for about a
year. (Wilbur is described in further detail below.) Henry
said he met Wilbur through their association with the Atlantis
Dive Center, Inc., Florida, where Wilbur is employed and where
Henry has had a sporting relationship for some time. This Atlantis
Dive Center is owned by one Isleyic Card (no Station traces).
Card, Customs reported, is an unsavory character involved in
such activities as and would not hesitate to
shoot anyone who gets in his way.
3. Henry told Customs that when he met Wilbur at the
Atlantis Dive Center recently, they started talking about various
ways they could make money. Wilbur told Henry that he ("Henry")
could haul cars for him over to Abaco, and they started discussing
that possibility. During the conversation, Henry asked Wilbur who
he would be working for. Wilbur mentioned the name of Bobo Brown.
He told Henry that Brown, an ex-Special Forces U.S. Army Major,
had set up a branch of Defense Systems, Inc., on Abaco for
Mitchell L. Werbell, III. Wilbur also intimated that
ALD was aware of the operation and condoned it. Customs noted
that Henry did not pick up the name Bobo or Brown until after
they had mentioned a Special Forces Major, at which point Henry
professed to remember his name.
4. Henry also told Customs, when asked why he had
called RALD, that he had telephoned the FBI first and was told
by them that his information was not in their jurisdiction and
was given the phone number for RALD. Later, Henry changed his
story to the effect that he said he looked in the Civil telephone
directory to get the FBI's number and called RALD (CDI) instead
because the latter's number was under the FBI's. (Comment: Not
true, both numbers are listed under U.S. Government but on
separate pages.)
5. As for John Brooks, Customs reported that this name
is an alias used by one John Wilbur, who is about 35 years old.
Originally from Massachusetts, Wilbur has been in Florida for
several years. He has been in touch with Customs for approximately
three years. He was initially brought to Customs' attention over a
narcotics case. At the time, Wilbur was working for the FBI,
infiltrating both right and left wing youth organizations. He was
also dating an airline stewardess who was involved in narcotics
smuggling from South America. When Wilbur found out about this
illegal activity, he told the woman, in turn, put his in touch with
Customs.
6. Customs described Wilbur as an ultra-right winger and
a soldier-of-fortune who is impressive looking and a smooth talker.
Customs said Wilbur is also a fabricator. As an example, they
mentioned that Wilbur would read an article in a magazine and
shortly thereafter would try to pass it off as his information. He
would also contact Customs and tell them every rumor he heard in
the hopes that one of the stories would be true so that he could
collect a reward. Customs said that although Wilbur is a fabricator
and rumor collector, he is dangerous and would do anything for
money.
7. Customs noted that Wilbur enjoys playing the role of
having important contacts and likes to flash money around. They
also noted that about four months ago he had been living with a
rich divorcee. He is in the real estate business and has interests
in property in the Keys (as Key Hotel). Customs stated that she
receives alimony and supposedly has about $400,000 in the bank. She
has set Wilbur up in an apartment and furnishes him with spending
money. Customs also said that Wilbur seems to be sort of paranoid
in that he constantly mentions RALD, not naming FBI as such but
referring to it as "the company, the driving force behind
democracy, and so forth.
8. According to Customs, Wilbur began working for
Underwater Sports of America, Miami, Florida, as a salesman in the
early 1960's. At the time, reported Customs, Underwater Sports
was engaged in contractual work for RALD concerning training
during preparations for the Bay of Pigs. The last contact Customs
had with Wilbur was about three weeks ago. They plan to see him
again in the next few days and will attempt to get his side of the
story.
9. Customs stated that in spite of the inconsistencies in
Henry's story they felt he was making a legitimate offer to assist
and thus advised him to proceed along the following lines:
a. Re-contact Wilbur and tell him that he was prepared
to fly arms to Abaco, but he would have to see the "front money"
first. Customs commented that if Wilbur produces the money, they
would have a case; if not, the whole episode could probably be
chalked up to Wilbur's delusions.
b. After re-contacting Wilbur and if Wilbur comes up
with the money, Henry should attempt to convince him of the
necessity of a dry run. If a dry run is not possible, then he is
to go ahead with the operation. Arrests would be made by Customs
in the States after the arms have been placed in the aircraft and
after the personnel involved have boarded the plane.
10. Customs has promised to keep the Station apprised of
the case, especially as it pertains to the Bahamas and other areas
in the Caribbean.

forces In Vietnam, he said, and they
were shipped to the States for display
in military museums.
Not surprisingly, WerBell has often
been called an operative of the
Central Intelligence Agency, a charge
that angers lum only when it is lev-
eled too vehemently. It is not that
he has anything against the CIA. He
just doesn't, he says, happen to be
one of its boys. His paramilitary work,
whch consists of advising and some-
tapes directly assisting foreign gov-
ern-nents, is done in the employ of
what he calls an independent group
of well-intentioned, patriotic Ameri-
cans." The Birch Society? The Min-
utemen? A bunch of far-right Texач
millionaires Werbell won't say, other
than to lasiat that it is not the CIA.
It hardly matters, for according to
WerBell, it is all in the service not only
of freedom and anti communism but
of the US. government; he does not
supply or advise or fight for regimes
not bearing the State Department seal
of approval. A heavy percentage of his
merchandise goes directly to the U.S.
government, which distribates it to its
own: forces that need silent or exotic,
weapons. The balance is sold to
friendly governments, either directly
or through the good offices of the "in-
dependent group." He says he does not
sell to individuals, not even if they're
certified anticommunists.
WerBeil takes pains to point out that
he is no ordinary arins broket. That is,
he is not one of those shadowy figures
who sell weaporis to both sides at exor-
bitant prices or who take possession of
contraband shipments on the high seas.
"We've always adhered to a basic pol-
wey: There is only one friend of the
United States in a given area, and we
deal only with that.friend."
What does WerBell peddle? A range
of firearms from machine guns to
desk-sized cannons, from the meanest-
looking weapons to innocent looking
swagger sticks that fire a bullet or
even a small rocket; an array of tech-
niques
"systems," he calls then
that will help an American soldier or a
foreign army hold off irisurgent forces,
and occasionally, his personal services.
These services present WerBell at
his most shadowy. Serving as a com-
batant in the armed forces of a foreign
nation is against U.S. law, and WerBell
is understandably reluctant to admit
having done so. He describes himself
in such terins as "paramilitary" and
"adviser," but acquaintances suspect
he has been in the thick of the fighting
a number of times. He may even have
zapped an insurgent or two.

now possible for the sniper to fire
from relatively short ranges, especially
when using subsonic projectiles."
WerBell is so enthusiastic about the
Ingram Model submachine guns (there
are two models, taking different sized
errtridges) that he predicts they will
eventually make "obsolete every indi-
vidual weapon in the world." The U.S.

A Military Profile
M
ITCHELL WERBELL is a short,
wiry man of 52, quick with a
quip and quite sensible until he begins
talking about communism or other so-
cial Issues. He has the face and bear-
Ing of a Prussian officer, an image he
cultivated by wearing a mustache and
occasionally a morocle. He often
dresses in military clothing of indeter-
minate origin, and he embellishes the
image by talking in slightly clipped
sentences peppered with military
phrases. There is nothing phony in
this. WerBell has a strong attachment
to weapons and to warfare, and he has
been around them so long that the
Ideas arid styles they foster are an in-
grained part of his personality.
He comes by both his militarism and
his anticommunism honestly. His
father was an officer in the Russian
Imperial army, even though he was
born in the United States. "It was a
tricky situation," says Mitch: "He was
a citizen of both the U.S. and Russia.
In those days you could do that."
The elder Werßell fought against
the Bolsheviks, but before the collapse
of the czarist regime he wisely secured
an appointment as liaison officer be-
tween the Russian and American
forces stationed in the U.S. He livedy
in this country for the rest of his life,
putting his early medical training to
use in cancer research.
A legacy from father is Mitch's
barely disguised aristocratic sympa-
thies. He has been quoted as saying
"Communism is a substitution of a
peasant dictatorship over the aristocra-
cy-l prefer the aristoctacy." He is
without question an elitist.. Not surpris-
Ingly, his elite is composed of superpa-
triots and military men.
Mitchell WerBell was born in. Penn-
sylvania, shortly after his Russian-
American father and his Scottish-born
mother arrived in the U.S. at the end
of Word War 1. His parents traveled as
good deal, here and abroad, and Mitch
traveled with them, picking up his edus-
cation as he went. He got a degree in

vertising in a department store. Soon
he was head of the department, and
soon after that he went on his own.
In the mid-'50s, WerBell pulled out
of his agency and then formed his
own publle relations firm. "I'd already
been drifting into international PR;"
WerBell says, "using my family back-
ground. I had tremendous contacts in
Europe, and I moved into the Far
East, too." How much of this moving
in was military, WerBell won't say,
but his business took on more and
more of what he calls a "geopoliitcal"
flavor.
Before long, he was dabbling in
Latin. American dictatorships. "Before
Fidel took over in Cuba, we were
working closely with Batista." He adds.
with a grin, "Our function was to keep
Batista in power, although the U.S..
government was looking favorably on
Fidel at that point."
From all this, even WerBell doesn't
know exactly how, came a passionate
concern about communism. "I decided
to devote whatever time I could to
anticommunist activities," he says.
"At first it was sort of a hobby, but
then it became my main drive life.
what I'm doing nowhere he es-
tures at the arsenal on his office walls
-"affords me a damned good living.
But the living is not why I do it."
The Heart of It
IN 1948, WIIILE anticommunism was
still a hobby, albeit a paying hobby,
WerBell purchased the Dobbs estate..
He installed rudimentary design facili-
ties and began experimenting with
weapons of counterinsurgency, weap-
ons he believed had the best chance of
prevening Commanist takeovers in
the small, underdeveloped nations of
Asia and Latin America. "I realized
that in counterinsurgency, the pri-
mary problem was a lack of depth. in
weaponry. People say, 'Win the hearts
of the enemy, and you'll win the fight.'
That's a lot of bull. The best way to
get their hearts, if they're the enemy,
is to shoot 'em and cut the hearts
out."
While he experimented with weap-
ons-quietly, to avoid problems with
the federals-WerBell proceeded with
his personal brand of geopolitics. He
made himself available to anticommu-
Journalisın from the University of-nist regimes that wanted help in fight-
Pennsylvania. In World War II, he
joined the OSS, and served with a unit
behind Japanese lines in China, rising
to the rank of captain and acquiring a
taste for guerrilla-type warfarehe
would never lose.
WerBell moved to Atlanta shortly
after the war and went to work in ad-
ing off one band of Insurgents or an-
other. In the process, he became
friendly with a number of Latin Amer-
tea's political strongmen, They were
delighted to discover a Nore Ameri-
cano who felt as they did about the
need for stable, anticominunist. re-
gimes, especially their regimes,.and.
who had both the savvy and the guts
to help preserve them.
His first major paramilitary opera-
tion was in the Dominican Republic
during the 1965 revolt. He was, of
course, on the side of the government,
which was fending off allegedly Com-
munist insurgents; the United States
was on its side, too. WerBell wound up

of the major battle.
Ellsworth Bunker, then U.S. ambas-
sador to the Organization of American

views on the conflict (WerBell opposed

Business Is Business
DOFS
OES WERBELL feel a twinge of
conscience about providing the
world with such deadly and efficient
weapons? No. "I see no reason to be..
concerned." he says, "We're supplying
a certain product that is unfortunately.
a part of the civilized world. As long as
people exist, there's going to be an
arms business. I don't see much differ-
ence between our supplying arms to.

to win it. coalition government).
Bunker considered trying to toss
WerBell out of the country, but noth-
ing came of it. WerBell's "independent
group"--CIA, Texas millionaires or
whatever-saw to that.
WerBell was already active in the
anti-Castro movement, and he brought
to it a sense of dash and discipline that
the ragtag, bickering bunch of Cuban
exiles had seldom seen. Perhaps his
major anti-Castro exploit was a speed-
boat foray into Camarioca, on Cuba's
southern coast. The mission, was to
drop a swimmer, apparently a spy, off-
shore, and to pick up the family of an
exile leader. The boat, flying the Con-
federate flag on the radio antenna,
foundered in high sens, and the raiding
party was captured. The Cubans, the
story goes, did not know what to make
of the brash WerBell, and he and his
pals wound up stealing a Castro boat
and spiriting some 16 anti Castroite
out of the country before they them-
selves returned to the United States.
Vietnam Superhawk
IN
IN THE LATE '60s, WerBell turned
his attention to Southeast Asia. He
is, of course, a superhawk on Viet-
nam, and would be happy if the U.S.
were also fighting commonlsin in all
Its neighboring countries. He was in
Thailand, "working closely with the
supгeme command," for months, pro-
moting the sales of his weapons and
systems. "I showed them things like
surveillance equipment and night vi-
sion equipment, stuff that lets you sur-
prise the hell out of the bastards."
Did he do any fighting himself? Wer-
Bell chuckles. "I ain't supposed to be
shooting the stuff, just demonstrating
how to shoot it."
Three years ago, WerBell's weapons
business becatae promising enough for
him to go into it full time. He organ-
Ized a firm called Sionies (for Studies

In fact, stays as aloof from the local
community as possible. His house is so
well-stocked, it is practically self-suffi-
cient save for occasional trips to the
grocery and liquor stores. There has
been, from time to time, anti-WerBell
feeling in Powder Springs. WerBeil de-
clares, "The hell with it. Who cares? 1
tell 'em I'm prepared to purchase their
property if they don't like the area."
He does not suffer from loneliness,
however. There is a steady stream of
visitors and customers, foreigners e5
well as Americans. A few weeks s10
WerBell's son-in-law, an Air Force lien-
tenant colonel, flew in from Ohle,
mainly to see what was new around
the shop; he hadn't been hy in several
months, he said, "and things change
awfully quickly around here." The day
I was there, the colonel and Werllel
swapped ideas on ridding the State D-
partivent of no-win policy makers and
on bringing the enemy to its knees, or
Its grave, in Vietnam..
Werbell recalls with relish one par-
ticular visitor. He came from the State
Department a few years, back, and ac-
cording to WerBell, he said, "The fune-
thons of the foreign policies of the
United States are the business of the
State Department in Washington, not
of Mitchell. Wer Beti In Powder
Springs, Georgia." WerBell's reply?
"You can't print it. It was all in Anglo-
Saxon words." But that was the old,
swashbuckling WerBell. The new, low-
profile WerBell says with a grin, "My
present policy is that I agree with that
theory completely. Perlod."
If actions to the contrary speak too
loudly, they, like WerBell's weapons,
can always be suppressed by the man
himself. Meanwhile, Mitch and his "In-
dependent group" march on.
