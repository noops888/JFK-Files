Mr. Halley, is it true that you are here
2
testifying today under alias, and that Halley is not actually
your true identity?
Mr. Halley. That is correct.
6
Mr. Baron. Your true identity will be on file with the
7
review staff of the CIA and available for verification by the
8
Committee if that becomes necessary?
9
10
Mr. Halley. That is my understanding.
Mr. Baron.
Let me show you a piece of paper marked
11 "Statement Regarding Testimony and Alias" and let me ask you
12
whether this is the statement you signed as we were beginning
14
15
16
13
here today which indicates your true identity and which I have
witnessed?
Mr. Halley. Yes, that is the correct statement that I
17
signed today. There is a blank there where we have not filled
18
in the Senator's name.
19
Mr. Baron. All right.
For the moment, let us leave that blank and enter it into
2G
the record as is, as Exhibit 1.

Mr. Baron. Are you aware that you have the right to counsel

Mr. Halley. Yes, I am.
Mr. Baron. Are you appearing here, voluntarily here today
without counsel?
Mr. Halley. Yes, I am.
Mr. Baron. Are you also aware that at any point you are
entitled to cease answering any questions and consult with
counsel if you wish?
Mr. Halley. Yes, I am aware of that.
Mr. Baron. Finally, are you aware that all your Constitu-

I are contemplating having a Senator swear you in and ask you if

your transcript is true to the best of your knowledge at some

Mr. Halley. Yes. The statement that you have just made

is my understanding of the agreement that we entered into prior

to this conversation going on the record.
9
Mr. Baron. Thank you.
10
Let us begin then with some very broad questions
:
11
12
13
about your background in the Agency. Can you tell me what you
were doing in the Agency prior to your involvement with the
JMWAVE station?

Mr. Halley. I became involved with the Cuban affair in
approximately February of 1962. At that time, I was in Head-
quarters. I was Chief of Foreign Intelligence Activities for the
Eastern European Division. I was asked to be released from those
duties to conduct a survey of the opportunities for running
intelligence operations against Cuba. I was released from those
duties; I did engage in a survey of the possibilities for running
intelligence, counterintelligence, paramilitary operations
21
22
against Cuba.
23
24
Mr. Baron. Your position as Chief of Foreign Intelligence
for Eastern Europe did not involve Cuba in any way? That was
25
your last position before you became involved in Cuban affairs,

is that correct?
2
Mr. Halley. That is correct.
3
I want to qualify that.
Undoubtedly, there were some
4
5
6
7
actions that were being conducted in the Eastern European area
that reflected on Cuba, but I was not involved in the Bay of Pigs
operation. I was not fully focused on Cuban operations until
approximately February of 1962.

Mr. Baron. At what point did you join the Agency?
Mr. Halley.
I joined the Agency originally in 1951.
Mr. Baron. In a very general way, can you describe the
nature of your activities at the Agency prior to February of '62
Mr. Halley. When I was first assigned to the Agency, I was
an Army officer on active duty. I went through the usual Agency
training program. I was assigned to Eastern European activities
where I originally was focused on Polish and German operations.
15
16
17
I subsequently served from 1952 to 1959 in Germany. In the
course of that service, I spent most of my time working on the
18
19
20
Eastern European satellites, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary,
Romania, Bulgaria. In addition, I was involved on occasion in
Soviet operations and East German operations.
21
22
23
Mr. Baron. Did you have any involvement in Latin American
affairs prior to February of '62?
Mr. Halley. Yes. In the period 1960-62, I was responsible
24
for setting up operational activity in Latin America that
25
was targetted more explicitly on the Eastern European satellites

to some extent on the Soviet Union. This was in a period of time
where the Eastern European satellites were expanding their
3 presence in Latin America. In my duties in the Eastern European
:
5
Division, I was responsible for getting this program going in
Latin America, so I did have an extensive exposure to Latin
6
7
America: in the period '60 to '62, as I recall those dates.
The accuracy of those dates can be checked from my official
travel records, and so on.

16
Mr. Halley. No, I was stationed in Washington, but I
travelled to Latin America during this particular period of
time.
Mr. Baron. Did you travel to Cuba at any point during the
course of that operation?
Mr. Halley. Not specifically. I think I transitted Cuba
17
on air stops being routed to various countries.
I think I was
18
at one or two Cuban airfields, but simply in transit.
Mr. Baron.

Not long enough even to talk to the people at
the Station in Cuba?

Mr. Halley.
21
No, I had no contact at any time with the
Havana Station.
22
23
Mr. Baron. Did you pick up, during this period of time,
24
a general sense of the attitude of Latin American governments
25
toward the Castro government? Could you characterize that

Mr. Halley. I certainly was aware, I think, of the broad
political trend in the Hemisphere at that time, my interest was
much more narrowly focused at that time on the Eastern European
targets, and on the Soviet target, and I was not certainly
specializing in Cuban affairs at that juncture.
Mr. Baron. Cuba was not viewed at that juncture as part of
the Soviet target, as a Soviet satellite?
Mr. Halley. No, it was not.
Mr. Baron. Coming then to February of '62, is that the
point at which you joined the JMWAVE Station in Miami?
Mr. Halley. No. When I first entered into this survey,
it was to do this on a TDY basis, temporary duty assignment,
to complete a report on my findings, to report those at that
particular juncture to Mr. Harvey who was the head of the Task
Force that was attempting to expand intelligence coverage of
Cuba and I was not assigned to the station at that particular
point in time.
Mr. Baron.
At what point did you join the JMWAVE Station?
Mr. Halley. Shortly after having completed this survey.
These dates are blurred now because the survey soon turned into
a permanent assignment. I would have to check the exact dates
from my service records, but after having completed the survey
report, shortly thereafter I was asked to go to Miami to become
permanently assigned to the station in Miami. I do not recall

the end of May of '62?
Would you assume that that was sometime before
5
Mr. Halley. Yes. It was probably before that, but as I
6
say, there are a couple of weeks gap that we would have to look
7
at my service record to get the exact dates, but certainly it
8
could have been March, it could have been April: But I reserve,
9
you know, the right to check my record if that is a critical
10 point in terms of what you are trying to establish.
11
Mr. Baron.
Certainly.
12
13
I should say generally at this point, if anything we cover
today gives you that kind of problem it would be immensely
14
15
helpful to us if you would check your answers against documents
that might be available in the CIA.
16
Mr. Halley. Yes, all right.
17
Mr. Baron. In fact, let me ask you if you would check that
18
19
one out, because it would be useful to know exactly when you
joined the JMWAVE station.
20
21
22
During the period of time before you joined JMWAVE, while
you were conducting the survey, did you report to anyone other
than William Harvey?
23
24
Mr. Halley. In a formal sense, this TDY was conducted on
behalf of the task force commander, who was Mr. Harvey. While
25
I was in Miami conducting the survey, I obviously discussed

matters pertaining to that survey to the team who was then in

That team was
3
essentially headed by Mr. Al Cox, who has since died.
4
Mr. Baron. Was that team the equivalent of JMWAVE station?
5
6
7
Mr. Halley. Yes. Mr. Cox was the head, then, of what would
be the equivalent of the JMWAVE Station.
Mr. Baron. Was he the head of JMWAVE until the wint when
8
you replaced him, or until the point you became Chief of the
9 JMWAVE Station?
10
Mr. Halley. That is correct. He was the head of that
11 unit until such time as I replaced him.
12
13
Mr. Baron. Were you aware during this survey that you
were conducting of any link between Task Force Wand the so-called

19
Special Group in the White House which was part of the National
Security Council structure and used the project namer! MONGOOSE
for anti-Cuban operations?
Mr. Halley. My understanding at the time that I conducted
this survey was that there was a three-man group in existence
which was headed by Mr. Robert Kennedy that was conducting a
20 survey to see what kind of activities could be conducted against
21
Cuba.
22
The other members of that particular group were General
Lansdale and Mr. Helms.
This three-man group had subordinate to it for all practical
23
24
purposes the task force unit which was managed by Mr. Harvey.
25
I am not familiar, however, with the other terminology that you

Mr Baron.During the whole period of your involvement
with JMWAVE, you were not made aware of Project MONGOOSE as
such?
Mr. Halley. I am not aware of Project MONGOOSE. I do not
recall it as an acronym, cryptonym or anything else that was in
common usage in my conversations.
Also, you have to understand that during that particular
time, Mr. Harvey was subordinate to the normal Agency chain of
12 command. In other words, he had parallel lines, if you wil1.
13 There was this three-man Task Force to whom he was reporting
14

regularly. At the same time, as the Task Force Commander, he
was reporting to the then-DDP who was Mr. Helms.
Mr Baron. You began your survey just about the time that
Mr. Helms replaced Mr. Bissell as DDP?
Mr. Halley. That is right.
Mr. Baron. Were you aware of the command relationship
between the three-man group that you have mentioned and William
Harvey as head of Task Force W? Did that group task Harvey
directly, or did Harvey's assignments have to come through Helms
and through the DCI as opposed to this group that did not include
the DCI?
Mr. Halley. My understanding of it at the time was we were

1 really talking about parallel lines. In other words, this
2 three-man group was meeting. Mr. Helms was both a member of
3
that particular group and the DDP. Therefore, when he came back
4
5
6
7
from one of these meetings and issued instructions to Mr. Harvey
it was, you know, tantamount to these things coming through two
channels simultaneously, one coming from this three-man task
force and the other instruction simultaneously coming from Mr.
Helms who was the DDP.
Mr. Baron. As far as Mr. Harvey was concerned, an assign-
ment or order from Richard Helms was an order to be taken at
8

12
13
14

16
17
18
face value? Harvey did not have to question whether it had the
stamp of approval from the DCI or not? Would that have been
your operating understanding?
Mr. Halley. That would have been my understanding, yes.
Certainly an instruction received from Mr. Helms was a valid
Agency instruction.
Mr. Baron.
The DCI at this point was John McCone.
Mr. Hallay. That is correct.
Mr. Baron.
Do you have any knowledge of the relationship
between this three-man group and John McCone at that point?
Mr. Halley.
Not on a day to day basis. Once I went to
Miami, I came back on a regular basis to review operational
plans and programs. On one occasion I accompanied Mr. McCone
to the White House to give a presentation or sit in while the
presentation was being made.
