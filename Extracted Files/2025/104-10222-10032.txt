Attached is a draft of an amendment on TICHSOLN.
Hote cemo of reapest asks for an increase in basic
fee from $12,000 to $17,000% based on TICHPOPN's
"overall performance and full time services". Thia
Additional memoranda in file reflect the
following:
(1) 19 Nay 1961 contract (still in effect) provided
a basic fee of $8000 with no mention of amount
of time gubject worked to earn such.
(2) imamo of 18 June 63 asked a pay increase from
$3000 to $5000 based upon, "manner of TICHPOPN'S
performance and the increase amt. of time which
he devotes to Agency requirements".
(3) H dispatch of 9 Nov 64 said that, "Hqs agrees
that present expiring contract called for about
2/3rds subject's time---TICHROHN pointed out....
he now engaged 90% of his time for Agency".
(4) Wi memo of 24 Nov 61 requested an increase from
$9000 to $12,000 based upon TICHBORN'S increased
value plus "using TICHBOmi's service on
sbstantially a full time basis".
:
(5) As cited above, current WH memo of 7 Oct 66 asks
for an increase of & from $12,000 to $17,000
based on subject's "overall performance and full
time services".
I pointed out the above chromowith respect to
the ever increasing usage of subject's time to Renekah

Dear Mr.drea
Reference is made to your current contract with the United States
Government, as represented by the Contracting Officer.
Arrangements have been recently completed allowing certain
Independent contractors of this organization to obtain social security
credits by covering such individuals under the social security tax
provisions applicable to employees. These arrangements also include
a provision for retroactive applicability to the beginning of the
1965 tax year. This can be done only for reasons of security since
the procedure results in reducing the social security tax from the
self-employed rate to the employee rate. For example, in January
of 1965 the tax rates were 5.4% and 3-5/8% respectively.
As a consequence thereof, said contract is amended by deleting
all reference to social security and by adding the following paragraph:
"Effective I December 1964, social security taxes will be covertly
deducted by this organization from your compensation in the same
manner and to the same extent as would be done if you were a Govern-
ment employee. Security reasons make this procedure necessary. Its
implementation does not imply in any manner the actual creation of an
employee-employer relationship, Your legal status under this agree-
ment continues to be that of an independent contractor."
If you receive or expect to receive full or partial social security.
credits from overt sources you will so notify this organization and an
adjustment will be made or covert deductiona discontinued, depending
upon the circumstances. Further, if you should subsequently receive
overt social security credits, evidence thereof will be submitted to this
organization. la such event your covert credits will be erased and your
covert deductions returned.
All other terms and conditions of said contract remain in full force
and effect.

EMPLOYEE'S WITHHOLDING EXEMPTION CERTIFICATE AND QUESTIONNAIRE
PRINT NAME (Pseudonym)
TI CILBORN, Edward 0.
WITHNOLOINS EXEMPTIONS
INSTRUCTIONS
1. NUNTER OF ENKASTIONS... Do not claim more than
the correct number of exemptions. However, if you en-
pect to ove more income tax for the year then will be
withheld if you claim every exemption to which you are
entitled, you may increase the withholding by claiming
a smaller number of exemptions.
2. CHANGES IN KAENSTIONS. You may file a new cer-
tificate at any time at the number of your exemptions
INCREASES.
You must file a new certificate within 10 days if
the number of exemptions previously claimed by you
DECREASKS for any of the following reasons:
(a) Your wife (or husband) for whom you have been
claiming exemption is divorced or legally separated,
or claims her (or hia) own exemption on a separate
certificate.
(b) The support of a dependent for whom you claimed
exemption is taken over by someone else, so that you
no longer expect to furnish more than half the support
for the year.
(c) You find that a dependent for whom you claimed
exemption will receive $600 or more of income of his
own during the year (except your child who is a student
or who is under 10 years of age).
OTHER DECREASES in exemption, such as the death of
a wife or a dependent, do not affect alt your withholding
until the next year, but require the filing of a new
certificato by December I of the year in which they
occur.
