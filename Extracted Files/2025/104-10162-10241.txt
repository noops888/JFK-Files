ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES
Reference: HABA-20512, dated 25 April 1969
1. Reference dispatch described our efforts against AEBOOR
and stated that the next phase would consist of a 24 hour a day
surveillance of Subject for a period of about two weeks. The
coverage was initiated at 0600 hours on 19 May, and terminated
at 1515 hours on 26 May, the day of AEBOOR's departure for home
leave.
2. The overall results of the surveillance effort were
interesting, and provided us with a great deal of basic data which
should prove valuable in futuro AEBOOR operational planning.
Although the period covered must be viewed as somewhat atypical
since it covered a time of preparation for homo leave, the basic
pattern could not have varied greatly from the norm. Thore wa
dofinite evasive action designed to shake surveillance taken by
AEBOOR on several occasions; there were repeat visits to several
establishments which could easily serve as lottor drops or con-
tact points; and there was an interesting contact on 21 May
(reported in BUENOS AIRES 3009) with an individual we failed to
identify positively.
3. Although the above makes it appear that we are approaching
2
-the ASBOOR peration strictly from the CI/CE angle, this is not
the case. We are attempting to gather adequate information to
give us a clear insight into AEBOOR's activities in order to holp
us attempt to introduce an access agent into this operation, or
to expand direct development of Subject by Station officers.
4. Forwarded under separato cover for Headquarters study
are copies of the surveillance roports along with a copy of the
AFLANYARD transoript for 21 May.

Operational Possibilities against ABBOOR

1. With the departure of AEBOOR and his wife on home leave,
wo would like to offer a fow comments about him for possiblu futuro
action by the Station when he returns. The impetus for these
thoughts was a recent examination of the files of a'l those Soviets
on the priority target Aist to determine if, perhaps, one of thom
offers more of a potential for intonsive development than another.
The purpose of this review was not to discard the agreed-upon targot
list, since this list is the rationale behind the entire concept
of selective targetting; but rather, to attempt a narrowing of the
Station's focus on the one particular Sovics who appears to be the
best selection for operational devolopment among the priority group.
We have looked at such factors as susceptibilities (known or
potontial), contaces, accessibility, etc. and, for reasons discussod
below, that AEBOOR may be the best solection for a determined
Station offort aimed at his eventual recruitmont. Thus, the Station's
focus on the other priority Soviets would continue at its prosent
lovel but at the same time, AlEBOOR would be placed "under the
microscopo" as the object of a more intonsive Station offort aimed
as gaining multiple accoss to him.
2. With the imminent departure of BIBANDIT/12 from Buenos
Airoo and the resulting elimination of our one good contact wich
ABVULTURD, the choice of ANBOOR became casior to make. His saloction,
however, was based on several considerations which, from our
vantage point, seem to offer the best potential fur Station action
when he returns to the country.

Accessibility: ABDOOR is one of the very few Soviets
with whom direct Stuffer contact has been made. The social
evening spone with him and his wife in January showed excellent
promiso because it appeared that foundations for rapport and
further contacs had been laid. We note, however, that thero
has been no mention further moetings since the initial one,
four and one-half months ago. Due to the clapsed time, we
assume that Subiect and his wife are not planning to rociprocato

again and instigate a second meeting soon after Subject
returns from home leave. Since there are no other access
agents now in touch with Subject, the potential for assess-
ment of our target personality by direct Staffer contact
becomes crucial in the selective targotting procedure.
Through the advantages of direct assessment, we should be
able to make a good judgment concerning the susceptibilities
(or lack thereof) of ALBOOR and accordingly, determine the
value in pursuing him as a priority target.
b. The impressions of AEBOOR and his wife from the one
meeting thusfar seem to offer some possible avenues of approach
which the Station may wish to consider in their planning. The
wife, in particular, was described as being more relaxed than
ABBOOR and through her professed interest in theatre, music.
and ballet, it might be possible for Nina T. MARGANDE to
exploit this interest and invite her to selected cultural
events. If ALBOOR does not share his wife's proclivitios
for the "arts", then she might appreciate the presence of a
female comnanton who shares her interests. AbBOOR's wife
also claimed to like both American songs and dancing. This
too, might open the door to some form of imaginative approach
built around a future invitation whereby the incipient social
relationship of 9 January would be further developed in the
depth needed for a thorough assessment of the target. Culti-
vation of the wife appears to be particularly appropriate
because of the apparent conflicts and tensions between her
and her husband. The accounts of this relationship from ther
previous tour in Mexico and also the current transcripts from
ABLANYARD paint a picture of an irascible and foul-mouthed
husband constantly doing battle with a domineering wife. It
seems likely that the impression of "sweetness and light" waich
they generated during their evening with the Station case
officers was atypical and manufactured for the benefit of
their hosts. This, of course, is natural with most couples
who choose not to air their personal differences in public,
but from our point of view, this lack of harmony between
ABBOOR and his wife offers distinct possibilities for the
Station to contact the wife independentiy and offer her welcome
diversions from the regimented and turbulent life with her
husband. (We call your attention to the reference since it
may provide some useful points in devising an approach to
ABBOOR's wife). Their present home leave in the USSR would
seem to offer a ready-made situation for renewed contact when
they return since natural curiosity about their activities
and time spent at home could be sufficient grounds for an
invitation either to both or singly to spend an evening together.
We offer those thoughts only because they appear to us as good
opportunities not only to maintain Staffor contact with a
target of priority interest, but to also develop this contact
further te the degree of intimacy nooded for a recognition
and ultimatic exploitation of his susceptibilities.
A
3.
a. Since there are no access agents now in touch with
ARBOOR, we suggest, as a supplement to the direct Staffor
contact and in order to obtain additional assessments of Subject
from other angles, the Station consider "running" a controlled
anset into ALBOOR under suitably contrived circumstances. In
other words, we would crente a relationship where none pre-
viously existed, By this device, we are not suggesting a double
agent operation in which our agent offers himself for recruit-
monts on the contrary, the rationale is simply to move a
controlled asset into the path of the target and attempt to
estabilan a contact through a common bond of social or business
Interests. If we agree that ALBOOK can be brought under a acre
Intensive scruetiny than the other soviets, then this ploy
would be a logical step in his development as a recruitment
target if additional access to him is non-existent.

d. AVDEPTH: The ability to monitor AEBOOR through this
technical operation was a key factor in deciding to bring him
under closer focus. it should be able to provide the necessary
depth to any human assessment of the target and it gives us the
singular opportunity to "observe" AEBOOR when he is relaxed at
home and not exhibiting the official mannerisms and personality
which he must display in public and around his other Soviet
colleagues. If we are able to expand the burgeoning Staffer
contact with Subject as well as place access agents in touch
with him, then his reactions to these contacts can be monitored
and our moves against him tailored accordingly.
3. As part of the total effort to build up a large amount of
information on the selected target, we are including as an attachment,
a copy of the new Personality Characteristic Questionnairo (PCQ) with
instructions for its use. By employing it in conjunction with your
direct assessment of ALBOOR, we should be able to slowly build up
onough information on him so that the indirect psychological assess-
mont techniquécan also be applied. The PCQ is a now form and less
time-consuming than others but we believe it should be an integral part
of the entire assessment process focused on a target Soviet and that
it can be an invaluable aid in attempting to evaluate the varied
impressions of the target which have been obtained from multiple
access to him. An initial review of the PCQ may give the impression
that many of the questions are irrelevant and have no bearing on the
determination of a persons susceptibility to manipulation. The
questionnaire should not be perused piecemeal, however, but taken in
its entirety since each portion will be interpreted and weighted by
the indirect psychological assessment techniques until a very complete
impression of the total personality emerges. We encourage the Station
to wailise the PCQ and when sufficiently complete, forward it to
Headquarters for evaluation.
A
4. Once again, we wish to emphasize that leadquarters is in a
position to offer guidance and support support to your efforts, but the
direction of the case rests with the Station. The case officer
involved is in the best spot to fudge the progress of the case and
make decisions accordingly. For this reason, we encourage a continu-
ous end candid dialogue, concerning the various aspects of your
operations against the selected Soviet targets in order to insure
professional development of each caso. If our choice of ABBOOR is
ag variance with your on-the-spot assessment of the priority Soviets,
thon we would appreciate your appraisal of him as well as any
suggestions about a more logical candidate fox closer focus..

then I/you/we can talk about gratitude. But now? There's chaos
all around! And you talk about gratitude... ((She sounds incensed))
Everywhere there is (10)." C. tries to convince her, "Roza!

B. telle her husband, "Sit, sit, all right!" C. continues trying
to convince B. that she shouldn't insult her husband.
A bit further, B. tells C. irritably, "He piles everything
on me. You're blaming me, right?" C. continues telling B. to
treat her husband better, and says, "I love my Galka very much,
and I nee that Ivan loves ((you)). I am firmly convinced of that."
B. Laurhn aaronationlly. 0. adds, "(XG) that means to indulge

"What do you want to do -- do you want to see/think of your husband

If Galka would throw me out, I wouldn't become a scoundrel any way.
Ispit on that. No matter what anybody says about me, I won't

Further, C. telle B. about an incident which occurred

been given ingredients to make meat pastries (piroshki), and that
