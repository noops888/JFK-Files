RECORD NUMBER : 180-10068-10303
RECORD SERIES : STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS
AGENCY FILE NUMBER :
December 8, 1995
Status of Document:
Postponed in Part
Number of releases of previously postponed information: 10
Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors
including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the
absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.
Number of Postponements: 5
Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.
Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could
reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of
privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

CAPITOL HILL EXPERIENCE:
Washington, D. C.
202-546-4912
January July, 1971--Glenn M. Anderson of California
Joined staff as secretary to the administrative assistant, Harry
Anderson. Stayed here only six months because I did not find the
work challenging and was losing my skills because I was not using
them enough. Salary was approximately $6,800 to $7,400.
September, 1971 September, 1975--Office of the Legislative Counsel
Was member of the secretarial pool taking a great deal of shorthand
and typing from 25-30 attorneys. This job was extremely demanding
but was also excellent experience. I left a bit reluctantly to go
to school.
December, 1975
November, 1976--Richard F. Vander Veen of Michigan
Became member of this staff on a part-time basis. My duties involved
typing letters composed by entire staff except administrative assistant.
Here again, as in the Counsel, I had responsibility for a great deal of
typing, but less shorthand than before. I learned how to work two kinds
of automatic typewriters and was responsible for using them for large-
volume mailings. Left staff after this seat turned over after election.
Salary approximately $6,500 for a twenty hour week.
PRIOR TO HILL EXPERIENCE:
March, 1970 January, 1971--Shering Pharmaceutical Company
Secretary for two product managers, John Moser and Toby Madison. Had
many different responsibilities: filing, typing, shorthand, telephone
calling and answering, making reservations for overseas trips and in-
country trips, and greating business clients. Enjoyed this job greatly.
Salary approximately $6,400.
