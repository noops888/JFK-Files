OCCURRENCE: In a Presidential meeting on Vietnam with the CIA participants
being McCone and Colby the record by Colby reflects that McNamarra pointed out that
Lodge has little contact with Diem and has not been out of Saigon. Mr. McCone commented
that he believed that we should move cautiusly, that we should talk seriously to Diem
and that Lodge should be urged to visit the countryside to obtain a more realistic
view of the effects of suspending aid. Mr. McCone also suggested that another approach
be made to Nhu to seek his cooperation ina departure. The President asked whether we
had carefully studied the detail effects of cuts in aid (as proposed in a paper prepared
by Hillsman). It was evident that the effects had not been studies. The President
asked DOD and CIA to analyze the Hillsman paper. He also asked that a telegram be sent
to Lodge asking him to try to reduce the press leakage from Saigon and to establish some
real contact with Diem. Any current plans for aid negotiation should be stalled, and the
PresidenOURCEould be well informed of any steps taken in this contex TAFFsuch as the
instance involving CIA payment to Col Tung last week.

OCCURRENCE: On or about October 5, 1963 when the telegram of October 5 and 6 were sent
to Saigon, MC CONE was called over by PRESIDENT KENNEDY and met privately with PRESIDENT
KENNEDY and the Attorney General, ROBERT F. KENNEDY, and took the position that the CIA
should take a hands off position as far as the assassination of DIEM was concerned. MC CONE
"felt that the President agreed with my position, despite the fact that he had great reser-
vations concerning DIEM and his conduct. I urged him to try to bring all the pressure we
could on DIEM to change his ways, to encourage more support throughout the country. My pre-
cise words to the President, and I remember them very clearly, was that Mr. President, if I
was manager of a baseball team, I had one pitcher, I'd keep him in the box whether he was a
good pitcher or not. By that I was saying that, if DIEM was removed we would have not one
coup, but we would have a succession of coups and political disorder in Vietnam, and it might
last several years as indeed it did. So it was for that reason that I felt there would be

OCCURRENCE: On October 5, 1963, MC CONE sent, to some locations, including SAIGON the
following message: "Believe assassination discussions most careful handling. In general
best line is no line so that it is clear that we are sticking to position of having no
responsibility for actions of any of various contending Vietnamese groups. We certainly can-
not be in the position of stimulating, approving, or supporting assassination, but on the
other hand, we are in no way responsible for stopping every such threat of which we might
receive even partial knowledge. We certainly would not favor assassination of DIEM. We be-
lieve in gaging ourselves by taking position on this matter opens door too easily for probes
of our position re others, re support of regime, etc. Consequently, believe best approach
is hands off. However, we naturally interested in intelligence on any such plan. This mes-
sage has been cleared with State Department."

there was going to be a coup d'etat, that they didn't want this to be an American sponsored
coup d'etat, they wanted to be assured of American backing, specifically in the part where
it comes to military and economic aid after the coup had been successful." p. 24 "What the
GENERAL meant, he actually did not want U.S. participation in the coup d'etat. He did not
want the U.S. government to start the coup d'etat. He also outlined three general ideas,
this was the first time that a leader had mentioned the possibility of assassination. This
assassination was not of DIEM. This was if they could not do anything, it would be the
elimination of NGO DINH CAN, who was the war lord in central Vietnam and NGO DINH NHU.
that time GENERAL MINH did say that one of the alternative means was to eliminate CAN and
NHU and keep DIEM." That was one of the alternatives. p. 25

On August 29, 1963, the following report was listed within the Saigon Station's chronology
of August 1963 coup activities as follows:
"At 0745 hours, RICHARDSON, SPERA and CONEIN, latter two of whom were scheduled to contact
GENERALS MINH and KHIEM at 0815 same morning, were shown a message from GENERAL TAYLOR to
GENERAL HARKINS stating aspects of Vietnam situation being reviewed at WHITE HOUSE and com-
menting that second thoughts were beginning in Washington. Faced with this information and
given strictly limited time factors, RICHARDSON decided that the meeting with GENERALS MINH
and KHIEM should not be postponed but that contacting officers would make this meeting a
fact-finding mission without encouraging or discouraging GENERAL MINH.
"When SPERA and CONEIN returned from their meeting with KHIEM and MINH, (con't.)
