General:
Arms smuggling is one of the "facts of life" in Latin
America and has been engaged in by dissident elements for many years..
Reports of Castro involvement in these activities have been frequent since
Aly after his seizure of power early in 1959. None of these reports

The U.S. aras furnished under the MAP to forser Cuban
those collected by Castro provide the Castro
it with large stocks which could be shipped to subversive groups
her countries. Identification of these arms with Cuba would be
extremoly difficult.

An arms cache of weapons and ammunition recently discovered at the
Idgas Camponesas guerrilla training center in the interior of the
Brasilien state of Goias is believed by US Embassy and CAS officers to
be of Brazilien rather than Cuban arms, despite a Brazilien newspaper
suggestion that they were Cuben. There were also discovered about 125
copies of Communist publications including Che Guevara's well-known
treatise on "Querrilla Warfare". The training center was described as
organized according to that book. A confidential report on the discoveries
added that "members of the center went to be the Brazilian equivalent
of those who fought in the Bierre Maestra and so bring the hard Chinese-
Cuban type revolution to Brazil." Some 90 to 95 persons in the locality
are reported members of or sympathetic to the Ligas Camponesas activities,
but only 2 of the 24 for whom warrents were issued have yet been taken
into custody. (Am Emb, Rio de Janeiro 1122, 10 December, CONFIDENTIAL,

Soviet fishing boats, under cover of fishing Atlantic waters,
are transporting contraband arms to Latin American countries.
The boats are met outside the territorial waters of those
countries, and arms are transferred in small quantities.
On board the Soviet boats are only Soviets and a very few
Cubans or other Latin Americans who talk with those who
pick up the arms. The arms being delivered are of American
manufacture, including those obtained during the Batista
regime and those taken during the Playa Giron invasion. The
Soviet fishing boats also carry propaganda and pamphlets
containing, military instructions, the same type of material
being sent by diplomatic pouch from Mexico.
:
A Belgian in Habana who says he represents a Belgian firm,
has offered the Cuban Government any type and nationality
of arms for payment in dollars. The Belgian has made a
similar offer of sale of arms to a representative of an
anti-Castro group in Habana.
3. In August 1962 a fisherman in Santiago de Cuba said that
on several occasions he had been forced by the Government
to use his boat for transporting small groups of men, in
civilian clothes, and supplies of arms. He also knew of
other fishermen who had been forced to do the same. The men
and arms were carried to small islands or transferred to other
boats at sea. Such trips sometimes lasted as long as four or
five days. The fisherman did not know the purpose or final
destination of the men and arms.

Venezuela Uncovers Communist Arms Cacne-
The Venezuelan Government
in a raid on a small
village near Caracas on 5 January -- uncovered a
large cache of arms and equipment which it claims
belonged to the pro-Castro Armed Forces of National
Liberation, reputed to be emerging as a para-

Several tons of explosives and large quantities
of hand bombs, arms, and ammunition were seized as well

The British consul in Santiago de Cuba has informed Washington
and the Governor of British Guiana that two alleged US citizens,
John Allrem Johnson, aged 53, and his wife Margaret Frances Johnson,
were leaving Cuba on 31 December on the Cuban vessel BAHIA DE TANAMA
destined for Georgetown, British Guiana. On board with them were 17
cases in their name, including two large wood crates understood to be
"very similar to those recently unloaded from a Soviet Union ship
in Sentiago de Cuba." The British consul notes the unlikelihood of
US citizens' lesving Cuba in this manner, and the resulting doubt as to
their real identities and intentions. (British Foreign Office to

A number of high-ranking Cuban leaders since the first of
the year have publicly called for revolution in other Latin
American countries, with Venezuela singled out as a country
with top priority.
Coinciding with these appeals have been reports that the
Venezuelan Communist Party (PCV) planned to step up terrorist
activity to discredit President Betancourt before his US
visit. The recent incidence of terrorism, which has included
attacks on the US Chamber of Commerce office building and the
burning of Sears, Roebuck warehouses, is apparently part
of this campaign.
Involved in the current terrorism is the Armed Forces of
National Liberation (FALN). The FALN, although purporting to
represent all of the opposition, includes some prominent
Communists and is emerging as a paramilitary force of the PCV
with its main strength in the Caracas area.
Guerrilla bands also operate in western Venezuela, but
there is no firm evidence that their activity is coordinated
with that in the Caracas area. Venezuelan army units, with
air support, have been used in a recent campaign against
these guerrillas.
The armed forces are generally capable of maintaining
internal security and of defending the nation's borders
against neighboring countries. The vast majority supports
constitutionality and is loyal to the Betancourt government.
The armed forces would not hesitate, however, to take over the
government in order to maintain order or to forestall a
Communist uprising. The armed forces were earlier greatly
frustrated over the government's inaction against Communist-
instigated disorders. Betancourt's recent willingness to
take more vigorous action, however, coupled with the strong
support given the US during the Cuban crisis, has overcome
much of this dissatisfaction, and armed forces' support of
the government is greater now than it was six months ago.
The officer corps is generally free of Communist
penetration, although there has been some infiltration in the
Marine corps, two or three battalions having been involved
in leftist-led revolts during the spring of 1962.
