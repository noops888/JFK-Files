ADDENDUM TO FOOTNOTE # 614 OF "LEE HARVEY OSWALD, THE CIA
AND MEXICO CITY.
Some controversy has arisen in regard to the question
of whether the tapes existed at the time of the assass-
ination due to a memorandum from J. Edgar Hoover to the
head of the Secret Service which said:
The Central Intelligence Agency advised that
on October 1, 1963, an extremely sensitive
source had reported that an individual iden-
tified himself as Lee Oswald, who contacted the
Soviet Embassy in Mexico City inquiring as to
any messages. Special Agents of this Bureau,
who have conversed with Oswald in Dallas,
Texas, have observed photographs of the indi-
vidual referred to above and have listened to
a recording of his vcice. These Special Agents
are of the opinion that the above-referred-to
individual was not Lee Harvey Oswald.
(Memorandum from Hoover to James J. Rowley, 11/23/63,
pp. 4-5.) The HSCA has determined that this statement
was probably based on ancther FBI memorandum which said:
Inasmuch as the Dallas Agents who listened to the
tape of the conversation allegedly of Oswald
from the Cuban Embassy to the Russian Embassy in
Mexico and examined the photographs of the visitor
to the Embassy in Mexico and were of the opinion
that neither the tape nor the photograph pertained
to Oswald, I requested Shanklin to immediately
send a photograph of Oswald to our Legal Attache.
(Memorandum from Belmont to Tolson, 11/23/63, p. 1. Mr.
Belmont was reporting the results of a conversation with
the Special Agent in Charge in Dallas, Gordon Shanklin,
that occured at 11:50 A.M.)

ADDENDUM: Page Two.
Later that same day SAC Shanklin informed the Director
that the tape of Oswald's voice had been erased: "It
should be noted that the actual tape from which this
transcript was made has been erased." (Teletype from
SAC Dallas to Director, # 232220, 7:30 P.M. CST, 11/23/63.
Emphasis in the original.)
The confusion about whether or not there was a tape
apparently continued for several days after the SAC in
Dallas informed the Director that such a tape did not
exist. On 11/25/63 the FBI Legat in Mexico City sent a
Cablegram to the director which said:
There appears to be some confusion in that no
tapes were taken to Dallas but only typewritten
transcripts supplied by CIA, the tapes not being
available because they had been erased.
(Cablegram # 182 & 183, F. 2.)
The FBI was asked to explain the paragraph from the
Hoover memorandum quoted above. It responded:
The paragraph appearing on pages 4 and 5 of the
leterhead memorandum, which is quoted in your
(FBI) request of March 17, 1978, contains some
incorrect informatior regarding a tape recording
of the voice of an individual who identified him-
self as Lee Oswald.
Retrievable information contained in files
of the FBI indicates that this Bureau received
information derived from transcripts of tape
recordings furnished by another government
agency which conducts intelligence type inves-

tigations. The transcripts indicated that on
September 28, 1963, and October 1, 1963, the
voice of an individual identifying himself as
Lee Oswald was recorded by the other govern-
ment agency conducting intelligence type inves-
tigations. Additionally, this government agency
provided the FBI with photographs of an individ-
ual who appeared to be an American; these photo-
graphs being taken by said agency on October 1,
1963.
It is noted that the FBI never received the
actual tape recordings from which the transcripts
were derived, as the tapes were erased by the
other government agency providing the transcripts....
As a result, no FBI employee ever listened to a
tape recording purporting to contain Lee Harvey
Oswald's voice as no tape was ever provided to
this Bureau.
(JFK Classified Document # 131.) No FBI agent interviewed
by the Committee recalled listening to any tape recording
purporting to contain a corversation involving Oswald.

A. Issues Addressed
copy #s of 3
The House Select Committee on Assassinations'
investigation into Lee Harvey Oswald's activities in Mexico City
has been directed at answering the following questions:
2000666
1) Did Lee Harvey (swald visit the Soviet and
Cuban Consulates or Embassies in Mexico City?
2) In addition to he visits which may have been
made to the Embassies, what were Lee Harvey
Oswald's activities while he was in Mexico City?
3) Was Lee Harvey Oswald alone in Mexico City?
If not, who were his associates and what were
their activities?
4) Did the Central Intelligence Agency maintain
any surveillance operation(s) aimed at the
Cuban and Soviet diplomatic missions in
Mexico City? If so, what kind?
5) What information, if any, about Oswald's
stay in Mexico City was known by the CIA
Mexico City Staion prior to the

B. Differences Between the Warren Commission
Investigation of Lee Harvey Oswald's
Activities in Mexico City and the House
Select Committee on Assassination's
Investigation.
The approach taken by this Committee's investigation
differs from that of the Warren Commission primarily
in terms of scope. The Warren Commission and the
investigative agencies at its disposal went to
great lengths to establish Oswald's travel to and
from Mexico, but devoted minimal effort to
evaluating Oswald's contacts with the Cuban and
Soviet Consulates. It is the conclusion of this
Committee that the Warren Commission correctly
established that Oswald hac traveled to Mexico
City. Hence, this Committee has chosen not to
reinvestigate Oswald's travel to and from Mexico City.
Instead, the Committee's approach has been to focus
narrowly an Oswald's contacts with the Soviet and
Cuban diplomatic missionsn Mexico City and on
evidence that was not available to the Warren
the Warren

--
Commission that could possibly shed light on
Oswald's activities in Mexico City outside of the
Soviet and Cuban installations.
The Warren Report limited its discussion of
Oswald's contacts with the Soviet and Cuban diplomatic
missions to information obtained from Sylvia Duran
and the Cuban Government.1/
At one point in the Report the Commission referred
to other information:
By far the most important confirmation
of Senora Duran's testimony, however, has been
supplied by confidentia sources of extremely high
reliability available to the United States in
Mexico. The information from these sources
establishes that her testimony was truthful and
accurate in all materia respects. The identities
of these sources cannot be disclosed without
destroying their future usefulness to the
United States.2/
The Warren Commission did not print anything in
the twenty-six volumes of evidence to support
its statement that Silvia Duran's testimony was
confirmed by "confidential sources of extremely
high reliability."

In an attempt to answer the questions posed by
Lee Harvey Oswald's visit to Mexico City in September
and October of 1963, the House Select Committee on
Assassinations has pursued the following investigative
procedure:
1) Conducted extensive interviews, depositions,
and executive session hearings involving
Central Intelligence Agency personnel;
2) Interviewed Cuban citizens who could have
knowledge of Oswald's sojourn in Mexico;
3) Interviewed Mexican citizens who could have
knowledge of Oswald's activites and
associations while he was in Mexico;
4) Conducted an extensive review of the files
of the Central Intelligence Agency and the
Federal Bureau of Investigation that
pertain to Oswald and Mexico City.
C. Conclusions
1) Someone who identified himself as
Lee Harvey Oswald called the Soviet

individual indicated that he had
visited the Soviet Consulate at least
once. Other evidence from the CIA
wiretaps, and witness testimony, indicates
that the individual visited the Soviet
and Cuban Consulates on five or six
different occasions. While the
majority of the evidence tends to
indicate that this individual was indeed
Lee Harvey Oswald, the possibility that
someone else used Lee Harvey Oswald's
name during this time in contacts with
the Soviet and Cuban Consulates cannot
be absolutely dismissed.
2) This Committee has not been able to
determine Lee Harvey Oswald's activities
outside of the Cuban and Soviet Embassies
with certainty. There is a report, which
has not been confirmed, indicating that
during his stay in Mexico Oswald attended
a "twist party" at the home of Ruben
Duran Navarro, the brother-in-law of

Silvia Duran. There is also unconfirmed
evidence which, if true, would indicate
that Oswald, spert one night and parts of
two days with a group of pro-Castro
students from the University of Mexico.
3) There is a report that Oswald may have
been in the company of a tall, thin,
blond-headed mar while in Mexico. This
repanet has not been confirmed. If
true, it is possible that this same
individual may, on occasion, have used
Oswald's name in dealing with the Cuban
and Soviet Consulates. The man's name,
if there was such a man, is not known.
4) On the dates that Oswald was in Mexico,
the CIA had photographic surveillance
operations which covered entrances to
the Soviet Embassy and the Cuban Embassy
and Consulate. The CIA also had electronic
surveillance on telephones in the Soviet
Consulate and Military Attache's Office
and Cuban diplomatic compounds. The

telephone at the Cuban Consulate was not
subject to that surveillance.
5) The CIA's Mexico City Station definitely
knew of Oswald's contacts with both the
Soviet and Cuban diplomatic compounds
and of his desire to obtain an intransit
visa for travel to Russia via Cuba.
The source of this information was the
electronic surveillance on the Soviet
Consulate and Soviet Military Attache's
Office.
6) All information n the possession of the
CIA Mexico City Station was not reported
to CIA Headquarers in an accurate and
expeditious manner prior to the assassination.
7) With the except on of a few, possibly
benign, irregularities, and considering
the possibility that not all of the
information ava lable to the Station has
been provided to this Committee, the
information in the possession of the
CIA Mexico Station was reported in an

accurate and expeditious manner after
the assassination to headquarters.
8) With the exception of those areas that
involved sensitive sources and methods,
such as the information pertaining to the
electronic and photographic surveillance
of the Soviet and Cuban diplomatic
compounds, information developed by
the CIA in Mexico was generally relayed
to the Warren Commission in an accurate
and expeditious manner.
9) It is the conclusion of this Committee
that the CIA's photo-surveillance
operations in Mexico City probably
obtained a photograph of Lee Harvey
Oswald entering either or both the
Soviet and Cuban Consulates. The CIA
denies that such a photograph exists.
Hence, the dispostion of this photograph
is unknown.

10) The CIA telephore surveillance on the Sov-
iet Embassy taped several calls of a man
using the name 'Lee Oswald." These tapes
were retained for a routine two week period
and were most likely erased shortly after
16 October 1963. These tapes were probably
not in
existence at the time of the assassination.
11) The Committee is aware of the allegations
that Silvia Tirado de Duran may have been
an intelligence agent for either the Cubans,
Mexicans or Americans. Ms. Duran was pro-
bably never employed by Cuban intelligence.
While there is no direct evidence on the
question other han Ms. Duran's denial, the
Committee believes that the circumstantial
evidence that tends to indicate that Ms.
Duran had a relationship of some type with
either Mexican or American intelligence is
of such a nature that the possibility can
not be dismissed.

D. Structure and Relevancy
The following report detailing the results
of this Committee's investigative efforts regarding
Mexico City is divided into general areas:
1) CIA surveillance operations in Mexico
City during September and October of
1963;
2) Information about Lee Harvey Oswald's
stay in Mexico City that was known prior
to the assassination;
3) Reconstruction cf the CIA Mexico City
Station and Heacquarters activity
regarding Oswald prior to the assassination;
4) Mexico City repcrting of information
after the assassination;
5) Witnesses from the Cuban Consulate;
6) Investigation of related information
that was not available to the Warren
Commission; and
7) Reconstruction of Oswald's activities
in Mexico City.

that the first section following is technical in
nature and may not appear cirectly relevant at
first blush. But the report is cumulative in nature.
The specific, detailed analyses of the standard
operating procedures in the first section are
necessary to, and form a partial basis for, the
reconstruction of the Mexico City Station's
handling of the Oswald case. There are many gaps
left by the documentary and testimonial evidence
concerning the manner in which the CIA's Mexico
City Station and Headquarters reacted to Oswald's
presence in Mexico City. A knowledge of the
way in which the Mexico City Station operated and
the procedures involved in those surveillance
operations which detected Oswald is valuable in
filling the gaps of the specific case which is the
subject of this report.

the technician had been responsible for maintaining
liaison between the agents inside the base and the
Station. After the agent's training was completed,
