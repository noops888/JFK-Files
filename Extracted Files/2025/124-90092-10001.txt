LSECRET,
THOMPSON stated that this individual's face was
somewhat familiar, and that the name definitely was
familiar to him. THOMPSON identified this individual as
a Captain HARVEY, whose name appeared on communications
directed to OSI from the 7983rd Army Unit 5 Specifically,
THOMPSON remembered that Captain HARVEY'shame had appeared
on name check requests submitted to OSI Berlin, from the
7983rd Army Unit.S THOMPSON believed that the Soviets either
Showed THOMPSON a picture of HARVEY or asked THOMPSON
about HARVEY. THOMPSON stated that he furnished whatever
available information he had about HARVEY to the Soviets,
but he could not now recall the nature of this information,
