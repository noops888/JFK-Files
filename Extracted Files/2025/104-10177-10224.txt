SUBJECT: UNINTEL CKTOP JAGUAR/IVAN DMITRIYEVICH OBYEDKOV 1201-779495)
REF: LONDON 81224 IN 2003461 4
1. OBYEDKOV ACTED AS A GUARD AT THE SOVIET EMBASSY IN MEXICO
CITY, ALTHOUGH HE APPEARED TO BE BETTER EDUCATED THAN HIS DUTIES AS
A GUARD WOULD DEMAND. AMONG HIS MAIN DUTIES, HE TENDED THE SOVIET
EMBASSY TELEPHONE, STOOD GUARD DUTY AT THE GATE, TOOK MESSAGES FOR SEN
OTHER SOVIETS, NOTIFIED THEN OF MEETINGS, AND ARRANGED APPOINTMENTS.
HE ALSO OCCASIONALLY DROVE ONE OF THE EMBASSY CARS ON ERRANDS.
DURING HIS TEHRAN TOUR, HE WAS ALSO LISTED AS A GUARD AT THE SOVIET
EMBASSY. HE WAS OBSERVED TO BE VERY SECURITY CONSCIOUS. 4
2. ON BOTH PRECEDING TOURS OBYEDKOV APPEARED TO FUNCTION AS A
LEGITIMATE GUARD AND WAS NEVER OBSERVED IN THE ACT OF PERFORMING
ANY INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE A SOVIET IS LISTED AS A GUARD
AT A SOVIET EMBASSY, IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT HE IS NECESSARILY A
KGB OFFICER. SINCE WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT AN INTELLIGENCE
AFFILIATION WE WILL NO LONGER CARRY HIM AS SUSPECT RIS, PROBABLY KGB.

MICROFILM
1. For your information, we no longer carry Ivan Dmitriyevich OBVEDKOV
(201-779495), guard at the Soviet Embassy in Tehran, as PCS. He was not listed
on ROGWEN's April 1971 Presence List nor their December 1971 list. We assume
he has departed PCS.
2. During OBYEDKOV's tour in Tehran his wife, Yelena, served as principal
at the Soviet school. His son was apparently in Moscow living with Yelena's mother.
On 23 October 1969, ROARC reported the grandmother calling to check with OBYEDKOV
regarding a tutor for the child. They discussed the possibility of the tutor coming
for three times a week, at five rubles per hour, but OBYEDKOV, after checking with
his wife, decided on two times a week. OBYEDKOV seemed to be very fond of his
mother-in-law. According to our AESCREEN transcriber, she was the only one that
could tell OBYEDKOV what to do.
3. The following are comments made by our AESCREEN transcriber on OBYEDKOV
on 8 July 1970:
He is very security conscious, especially in dealing with "official people" or
superiors. He mentions his name to his friends freely, but refuses to say his name
when he knows that one of the superiors is calling, "this is the duty officer" OBYEDKOV
would say several times. He often lectures people when they violate security regulations
when talking on the telephone. OBYEDKOV has to be persuaded several times or even

begged if someone needs help (getting a vehicle or when asking for a favor), but when
he decides to help, OBYEDKOV will say with the problem until he gets results.
Although OBYEDKOVA seeras to be more cultured and better educated than her
husband, it is certain that only OBYEDKOV makes the final decisions. OBYEDKOV
could be very pleasant, helpful and even kind, but it usually depended on his mood.
5. The only Soviet we noted as being friendly with OBYEDKOV during his tour
here was Rafik Nazhaf-Ogly ABDULLAYEV (201-808524), Third Secretary, suspect
RIS, probable KGB. When speaking to one another they used the familiar "ty".
We do not know the extent of their relationship.
4. Forwarded herewith is a photograph, date unknown, received from ROGWEN.
We have destroyed the Station file.

passport: S-105043 issued 26 May 1967
occupation: guard, Soviet Embassy, Tehran
arrived: 15 August 1967.
Photocopies of the OBYEDKOVS passports are attached.
2. According to the 1963 and 1964 Checklists of Soviet Officials Abroad,
one Ivan Ivanovich OBYEDKOV (201-121531); born 14 July 1912; wire Yelena;
A number 04377, was present in Mexico City since August 1962 as an employee
of the Soviet Embassy. The. Checklist for 1965, lists one Ivan Dmitriyevich
OBYEDKOV (201-779495); born 14 July 1912; wife Yelena; A number 41970, as an
employee of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City since August 1962. Apparently
these two OBYEDKOVS are one in the same and although Subject's birthdate is
different we believe he is identical with the OBYEDKOV who served in Mexico City.
Recently a conversation was recorded on ROARC during waich Subject used several
Spanish words and expressions. It is possible Subject acquired a knowledge of
Spanish during a previous tour in a Spanish speaking country such as Mexico.
Please compare the attached photo of Subject with that of the OBYEDKOV who was
assigned to Mexico City to determine if they are identical.

Paragraph 20 of the Summary is for passage to liaison.
2.. Subject is not identical to Ivan Ivanovich OBYLDKOV
(201-121531). When Subject first arrived in Mexico in August 1962,
he was reported as Ivan Ivanovich and this orror was not corrected
until May 1905; therefore, two Checklists carried the wrong aan
PCS in Mexico. When the records were corrected, the Subject's
birthdate was not, and the same date was listed for both parties.
Headquarters records do not list a wife or other dependents for
Ivan Ivanovich OBYDKOV and, as far as is known, he has not been
assigned abroad PCS prior to the date of this dispatch.

10. PERSONALITY, CHARACTER, AND HABITS:
Although Subject acted as a guard at the Soviet Embassy
in Mexico, he appeared to be fairly well educated and was
not subservient to any of the other Soviets, with the
exception of Counselor Boris Aleksandrovich KAZANTSEV.
(201-028975). On one occasion Subject was reported to be
helping the daughter of Commercial Counselor Georgiy
Stepanovich VISKO with her arithmetic homework. On another,
Subject was asked about methods of producing metal wire,
a subject on which Subject was well informed as a result of
his having once worked for a wire factory.
Subject had a tape recorder at home which he liked to
listen to. lle also occasionally went fishing with other Soviets..
Subject told "Boris" in Moscow to build a large garage,
because he was bringing a big car back with him. He also
asked whether Boris had bought a refrigerator and TV for the
apartment. On another occasion he was negotiating for a can
of paint to take back to Moscow with him to repaint "the
Moskvich". Subject and his wife were both buying watches
just before leaving Mexico. From the above it appears
that Subject was fairly well-off financially, for a guard.

CURRICULUM VITAE:
Date unknown

(wire) factory in Leningrad.
28 August 1962
Subject, accompanied by wife and son, arrived
PCS in Mexico as an employee of the Soviet
Embassy. Subject replaced Vyacheslav
Aleksandrovich YEGOROV (201-273431), who

12. INTELLIGENCE AFFILIATION:
Mexico City Station considers Subject suspect RIS because
he appears better educated that his duties as a guard would
demand, because he seems financially better off than other
Soviet guards and because of his apparent association on
equal footing with Soviet RIS officers. DERYABIN in 1955
advised LNERGO that the surname OBYEDKOV was familiar to him
as the name of a person who was in the Guards Directorate of
the MVD in 1951.
In September 1967 DERYABIN and RASTVOROV said that they
neither recognized the face nor the name of the Subject.
(Both Ivan Ivanovich and Ivan Dmitriyevich were seen by the
defectors and they did not recognize either of them.)
13. INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY:
There was no intelligence activity noted on the Subject's
part while he was stationed in Mexico.
14. NON-INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY:
Subject primarily handled the main Soviet telephone and
took guard duty at the gate. Subject took messages for other
Soviets, notified them of meetings, and contacted them for
appointments with each other. He occasionally drove one of

the Embassy cars on errands. ile kept a ledger of the telegrams
sent out by the Embassy and notified other Soviets when cables
came in for them.

CONTACTS:
a.
Soviet friends and associates.
1. Valeriy Aleksandrovich ANDRIANOV (201-293945),
employee in the Soviet Trade Representation in
Mexico from February 1961 to May 1964, suspect
RIS. When the ANDRIANOVS left Mexico they were
planning to get in touch with Subject's family
in Moscow.
2.
Aleksandr Mikhaylovich DENISOV (201-726491), Second
Secretary at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico from
August 1962 to April 1967, known GRU. Subject
appeared not to like DENISOV. It also appeared
that DENISOV was responsible for reimbursing
Subject for the gas Subject used in KUKHARENKO's
саг.
3. Aleksey Nikolayevich GANIN (201-757775), known GRU
officer who visited Mexico 31 July 14 August 1964.

Subject, along with other Soviets who were
known GRU officers, met GAVIN on his visit to
Mexico.
Sergey Semenovich KUKHARENKO (201-260831), chief
of the Soviet information Bulletin in Mexico from
October 1962 to August 1964, suspect KGB. Subject
and KUKHARENKO were the best of friends for a
time, but ther KUKHARENKO began drinking too
much and getting into various scrapes. Subject
frequently commiserated with KUKHARENKO's wife
over her husband's drinking, automobile accidents,
money problems.
Subject occasionally used
KUKHARENKO's car..
5. Oleg Pavlovich MOSKVICHEV (201-285090), employee
in the Soviet Trade Representation in Mexico
from March 1961 to July 1964, known KGB. Subject
gave MOSKVICHEV his home address in MosCOM.
Vladimir Nikolayevich RADVANSKIY (201-298171),
code clerk at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico from
September 1964 to March 1967, known KGB. Subject
is not known to have associated with RADVANSKIY;
however, Subject's wife and RADVANSKAYA worked
together in the school and children's camp, and

RADVANSKAYA took over the camp after Subject's
wife left Mexico. RADVANSKAYA asked Subject's
wife to tell her (RADVANSKAYA'S) daughter to
enter the institute when she saw her in Moscow.
7. Vladimir Aleksandrovich ROMANCHENKO (201-727109),
Second Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
from August 1963 to July 1967, no known RIS
affiliation. When ROMANCHENKO was in Moscow
on leave in May 1964, Subject told "Boris"
(believed to be Subject's brother-in-law) to
send letters to him through ROMANCHENKO when
he came back to Mexico.
8. Georgiy Stepanovich VISKO (201-243602), Commercial
Counselor in Mexico from July 1962 to circa
