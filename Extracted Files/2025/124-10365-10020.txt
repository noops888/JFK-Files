V. RESULTS OF POLYGRAPH EXAMINATION. 250
NW 50953 DocId:32318825 Page 8
I. PREFACE
A. Purpose of Paper
This paper has been prepared to compare the results
of the 1967-68 interrogations of YURI NOSENKO with a CIA
paper dated February, 1968, entitled "The Examination of
the Bona Fides of a KGB Defector." This CIA paper was based
on previous interrogations of NOSENKO and concluded that
NOSENKO is not a bona fide defector
According to the paper, in arriving at this
conclusion the lengthy interrogations of NOSENKO, analysis
of KGB operations which he related and comparison of his
assertions with collateral information from other sources
were considered.
B. Background
For convenience in assessing these papers, the
following chronology of events is set forth:
NOSENKO first made contact with CIA in Geneva in
June, 1962. After several meetings he returned to Russia
and was not again in contact with CIA until his return to
Geneva in January, 1964. On his return to Geneva he indicated

deglassification
NW 50953 DocId:32318825 Page 9
Significant inaccuracies were detected in the CIA
paper regarding the KEYZERS, MORONE and ABIDIAN cases.
Contrary to statements in the paper, KEYZERS was not inter-
viewed about homosexual activities before he left Moscow;
MORONE did have contact with a girl at American House posing
as a West German journalist; the Soviet maid TATYANA FEDOROVICH
did have access to ABIDIAN's living quarters within six months
after his arrival in Moscow.
COMMENT: A number of previous CIA conclusions
regarding this period were based on deficient
interrogations of NOSENKO and inadequate
collateral inquiries. These conclusions have
been invalidated by current interrogation and
collateral inquiries and there is no substan-
tial basis for doubting NOSENKO's basic claims
regarding this period. (U)
F. 1962-64 period (U)
It is concluded in the CIA paper that NOSENKO's
claims of being Chief of the American-British Commonwealth
12
NW 50953 DocId:32318825 Page 10
is alleged that NOSENKO did not indicate the sources from
which he obtained the information regarding the cases. (4)
During current interrogation NOSENKO provided sources
or logical explanation for his knowledge in sixteen of the
nineteen cases referred to above. He also provided adequate
clarification regarding three of the other five cases which
were subjects of CIA criticism. In addition a current review
of his notes by NOSENKO provided the translation "ECTOR",
instead of "ACTOR" or "PROCTOR" previously obtained, as the
name of an agent. Collateral investigation has developed
a logical suspect by this name. (Logical suspects named
"ACTOR" or "PROCTOR" were not previously identified.)
COMMENT: Previous interrogations of NOSENKO in
which information was not obtained regarding
the sources for these cases were obviously
inadequate. Current interrogations have
provided significant clarifying information. (4)(4)
15
NW 50953 DocId:32318825 Page 11
I. New Cases and New Information
The current interrogations of NOSENKO have developed
six new cases involving nine people which were previously not
uncovered during his interrogations. Collateral investigation
has identified six of these persons and one (DOMENICO CANALA) (5)
has been interviewed and admitted the allegations. This case
is considered significant corroboration of NOSENKO.
Additional significant data was developed on three
cases previously mentioned by NOSENKO. Data in one case (the
Brussels case) may assist in the identification of a KGB agent
who supplied NATO codes. (4)
Considerable interesting, new and confirmatory data
was obtained during the current interrogations. Twelve examples
are cited. (U)
COMMENT: The new cases, new information and
confirmatory data obtained in the current inter-
rogations and collateral inquiries also clearly
establish that the previous interrogations were
deficient and collateral inquiries inadequate.
Failure to acknowledge significance of NOSENKO's
personnel identifications and organizational data
denotes lack of objectivity in CIA paper. (4)
16
NW 50953 DocId:32318825 Page 12
appear reluctant in the past. One was his
extra-marital affair with a friend of INGA
KARLAMOVA and the other was his arrest in
1954 when he used a KGB cover document to
obtain treatment for venereal disease. As
a result he was removed as Komsomol Secretary.
In addition the "Characteristic" which was prepared
on him in early 1955 was critical of him and his
mother had interceded with PETR FEDOTOV, Chief
of SCD, who transferred NOSENKO to the 7th
Department. This intercession possibly prevented
his dismissal from KGB.
2. Assignment Against Correspondents (4)
Pages 75-80 relate to NOSENKO's assignment to
operations against American correspondents. It was stated
that although NOSENKO could give a breakdown of the network
of agents used against correspondents in terms of number and
type of agents, he had forgotten their true names and could
not provide personality information on any of them. (4)
37
NW 50953 DocId:32318825 Page 13
necessary and they were suitable for use in a
case.) NOSENKO had files on both of these agents
which he turned over to PHILLIP VASILYEVICH KISLITSYN
when NOSENKO began work on military attaches. He
had no opportunity to use "RAKETA" in 1953.
"RAKETA" was an agent for some officer of Section II,
1st Department in 1960 or 1961. (4)
5. Colonel EARL L. MICKELSON (5)
On page 88 it is stated that Colonel EARL L.
MICKELSON was involved in at least two incidents inside
the Soviet Union which NOSENKO did not report.
COMMENT: During interrogation of NOSENKO he could not
recall specifically the arrest of MICKELSON. But
stated that there were many "akts" against U. S.
military attache personnel in which they were
detained and written descriptions of their so-called
"violations" were prepared. He indicated that the
attache personnel, of course, in most instances
refused to sign such documents, but nevertheless
41
NW 50953 DocId:32318825 Page 14
they were prepared. (4)(U)
IRA B. RICHARDS (15)
On pages 89 and 90 the paper indicates that NOSENKO
correctly identified IRA B. RICHARDS as an Assistant Army
Attache and named his maid MARIYA NEVEROVA as an agent reporting
on him. It was stated, however, that NOSENKO referred to
LUDMILA GROMAKOVA in connection with another matter as a
KGB agent during 1960-62 but did not relate her to RICHARDS (5)
or to the 1953-55 period. GROMAKOVA gave RICHARDS Russian
language lessons. It was also stated that NOSENKO did not
know of VOLODYA who was RICHARDS driver and therefore should
have been NOSENKO's agent..
COMMENT: On December 11, 1967, (N-64), NOSENKO, in
response to a request, furnished a handwritten list
of his agents. For the period 1953-54 he listed as
an agent a teacher of the Russian language who was
giving lessons to correspondent CLARK. He also listed
for the period 1954-55 drivers of the military attache (U)
and his officers, indicated there were five or six and
42
NW 50953 DocId:32318825 Page 15
furnished the name of one as "SHNIREV." (NIKOLAY
VASILYEVICH SHNYRYEV). NOSENKO was not specifically
questioned concerning VOLODYA and GROMAKOVA's connections
with RICHARDS (5)
HOWARD L. FELCHLIN (5)
Pages 90-93 of the paper relate to Assistant Army
Attache HOWARD L. FELCHLIN. It was indicated that NOSENKO
correctly identified FELCHLIN but knew nothing of his back-
ground, did not recall names of agents specifically targeted
against him, did not recall a newspaper article in March,
1954, falsely accusing FELCHLIN and his companion, did not
recall any unusual circumstances involving the expulsion of
FELCHLIN and MCKINNEY in 1954 and when told that the expulsion
took place in that year stated this was not the correct date.
It was also indicated NOSENKO did not recognize the name of
FELCHLIN's maid, FEDEROVA.
COMMENT: On April 1, 1968, (N-182), NOSENKO stated
that he had a file on FELCHLIN and utilized a
chambermaid NEFEDOVA against him as well as
43
NW 50953 DocId:32318825 Page 16
drivers for the military attache's office. He
described the chambermaid and furnished her code
name as "SHEVEDOVA". When shown the name FEDEROVA
he indicated that this was the name of FELCHLIN'S (5)
maid rather than NEFEDOVA. He also said that her
first name was probably MARIYA but recognized DORA
as the first name when it was mentioned to him. He
stated that a driver for the military attache office
was "SHNYREV" and accurately furnished his first name
as NIKOLAY. He said there were several "akts" on
FELCHLIN during his travel in the USSR which FELCHLIN (5)
refused to sign. He recalled that FELCHLIN was
arrested with another officer while NOSENKO and his
wife were at Kubienka during the summer of 1954. He
said that this occurred on the 8th or 9th of the month,
probably July, and had appeared in the newspapers on
those dates. He stated that he had been on vacation
and his wife had given birth to a baby in August, 1954.
(Actually the arrest took place on July 4, or July 5,
1954, and may well not have appeared in the Soviet
44
NW 50953 DocId:32318825 Page 17
newspapers until the 8th or 9th). (4)
NOSENKO also pointed out that KGB obtained
considerable information from microphones concerning
operations and plans of the Military Attache personnel
including their discussions before trips, their plans
for visiting various cities and points of interest
and their conversations after their trips. In addition
KGB knew how much money they had each year for
operations, the reactions of the officers to each
other, etc. Excerpts of information were given to
the Disinformation Department of KGB. (4)
8. Expulsion of [BENSON, MULE and STROUD (5)
Pages 95 and 96 deal with the expulsion from the
Soviet Union of Assistant U. S. Army Attaches BENSON, MULE (5)
and STROUD. This expulsion resulted from seizure of equipment
carried by these officers on May 5, 1955, and they were declared
personae non gratae. It was stated that NOSENKO claimed that
this incident had occurred after he was transferred to the
7th Department; however, when the May 7 date was given to him
45
NW 50953 DocId:32318825 Page 18
he had turned the 1st Section files over to
VALERIY BUDYLDIN who had worked for a short
period but was later fired from KGB and the
files were then transferred to VICTOR RASSADIN (4) (4)
It appears that NOSENKO's failure to recall
details of this incident could be due to his
hospitalization at the time it occurred. (4) (U)
9. GEORGE VAN LAETHEM (5)
Pages 97 and 98 relate to GEORGE VAN LAETHEM, Assistant
Army Attache, at the American Embassy from March, 1951, to
March, 1953. NOSENKO had reported that ALLA LARIONOVA was
placed on a train going from Berlin to Moscow with an assign-
ment to strike up an acquaintance with VAN LAETHEM. She
succeeded in meeting him and gave him her address and tele-
phone number; however, he did not call her. NOSENKO heard
about this from PANKRATOV and knew of no other KGB interest
in VAN LAETHEM. (5) It was pointed out that VAN LAETHEM denied
any meeting with LARIONOVA as alleged by NOSENKO and further
VAN LAETHEM was again in Moscow from March 19 to May 19, 1955,
47
NW 50953 DocId:32318825 Page 19
while NOSENKO was still the case officer responsible for
Army Attaches. He was reported to the Russians as an
Assistant Army Attache on permanent assignment although it
was actually a temporary assignment.
COMMENT: As indicated above NOSENKO stated on
April 16, 1968, (N-181), that he was in the hospital
for 30 or 40 days just prior to transfer to the 7th
Department and would have been in the hospital during
April, 1955. When told that VAN LAETHEM returned to
the USSR on March 19, 1955, NOSENKO said that he did
not remember it.
10. EDWARD ELLIS SMITH (4)
On page 99 the paper points out that NOSENKO claimed
to have personally participated in the KGB operation against
EDWARD ELLIS SMITH in 1954-55 but the incident described by
NOSENKO in which SMITH was approached occurred in June, 1956,
after NOSENKO had been transferred to the 7th Department for
about a year. (4)
48
NW 50953 DocId:32318825 Page 20
11. ANDREY" (4)
On page 99 it is also indicated that if NOSENKO
served in the Embassy Section (1st Section, 1st Department)
during 1953-55, "It is difficult to perceive how he could
have remained unaware of 'ANDREY'S' identity." NOSENKO
claimed that "ANDREY" was spotted by ROY RHODES and was
recruited prior to NOSENKO's connection with KGB in March,
1953. "ANDREY" was a crypto-repairman and the direct
subordinate of the Army Attache cryptographic security
officer, Captain WALTER MULE, who was NOSENKO's target.
COMMENT: NOSENKO has consistently stated that
"ANDREY" was being handled by KOVSHUK, assisted
by BORODIN, and that he obtained information
regarding "ANDREY" through conversations with
KOVSHUK and BORODIN. Inasmuch as NOSENKO did not
enter the KGB until 1953, it does not seem
inconsistent for officers in his section not to
reveal to him the identity of an important agent
who was furnishing important information on a current (4)
52
NW 50953 DocId:32318825 Page 21
their duties and in addition noted that there were
2 FCD officers who were assigned to the Section
"in practice" (for training purposes). He named
one of these officers. On the same date he listed
his special targets among the correspondents and
military officers during this period and discussed
the actions against them. He indicated that he had
operated agents against officers of the Military
Attache's office but was not responsible for the
officers of the Navy and Air Force. In addition he
said that the Sergeants of all of the services were
the responsibility of another officer in the section.
He stated that the main objectives against the Sergeants
were to ascertain their weaknesses and place girls in
contact with them. Normally KGB officers were not
sent with foreign Attaches when they traveled in the
USSR except to look for electronic gear. He described
a search of the luggage of the Military Attache
FILLMORE K. MEARNS (5) which he participated with

IONOV and KARETNIKOV of OTU whom he had known since
1953. (4)
When shown a list of Soviets employed by
the U. S. Embassy in 1954 he selected the names
of eleven as agents of the 1st Section. On
February 8, 1968, (N-125), photographs of 18
Soviet employees of American House were displayed
to him. He identified an old woman known as
BABUSHKA as an agent who had worked at American
House before 1953 and who had retired about 1960.
In another group he recognized the photograph of
TAMARA ANTUFEVA as an agent utilized in the
FREDERICK R. MC MAHON case who was sent to Berlin
to contact him but was unsuccessful. He did not
recognize the photograph of GALINA G. MOROZOVA
and said he never saw her but Officer RAKOVSKIY,
who worked against American House and the Sergeants,
had an agent named MOROZOVA in 1953 or 1954. He
recognized the photograph of RAISA TROFIMOVA and
furnished her name as an agent of RAKOVSKIY.

that CIA warned BELITSKIY against SHUIGINA. The paper noted
that CIA did not warn BELITSKIY against SHUIGINA but BELITSKIY
had reported to CIA that SHULGINA was a KGB agent. SHULGINA
was for two years a Secretary-Correspondent of NBC Correspondent
IRVING R. LEVINE and according to BELITSKIY was involved in
the sexual entrapment and KGB recruitment of British MP TOM
DRIBERG. (5) It was stated that NOSENKO's apparent ignorance of
SHULGINA's involvement with LEVINE and other Americans belied
his claim that she was his agent during the 1955-58 period.
It was also noted that in 1964 he failed to recognize her photo-
graph; when shown her name he identified her not as his former
agent but as an SCD agent involved with BELITSKIY. (5)
COMMENT: On December 11, 1967, (N-64), NOSENKO listed
SHULGINA as one of his agents and indicated that in
1960 she left Intourist and worked in the Radio
Committee. On January 24, 1968, (N-109), he stated
that she was an agent of GEORGIY IVANOVICH RASTRUSIN
