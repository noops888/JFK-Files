2. Source said that during the revelutica he 'v's a member of the
DR in the University of liebena. After the revolution he went to the
University of Orinc, Santiago de Cuba, and eventually became the DRE
chief for the city. In regard to his former a association he had no
operational leads, claiming that all contact with PR members terminated
in 1959, and he knew no one who attained any stature in the Castro
Government.
3. As DRC chief for Santiago, the source claimed that he hal 50
members who he considered well organized and capable of any type of
action. He said that there were, and are, other nembers, but he docs
not consider then in the same category with the 50 who are organized into
cells. He said cach cell has nine men. There are four cells in the
University of Criente and two in the high school.
4. He said that he left Santiago in Harch 1962 and turned the DRE
over to his deputy. He then went to Habana and informed the DRE leader-
ship that the second in command had taken over and he was told that
llabana would initiate contact with the new leader. (Note: Since close
relations are maintained by the JRAVE Station and the DRE, no attempt
was made to press the source for naves and addresses, etc., as this in-
formation can be obtained in subsequent outside debriefings. The JHHAVS
Officer responsible for the DRE operational matters was informed of the
source's arrival and processing.)
5. Source said that at the time he left Santiago, the remnants of
the Catholic student organization was trying to make contact with the
DIE and he believes that by this time this contact has been made. He
said that the DRE member who was following this matter, and who would
follow through, was a blind person.
6. Listing the arms and supplies in the possession of the DRE in
Santiago, the source said that it has about 5-6 pounds of plastic remain-
ing out of a shipment of 20 pounds which was received fron the DRE in
Habana. He said the DRE in Santiago placei babs in places where the
explosion would not injure anyone. As far as arms are concerned the
source said that the Dực in Santiago has ten caliber pistols; five
38 caliber pistols; one M-3; and one Toray .

why he
a.
He said that his father is in Jail in Puerto Boniato,
and that in order to try and get hin free, the source went to see Kajor
Delarmino "Anibal" Castilla, the chief of training for the Palma Soriano
Military Dacaarnent, whom he knew fron their days in the Santiago High
School. Source made his plea an: "Anibal" told him that before he could
act upon it, he would have to talk to the source for five hours in order
to determine his political orientation. The source replied that he did
not come to talk politics but to picad for his father. "Anibal"
answered that he would think about it and call the source one vay or
another, but he never called. Source thought that this story adequate-
ly demonstrated the (Corrnnist) political orientation of "Anibal."
b. The brother of "Anibal" (pera 6a above) is "Bertico"
Castilla, first name possibly Alberto. He resigned from the army and
is now living in Santiago, but the source is not clear on "Bertico's"
political orientation.

Santiago G-2 chief), is no longer the civil head (confssionado) of
Santiago. She is now the president of the Federacion de Mujeres Cubanas.

Province to the DRE member he left in charge of Santiago DME (see para 4
dum above). Information is passed from Santiago to the DIE in Habena and
well Thin the latter, in turn, is to forward the information to the States.
c. Source said that his contacts who work in Ricaro report
that the Nicaro-Mayari Arriba area is restricted and that unknown types
of military installations are being constructed.

sist of Czechs and Chileans. The Czechs have started a new medical
