Status of Document:
Postponed in Part
Number of releases of previously postponed information: 5
Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.
Number of Postponements: 3
Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.
Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could
