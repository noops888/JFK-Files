1 to 9:
CCS recommends deletion of that part of the last sentence, following
the semi-colon of the first paragraph on page 10 of Chapter XI, which qa
identifies (Camp Perry as the site of Agency training courses. (Camp Perry)
is an Agency training installation under DOD cover, and while its CIA
affiliation has been alleged numerous times in the press, no confirmation
of this affiliation has been made by the Agency. Mr. Phillips' comments
as a former senior Agency officer can be interpreted as constituting
official acknowledgement of the CIA/CAMP PERRY relationship
