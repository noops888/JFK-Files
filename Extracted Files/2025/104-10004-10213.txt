Visa Puccedures,
1. With the approval of C/SR and the DDP, I met with Mr. W.
David Slawson of the staff of the President's Commission on the
Assassination of President Kennedy at 1400 hours on this date in
the Commission's offices at 200 Maryland Avenue, N.E., Washington,
D.C. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss apparent inconsistencies
in material provided the Commission by CIA and by the Department of
State which were called to our attention in a letter from the General
Counsel of the Commission to Mr. Helms, dated 3 July 1964.
2. By way of introduction, Mr. Slawson said that in the portion of the
Commission's report that he was writing, he would have to deal with the
question of whether or not the OSWALDs' departure from the USSR - and
the circumstances (i.e. timing) of that departare were unusual or
suspicious in any way. He expressed his belief that they probably were
not and cited Soviet relaxation in such matters in the post-Stalin era.
However, he wanted to be sure in his own mind that our information was
not in conflict with that which the Commission had received from State
since all of that information would remain in the records of the
Commission.
3. After stating my belief that there was no real disagreement or
inconsistency between the information from CLA and that from State, I
expressed the view that the matter resolved itself into three questions:

a. Do the Soviet authorities normally permit Soviet
citizens married to foreign nationals to emigrate from the
Soviet Union to the homelands of their spouses?
b. Do they normally permit such Soviet citizens to
accompany (i.e. depart simultaneously with) their spouses
from the Soviet Union?
c. How long does it take such Soviet citizens to get
Soviet exit visas for such a purpose (time lapse from application
to granting of visas)?
4. Concerning the first two questions (3a and 3b above) I pointed out.
that we had addressed ourselves mainly to the question of Sovie: citizens
being allowed to accompany their spouses abroad while State dealt only
with the larger question of Soviets married to foreigners being allowed
to emigrate without reference to whether or not they left simultaneously
with or at another time from their spouses. Mr. Slawson commented
that this explanation was most helpful and he reread what both we and
State had said in that light.
5. By way of further explanation, I said that the statements in
paragraph 6 of our memorandum of 6 April 1964 concerning Soviets being
permitted to accompany their foreign spouses abroad were based on a
review of 26 cases, of which 10 involved Americans. In only four of
these cases did a Soviet wife leave the USSR in the company of her foreign
husband; in 14 of the cases the foreign spouse departed alone; and in the
remaining seven cases insufficient details are known to permit us to
categorize them. I added that although State's information began by
citing the issuance of 724 quota and non-quota immigrant visas by the
American Embassy in Moscow during the period FY 1954 to December
1963, it did not indicate how many of these visas were for Soviet citizens
who had married U.S. nationals. Actually State provided detailed
information for only sixteen cases and did not indicate in many of these
whether or not the Soviet was permitted to accompany the foreign spouse.

6. In response to a question from Mr. Slawson I stated that most
of the 26 cases upon which we based our statements involved foreign
students, exchange teachers and other relatively transient persons,
and while a number of cases have certain points in common, they bear
little similarity to the OSWALD case in that none involved a defector who
married prior to repatriating. I noted that paragraph 6 of our 6 April
1964 memorandum to the Commission had pointed this out. Mr. Slawson
indicated that he was now satisfied on this matter.
7. Concerning the length of time taken by Soviet authorities to
process exit visas for Soviet citizens married to foreign nationals
(question 3c above), I stated that, in my opinion, the information
provided by State (in the third enclosure to Mr. Meeker's letter)
substantially corresponded to the views expressed in paragraphs 6 and 7
of our memorandum to the Commission dated 6 April 1964. Mr. Slawson
asked if it would be possible to elaborate paragraph 7 of our memorandum
of 6 April by providing a statistical breakdown of the cases on which our
statements were based. I indicated that this could be done.
8. At this point Mr. Slawson stated that as a result of our discussion
he felt that the question of possible inconsistencies bad been resolved.
However, he asked that we send a brief written reply to the Commission's
letter of 3 July 1964 embodying the substance of what I had said concerning
the basis for statements included in our 6 April 1964 memorandum. (This
would include the gist of the draft reply to the Commission which I showed
to C/SR on 8 July plus an elaboration of our statements concerning Soviet
visa applications.]
9. Mr. Slawson indicated that he would be sending parts of his report
dealing with the Soviet intelligence services to CIA for checking as to
their accuracy. He did not say when this would occur.
10. After concluding the meeting with Mr. Slawson, I read Volume 52
of the transcript of testimony before the Commission. This included the
reinterview of Marina OSWALD.

In three cases there was a lapce of several months between appli-
cation and issuance of the Soviet exit viss (five months in one case,
six in the second, and nine in the third). In another case the western
husband was reluctant to leave the USSR without his Sorint iise the
did se sore six months after the wedding only because the Soviet author-
itics told him that her exit application could not be processed until
he bad left. The visa was issued-only about six weeks after his de-
parture, but it may have been applied for when they were married or
at any time during the next six months.
In four other cases it is possible to infer approximate tire
limits for the granting of an exit visa. ûne was granted within four
to five months, the second within six to seven xonths, the third within
nine months, and the fourth within eleven months. In three additional
cases visa issuance took a kinisur of seren, eleven, and twelve months
respectively.

1. Paragraph 6,of our memorandum of 6 April 1964 was a
response to question 13 of your memorandum of 12 March 1964 entitled:
1
t
Questions Posed by State Department Files. That question read as follows:
"At the time that L.H. OSWALD and M. OSWALD left
Russia for the United States was it legal and normal under Soviet law
and practice for a Russian national married to an American to be able
to accompany him back to his homeland? Was the rapidity with which
LH. OSWALD was able to accomplish this and Marina's return in
any way unusual?"
:
2. Our reply addressed itself to the legality and normality of Soviet
citizens accompanying (i.e.: departing simultaneously with) foreign spouses
out of the USSR. It was based on a review of 26 cases, of which 16 involved
Americans, in which foreign nationals married Soviet citizens in the USSR.
In only four of these 26 cases, did the Soviet wife leave the Soviet Umion in the
company of her husband. In one of these four cases, an Italian Communist
/ Party member married
13-00000
Party member married in the USSR and by prevalling upon the Italian Embassy
to hold up Italian visas for Soviet seamen, was able to arrange for his wife to
accompany him to Italy. In two more of the cases, an American met his
future wife on a visit to the USSR, married her on a subsequent trip, and
brought her back to the U.S. No details are available on the fourth case,
which involved a Swedish student who married a Soviet student and apparently
brought her out with him.
3. In 14 of the remaining cases, a foreign husband (in one case a wife)
departed alone. In another case the wife preceded her husband because he
had been jailed a month or two previously for violation of travel regulations
and in 7 additional cases the sequence is not known.
The information in the third enclosure to Mr. Meeker's letter
regarding length of time taken by Soviet authorities to process visa applications
of Soviet wives of American citizens substantially corresponds with the
conclusions which we expressed in paragraph 7 of our inemorandum of
6 April 1964. The material from Mr. Meeker provides useful additional data

apparent in-

1. On 9 July 1964 Mr. W. David Slawsan and a representative of
CIA discussed the question of apparent inconsistencies in material pro-
vided the Commission by CIA and by the Department of State. At that
time the question was resolved to Mr. Manzen's satisfaction, and it
was agreed that CIA would furnish a statistical breakden of the cases
en which CIA based the statements in paragraph 1 of its menerandum of
6 April 1964.
2.
Paragraph 7 of the 6 April Reeraco addressed itself to the
legality and nernality of Soviet citizens departing the USSR simultan-
eously with their foreign speuses. Statements were based on a review
of 26 sases (ten involving Americans) in which foreign nationals married
Seriet citizens in the USSR. In enly three of these 26 cases did the
Soviet wife leave the USSR in the company of her imsband. In two of the
cases an American met his future wife on a visit to the Soviet Union,
married her on a subsequent trip, and brought her back to the U.S. Ne
details are available on the third case, which invelved a Swedish student

3. The information in the third entlasure to Mr. Meeker's letter
regarding length of time taken by Seriet echorities to process visa
applications of Soviet wives of kerican citizens substantially corres-
ponds with the conclusions which we expressed in paragraph 7 of the sur
6 April memorandum. In ežeren of the 25 eases, this time period is
known fairly definitely er san be inferred. In three cases it took fron
five to nine months. Inferring is the other eight cases, three took
about six months, two more were issued in net more than nine to eleven
rossied
months, and three teet a minimum of seven to twelve months. Apparent
inconsistencies between these statisties and these provided by the State
Department undoubtedly arise from a differeme in appreash by the State
Department and CIA.

In three cases there was a lapse of several months between
application and isscance of the Soviet exit visa (five months in ene
ease, six in the second, and far in the third). In another case the
Western husband was reluctant to leave the USSR without his Soviet wife.
Be did se sens six months after the wedding only because the Soviet
authorities told him that her exit application could not be precessed
until he had left. The visa was fesmed only about six weeks after his
departure, but it may have been applied for when they were married er
at any time during the next six smths.
In four other cases it possible to infer approximate time lixits
for the granting of an exit visa. Ime was granted within four to five
menths, the second within sir to servem senths, the third within nine
menths, and the fourtin within elem meaths. In three additional cases
visa issuance teek a winivan of seven, eleven, and twelve months res-
