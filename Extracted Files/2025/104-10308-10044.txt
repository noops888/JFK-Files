Armando Munero enclosed a note he asked to have sent over, "La Voz d
las Americas" (onda corta--m ort wave). This is supposed to be some
sort of signal to his O. P. C. group in Cuba to get behind and
cooperate with information and sabotage.-------

Del Junco's sister saw him this past Friday night at his home and
gave him $5,000.00 in U. S. Dollars(money) to send through the Po
to Cuba to be given to her brother down there. She didn't want t
disclose to Bart where and from whom she received the money, and
only said that it was from his group (HDC) here. Bart thinks that
this is not true. He sent the money down already.

this Dr. F'dez.(around 60 yrs. old) is a person that could very e
organize his office to be of very valuable service against Castro
his Communists here in the States, as well as in Latin America wh
they already have their own agents operating. It is felt that De

importance of the planned Intelligence Service the Frente thro!!

Dr. F'dez. says that they are now working on the ABC form as used
against a former president of Cuba known as Machado. Enclosed is
an idea of how this group functions and are placed into many walks
life of importance to this cause.. Their work is mainly of Intell

possible without trying to get monies, if possible, to function. I

in back of building at 15th Street, off Brickell Ave., worked for

National Bank of Cuba). Josefina Socarras worked with them also:

I have written of Josefina before through!
findings of Frank, who knew them all in Cuba(not Despain directly:
only his family). This Captain Despain is an intimate friend of
Ceferino and Josefina(planning to go to New York soon). She has
trying to get something started here, as reported before. It is
strongly urged that this Josefina be surveilled constantly as І,
as well as Frank, think that she is affiliated with Castro's cland
activities here in the States. She received monthly checks from ti
Centro Refugiado Cap tain Despain is planning on going to join t
U. S. Army. He is definitely strongly suspected of giving everyth
of Intelligence to Castro and is tied in with the Communist and Cas
groups here. He may even soon plan to disappear from the scene and
should not be allowed to get off easily. He has been keeping Dr.
Jose Julio Fernandez from organizing his anti-Castro and Anti-Comuni
files due to lack of funds (says Despain). It seems that this was ju
an excuse before and was done to keep the ball functioning as shoul
bę. I think that this Dr. Jose Julio Fernandez is very sincere an
is innocently giving everything into the hands of Despain without
knowing. How Despain got into this position is not known by us yet.

As far as we are concerned he is a Castro penetration into the Frent
and U. S. activities.
The above is the result of being sent to see Dr. Jose Julio Fernande
head of Intelligence Servence of the Frente (as told us by Former
Cuban Grl. Socallanes, friend of Franktx I went with Frank to try t
find out about a woman whose son(one of two of them) had taken data

Dr. D'dez. informed me of the following:
(a). A Communist militant; Alberto Iglesias, 425 Cedar Lane,
Meadow, New York(Phones: IV-1-4368 and IV-6-4547). He is a
Resident of the U. S. for more than 20 years. He has his

considered as one of Fidel Castro's heads here with a gre
many ties.
Enclosed find a break down of expenses of the Frente Intell. Offi

helping the Dr. get funds for the maintenance of this office for
least another month. I think that this set up should be taken in
study.

Enclosed find marked #9, 2 documents, given me by Emanuel Carvaja
last night which are self-explanatory in Spanish. One is a list
exiles in their Costa Rican Embassy in Havana, and the other is a
cocument(copy) signed and given today to the Minister of Foreim
Relations of Cuba in Havana. It seems that there was very much
discussions concerning some amongst the foreign diplomats in Cuba
The Egyptian Embassador (RAU:Syria, etc.) went to the first meetin
the diplomats had in Habane concerning the new monetary exchanges
He first agreed strongly with the rest and promised to sign the
enclosed type document concerning the new exchange in Cuba.
first meeting was held last Monday, Aug.13th, and they met again

T
a second time on Thursday in order to sign. He (name not known by
Carvajal) then refused to sign and did not even show up which ind
ted to the remainder of the diplomats that his money must have ber
exchanged in the full amount to keep him off the list of simature
The Swiss Charge D' Affairs informed at the same meeting, to the
Diplomats, that he received information from his Government that t
Swiss Gov't. was checking all present Cuban bank accountants exist
in Switzerland and were readying themselves to act accordingly in
case the Cuban Gov't. should not reach any agreement in regards to
the exchange with the Diplomats.

difficulties as a protest against the behavior of the Cuban Gov'
This he told at the Diplomatic meeting.
About a week ago, there was a hunger strike at the Brazilian nh
by the exiles there. However, they gave up as a gesture to only
obedience to the Embassador. They protested against not reccivi
salvo conductos and other things.
This coming week, Monday or Tuesday, the Diplomats again are cet
together at a meeting to protest before the Cuban Gov't. about t
lax and Arposeful designing ways of handling this affair, and
remind the Gov't. of their obligations in extending the courtesy
according International agreements.
Carvajal asked me not to mention this, but later said that he
informed us about Embassador Quiros leaving Havana this Thursday
as he was being recalled by the Costa Rican Gov't. for consultati
Carvajal will be in charge of the Embassy for the time, but said
he didn't expect the Embassador to return as he is taking his fa
and house hold items.
He also told me again that Eduardo Odio, Costa Rican Consul in
Havana, was a person not to be trusted by many experiences they h
already had with him.
