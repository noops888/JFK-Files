In 1953 we created a separate control file
(62-99724) under the caption," CIA - James_Angleton," for
the purpose of retaining copies of certain types of
memoranda disseminated to us by James Angleton, Chief
Counterintelligence Staff, CIA. We believe that it is no
longer necessary to maintain this control file.

(JFK)
In the way of background, the control file was
created to give us the opportunity of closely monitoring
Sour liaison with Angleton on a variety of matters which were
not reported through normal CIA channels. CIA Directors
permitted Angleton to run several intelligence projects,
Ymany of them with the Israeli Intelligence Service. SHe
He was
given authority by CIA to handle these projects and report
only to the Director, CIA. He was given authority to
disseminate to the FBI on all matters of interest to us.
In 1953 we worked out an agreement where Angleton disseminated
to us, and we attributed the information to Bureau Informant 100
The field was given appropriate instructions regarding the
handling and reporting of the information. This procedure is
still in existence and is operating satisfactorily.
The information disseminated by Angleton is_filed
in the case file_of_an_individual or an organization. The
control file consists of copies of communications already
recorded in separate case files. There has been little or
no occasion to use the control file, and its usefullness at
this point can be characterized as being obsolete. 62-99724-78
