Panamanian Repressive Measures against Cuban Exiles
ACTION REQUIRED FEFEFENCES
ACTION: See para 5.
1. A compilation of information reported by Station::
penetrations of the local service (i.e. HYEPOCH-5, ПУЕРОСИ-11;1,
HYRAVEN-11) indicates that the local security service is assuming
an increasingly hostile posture against Cuban exiles traveling to
Panama. The reporting sources coincide in their information that
this attitude is directed primarily against Cuban exiles residing
in Miami. It appears that this development may be the result of
the reporting of HYGRUFF-1's agent in Miami, Salvador ALDAREGUIA.
ALDAREGULA continues to report from Miari alleging cooperation
between Cuban exiles and Panamanian exiles in Miani who are
opposed to the regime of General Omar TORRIJOS Herrera.
2. HYGRUFF-1.recently submitted a watchlist of Cuban exiles
to Tocumen International Airport (TIA) and other Panamanian ports
of entry ordering the recipients to deny entry into Panama to all
those persons on the watchlist. HYDROCHE-S, the most alert of all
Station penetrations commented that in his opinion the list
contained Cuban Embassy input because his service did not have
the capability to collect sufficient data on all the persons
listed to be able to make a meaningful evaluation of which ones
are dangerous! The Station has not been able to confirm
HYEPOCH-5's suspicions.
3.
For the record, the Cuban exiles on HYGRUFF-1's
watchlist are the following:

4. Of the persons listed above, MCNERTNEY knows Orlando
GARCIA Vasquez well. GARCIA was born in Cuba, becane a
naturalized U.S. citizen when he fled from Cuba to the United
States. lie eventually settled in Venezuela where he became a
close friend and confidant of Carlos Andres PEREZ, now president
of Venezuela. Aside from Venezuelan diplomatic posts he has
held abroad he was at one tine Chief of Operations of DIGLFOL.
MONERTNEY cornented that if the Panamanians ever had the tererit
to mistreat GARCIA that PEREZ' reaction against TORRIJOS would
undoubtedly be fierce.
5. We defer to lleadquarters to name check these individua
ascertain if BKHERALD has any operational interest in any of the
and advise the responsible component to take precautionary
measures in the event any novement of these individuals involves
travel to or transiting Panama. In exploiting this information
please protect the sources.
