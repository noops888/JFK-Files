407.1974
1. In preparing the letter of 18 18 (copy attached)
from the General Counsel to Daniel E. Schultz in response to Mr.
Schultz's letter of 9 April, I obtained from Ms. Chris Hopkins,
WH/COG (x-1325), copies of (1) a secrecy agreement (in Spanish)
by Eugenio Rolando Martinez dated 3 April 1965, (2) an unexecuted
contract (an executed copý cannot be located) between the U.S.
Government and Mr. Spencer O. Terteling (Bernard L. Barker)
and (3) a termination secrecy oath signed by Bernard L. Barker
dated 12 August 1966. Copies of those documents are attached.
2. After discussing the matter with Mr. David Phillips,
C/WH Division, I prepared the 18 April letter adding the second
sentence of the first paragraph at the request of Mr. Joe Skura,
AC/WH/CCG (x-1948). After completing the letter, I coordinated
it on 15 April 1974 with Mr. Skura and agreed to send him a copy
of the final.
3. On 18 April I met with Mr. Schults. I questioned him
as to his intentions regarding the information he was seeking as,
In the Agency's view, clearly there is no connection batween the
Agency's association with Messrs. Darker and Martinen and the
subject case. Mr. Schults-explained that he, as the lawyer repre-
senting thom, foelo obligated to know what they did for the Agency
In order that he can make the determination ne to whether it le
golevant to the current trial--currently scheduled for 17 June.
He mentioned that to daty both Masers. Barker and Martinos had
bean completely unwilling to discuss any aspect of their dutlua
with the Agency. They had been reluctant to oven acknowladge

their association with the Agency. I explained the Agency's serious
reservations concerning the possibility of compromise of agents and
operations that are still in being. I explained that the Agency con-
tinues to have associations with some of the individuals with whom
Messrs. Barker and Martinez had contact during their Agency
association. Mr. Schultz seemed to appreciate this problem. Thus,
in order to attempt to protect those individuals, I explained that the
Agency is currently not in a position to give Messrs. Barker and
Martinez blanket authorization to identify individuals with whom they
had contact during their Agency association. Mr. Schultz readily
acknowledged those conditions.
4. I mentioned to Mr. Schultz that if, as a result of the
discussions that are now being authorized, Mr. Schultz believes
that certain individuals need to be identified he can make such a
narrow request to the Agency at that time. I made no guarantee
that we would approve such a request, only that we would consider
it in view of (1) the rationale that Mr. Schultz would offer as to his
nende, (2) the possibility of publication, (3) the damage to current
oporations, and (4) the precedent in terms of weakening the confi-
dence of current and potential Agency relationships.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Request from OGC for Signed Copy of Bernard
BARKER'S Contract
1. On 18 April 1974 Mr. Dietel of OGC asked if I had
been able to Iscate a signed copy of Bernard Barker's contract
which we were unable to locate a few days ago. The answer
was no. I took advantage of Pete Palmer's presence at Hqs.
on TDY to ascertain whether a signed copy of BARKER's contract
be
could possibly/at Station WH/Miami. Pete said with
certainty there was no signed copy at Station WH/Miami since
much of the material at the Station had been destroyed. Also,
since BARKER was terminated in mid-1966, the Station file
should have been transferred to Hqs. back then.
2. I passed the foregoing informaton to Mr. Dietal
who simply asked that I double check with WH/Contracts and
the Contract Personnel Division for same which I promised to
do and advise.

testimony, which appeared in the "Washington Post" on
11 March 1974, with Mr. Fred Evans, Office of Security,
Mr. Scott Breckenridge, Inspector General's Office,

1. AMSNAP-3 reported on 11 March 1971 that the charges,
of sale of narcotics levied on Jorge ALONSO, the son of
Guillermo ALONSO Pujol (AMECRU-1), were_dropped (no exact
date given). Jorge was arrested. 21 June along with forty
others and charged with being a top figure in the heroin
and cocaine distribution racket.
2. AMSNAP-3 stated that he had talked with a friend
of his, Ray BARKER, on the morning of 11 March, BARKER
told him that he had spoken to Attorney Miguel SUAREZ.
SUAREZ is a law partner of Fernando FREIRE. FREIRE told
SUAREZ that Jorge ALONSO had been released because all
charges stemming from the 21 June arrest were dropped by,
the authorities. Therefore, there will be no trial.
3. CO Comment: It is a sad day when justices can be
bought by the likes of ALONSO. The little man loses again
because if he were charged with an offense 1/10th the
magnitude of Jorge ALONSO's, he would be behind bars for
a long time, and to make it worse, Jonge ALONSO can, novo

ABSTRACT
MICROFILM
A. During the period under review AMCLATTER/1 was transferred
from the PW Branch to the CI Branch for future handling. Subject's
files were turned over to CI on 27 January 1965 and he was informed
by his pw case officer of his proposed transfer at a meeting on
2 February A subsequent meeting was scheduled for 8 February with
AMCLATTER/1 and the PW case officer at which time the latter intro-
duced him to the CI case officer. Subject appeared to be pleased
with this turn of events expressing the wish that he could be put
to more frequent use and be given a heavier work load. He said that
he enjoyed his 2 year association with his previous case officer
but looked forward to getting into a new line of activity, pre-
ferably some type of PM activity or investigative work which he
claims to enjoy as a result of his previous police experience in
Cuba, Bubject was told by the CI case officer that his dutios would
remain essentially the same as they had been and that he should
continue his coverage of exile activities with emphasis on any
rumore of impending exile raids on Cuba.
B. On 18 February Subject was introduced to AMBLINK/1 and was
told that AMBLINK/1 would keep in daily touch with him either by
telephone or by personal meeting. Subject and AMBLINK/1 know one
another from the time when they both were working in Cuba and both

seem pleased with the current arrangement whereby they will be in
contact with one another. In addition to this daily contact,
meetings are held with Subject and AMBLINK/1 about once a week by
the CI case officer to discuss Subject's reporting as well as any
difficulties he may have encountered or guidance he may need.
For all practical purposes, however, AMCLATTER/1/is being handled
by AMBLINK/1. Subject knows nothing about AMBLINK/1's other
operational duties and contacts, and the latter has been instructed
to limit his discussions with ANCLATTER/L to any mutual business at
hand. AMCLATTER/1 knows AMBLINK/1 by true name (which he knew in
Cuba) and has his home telephone number. During the absence of
AMBLINK/1 from the area the CI case officer will meet directly
with Subject.
II. PRODUCTION
Subject provided a number of useful reports during the period under
review mainly concerned with proposed MIRR bombing missions over
Cuba and details concerning the ransacking of AMBIDDY/l's house. The
following disseminations were made as a result of Subject's pro-
duction:
A. UFG-6635 (WAVE 7900; 3 February 1965) from Frank Fiorini:
Alleged abortive Air Raid over Cuba by the MIRR.
B. WAVE 8261 (Rybat; 13 February 1965): Ransacking of
AMBIDDY/1's house.
C. UFG-6710 (WAVE 8326; 16 February 1965) from Frank Fiorini:
Planned Air Strike Against Havana by the MIRR.
D. WAVE 8419 (Rybat; 17 February 1965): Additional information
on Ransacking of AMBIDDY/1's House.
E. UFG-6727 (WAVE 8394; 17 February 1965) from Frank Fiorini:
Decision of Orlanda Bosch Avila to Use Cuban Pilot on MIRR's Air
Strike of Havana.
7. WAVE 8521 (Rybat; 20 February 1965): Additional information
on Ransacking of AMBIDDY/17s House.
6. UTG-8747 (WAVE 8618; 23 February 1968) from Frank Fiorini
and Bill Johnson: Insistence of Orlanda Bosch Avila that the MIRR
Bomb Havana.
ΙΙΙ.
ΡΙΝANCES
Subject was paid his February salary in the amount of $433.77.
(This amount is arrived at after withholding his income tax from
$600.
IV. FUTURE PLANS
AMBLINK/1 will continus to contact Subject on a daily basis
either by telephone or by peranual meetings and will see that
Bubject's
Bubject has hoon instructed to continue his coverage of exile
porterowy do thereofficer
nutivition in the aron with emphasis on prompt reporting of any
imponding exile raida on Cutim, Bubjout will also continue to report
in writing any conversations that he has with Cuban exiles who
appear of operational interest and will explore him wide array of
contacte for any information that may lead to the identification of
Cuban intelligence angete operating in the area, in this connection-
Bubjout is currently exploring a load involving two Cuban mulatto
women who allegedly have hit the boltta numbers frequently (six or
seven times) and for largo sume of money. Bubject, who has a theory
that Fidel Castro may be using the boltta rachat to fund agents in
the U.., in trying to learn the identition of the two mulattos, lie

has been cautioned not to delve too deeply in this matter however
since he may become involved with local underworld elements who
may take drastic action against him in the belief that he is
working for either the local ODENVY or the police. Subject said
that he is well aware of this possibility and is making very
discreet inquiries with the assistance of certain friends (Cuban
ex-policemen) who are bolita runners and who know that he has no
interest in their bolita activities per se except to learn the
identities of the two Cuban mulatto women. Subject said that his
friends, in addition to possibly helping him, would like to know
the identities of the two women sincee they would then play the
same number as the two women and make some money on their own.

Things turned out very well. for I was invited
to a small dinner party last night.. Ernesto was there,
and he freely brought out the subject personsily with
me, as though he wanted me to know. He expects the NIT
man--HARPER--to return from. Miami this week (I do not
know if he meant back to Washington or to New York), ard
something, to appear in the paper some time after that.
As I told you, the NYT is convinced there are three
related events:
a) The We targate affaire.
b) The treat-an at the Chear Panhassy.
c) An attempt to "that ur"
Capitol grounds.

not only with the agency, but also with the cor...parhans
separately, but with similar objectives. A very serious
charge. That is precisely the connection that the NYT
wants to establish. The NYT man claims--according to
Ernesto--to have a photo of Manuel GIBERGA, A Cuban who
is a White House assistant for Spanish-speaking affairs--
and Bernard BARKER, who they think is the key man ("A
CLA agent recruiter"), together.
HARTER also visited Felipe 18208, a
11-
Cuban economist who, at present, in with the Inter-Ames Lan
Development Bank. Harper might have also seen some Chilean
dips, but this is only an inference on my pars.
The other birds on the list that I gave you were
specifically tied to the Kilaberg case. They were brought
up from Miami--armed--to physically disrupt Bilsbergs appearance
before e Congressional Committee. The Cubana were unable to
get to him, but did fight with some of his supporters, who
were arrested. The Cubane were not. Official protection to
what they are looking for in this particular case,
