On 4 January 1963 AMHINT-27 met with QUANTUM-51 in New
York City, and QUANTUM-50advised him that Jorge MEDINA Bringuier,
the Secretary General of AMSPELL in PBRUMEN, Is a G-2 agent.
MEDINA and AEDO (fn), who was said by QUANTUM-50to be on the
ANSPELL National Executiyo; were actually G-2 penetrations. They
planned to "roll up" the eptiro AMSPELL organization and "other
groups" in one sweep and then escape by boat and contact AMRINT-53
in the JMWAVE area. MEDINA was in contact with AMBINT-53 while in
PORUMEN and planned to use AMHINT-53 to establish his bona fides
with KUBARK.

2. QUANTUM-51 further advised that another mission of the
two G-2 agents, MEDINA and AEDO, was to make contact with Iden A
to dete etermine what role it played in anti-CASTRO activities. . The
secretary of QUANTUM-50 had been a very close personal friend of
AEDO'ssi
's since childhood and AEDO feared she would be implica icated, -0.
so he told her or of his espionago mission.or mission. She informed QUANTUM-51
and then arranged a meeting between QUANTUM-51 and AEDO. ALDO told
QUANTUM-51 of his mission and arrangements were then mado to get all
the AMSPELL leaders into asylum in the Uruguayan Embassy. On or
about 10 December 1962 about 25 persons, including AEDO, went into
asylum.
3. QUANTUM-51 further said that AEDO reportedly was arrested
by. G-2 a long time ago and then recruited to work for the PBRUMEN

4. Reference C is a chronological summary of AMBINT-33's
activities subsequent to his infiltration in PBKUMEN, and his
contacts with Chelin, the brother of ANFRET-7. AMFRET-7's arrest
was reported in Reference B. The AMFRET-7 Case Officer states
that both AMFRET-7 and his brother were arrested, after shooting S88-
it out with G-2 and being wounded. As noted in Reference D,
AMFRET-7's arrest was made after QUANTUM-55 and Blanca MARTINEZ
de Hoya, aka "Cuca," aka "Cuchi, brought MEDINA, AMSPELL's National
Military Coordinator for Reception and Supply, to Iden A where
MEDINA recognized AMHINT-33. AMHINT-33 said MEDINA was an old
friend of his and had lived near him.

5.
AMIINT-33 said further that his brother knows MEDINA, that
MEDINA is the man whom AMHINT-33 used in 1961 to check up on REBELLON
(Inu), the FEU Secretary General in PBRUMEN. AMHINT-33 added in
his S/W Nessage 11 of 10 December 1962 that "his friends" are still
in jail.
6. Reference E transmitted a letter written by AMHINT-33
on 29 December 1962 in which he states that G-2 infiltration is so
great that he considers it impossible to organize anything, and he
indicates that some of the agents, as in this case, have been infil-
trated for more than two years. He presumably means infiltrated
into anti-CASTRO organizations and/or activities.
07.
Relative to the "other groups" mentioned in para. 1
above, AMHINT-33's Case Officer believes that AMHINT-33 is probably
referring to the MRR, the MRP, the MDC and the 30th of November.
Kroups. The "friends" mentioned in Para. 5 may be one Eduardo
BRINGAS, who is about 23 years of age, one GOUMI (nu), and others
previously referred to but not identified by AMHINT-33; they may
have worked for AMHINT-33.

8. JMWAVE traces on the individuals involved in this plot
offer little concrete information.
a. It is noted that Jorge MEDINA Bringuier is listed
on Page 13 of Attachment C to UFGA-4977 as an MRR member, with a
listed aka of Carlos PRADO. JMWAVE tracing identifies one Carlos
PRADO as "a brother of Raul, the head of G-2 in Las Villas Province,"
as reported in HAVA-6437, 5 October 1960; there is no further informa
tion on this Carlos PRADO. However, the original source of the inform
ation given in Attachment C of UFGA-1977 was a letter brought out
of PBRUMEN by AMSTRUT-1 about early July 1962. Said letter contained
a $25 money order, issued at Station No. 9, New Orleans, on
16 March 1962, for Jorge MEDINA. Bringuier and purchased by Maria
Teresa MEDINA. The envelope, addressed to Sra. Consuelo. C. de
RIVAS in Mexico City, bore the notation, "For Carlos PRADO," and
contained a note, "This money order for $25 is for Carlos PRADO
from his mother," in addition to the money order. There is one
Carlos PRADO in Mexico. He is studying engineering and is the
brother of Fausting PRADO Garcia, an engineer who works close to
"Che" GUEVARA and is of current KUTUBE interest ☑ Faustino PRADO
is married to Clara ARTIME, A sister of Josefina ARTIME, who is
a close friend of AMGLEN-9, and she is also of current KUTUBE interest
When AMSTRUT-2, who could have given this letter to AMSTRUT-1 to
take out of PBRUMEN, was in Mexico City she called Carlos PRADO by
telephone at 249769 and told him that she was a friend of his mother.
This PRADO family is a large one, and includes another brother,
Angel, who is in Spain, a sister who is a nun in Italy, and another
brother who is a doctor in New York City. Additional data could
be secured on this family from AMSTRUT-2 if desired. However, it
seems probable that this money order may have been sold in Cuba
by Jorge MEDINA and purchased, sooner or later, by the mother of the
Carlos PRADO who is currently a student in Mexico. A copy of the
material carried out by AMSTRUT-1 is being forwarded herewith.
will be noted that a part of the attachment was disseminated as
UFG-1239, 13 July 1962.

b. It is further noted that JMWAVE files show one
"Mongo" listed on Page 14 of Attachment C to UEGA-4977 as captured
and sentenced to 30 years in prison. This information came. from
UFG-779, 12 January 1962, which was based on an ANCUTLER-1 intercept
of a report from the MRR Acting Internal Coordinator in PBRUMEN
to Hipolito LAZARO, the MRR Internal Coordinator temporarily in
PBPRIME, sent via the Argentine Diplomatic Pouch. There was no
further identification of this "Mongo." 24
c. It is noted that Reference F identifies Jorge
HAEDO as a former anti-Castrista who was tortured and doubled by
the PBRUMEN Government; HAEDO appears to be the correct spelling.
d. "Cuca" or "Cuchi" MARTINEZ, who has held the position
of AMSPELL National Coordinator for Civil Resistance, is a personal
friend of AMCOG-3 and family. She is believed to have taken asylum
in the Mexican Embassy. SW Nessage 12 from AMCOG-3, dated
8 December 1962 and received 12 December, reported that QUANTUM-51] 01
advised "Cuca" to hide or be cautious because MEDINA had turned out
to bo a G-2 member. The message said that this was learned from
AMSPELL prisoners and that, during interrogation, they were asked
many questions about "Cuca" and AMOOG-2.
9. When the AMHINT-53 security review mentioned in Reference A
is received, additional investigation as necessary will be made at
JMWAVE.
