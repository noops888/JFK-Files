and I interviewed Mitchell L. VerBall III, at his residence in Powder
Springs, Georgia. In answer to questions asked by Florida, we obtained
the following informations (1) The shipment of firearms shipped by
Lt. Col. Marriott on or about April 11, 1969, to Sionics, Atlanta, Georgia,
contained 11 Title II firearms. These weapons were obtained by Mr.
Gerbell in Vietnam and registered during the amnesty period. Sionice
did not apply for or receive authorization to import these firearms.
(2) The additional boxes of Title II firearms received at Eglin Air
Force Basa during June 1969, were sent at the request of Mr. WerBell
by ARPA, and Col. Patterson authorized the shipments after Mr. WerBell
told him they were for Air Force museum purposes. Mr. Werbell was
shown a list of firearms contained in the two boxea currently being
held by the OSI at Eglin Air Force Base and asked to identify any
belonging to sionics. Ha stated all the sound suppressors except the
one marked HELE 4A, and the winchester Model 52, caliber .22 rifle,
serial number 69494B, were property of Sionics and were taken or sent
to Vietnam by him. He stated these were taken over on approval of the
State Department, and that the Air Force had agreed to send them to
Vietnam and return them to Sionics; however, he has no written author-
ization. He stated the remainder of the firearms were given to him by
authorized persons, and were to be given to the Air Force to put in
museums.
Before Lt. Col, Morriott left Vietnam, Mr. WerBell told him he would

Lt. Col. Marriott told Mr. Werbell he thought the museum would be grateful
for them. Mr. Werbell stated he did not file any Formn 6 on any of the
firearms and had no knowledge of anyone else filing them.
Stonice is in the business of developing and maufacturing silencers for
sale to United States Military Unite and United States Allies. Although
there are apparent violations of Title II of The Gun Control Act of 1968,
it appeara from talking to Mr. WarDoll that on the part of Sionics, they
were unintentional. Mr. Warbell stated that prior to the passing of the
Gun Control Act of 1968, the procedure used in exporting and importing
the firearms was the acceptable mathod with the State Department.

"Thio statement is made in response to inquiry by Special Agent Mr. Richard H.
CAHAN, Office of the Special Investigations, The Inspector General, USA.
concerning the person of one Mr. Mitchell L. WerBell, and, specifically, the

"During the month of January 1969 ((xact dato unknown) I was introduced to
Mr. Kitchell L. WerBell by Col. John V. Patterson, the former Deputy Director,
Bik-T in the latter's office. Col. Patterson stated that Mr. WerBell was
roprosenting the SIONICS Corporation and the purpose of his visit was to show
to the Thai and U.S. staff of the Military Research and Development Center
(MIG) an assortment of special weapons. I attended one of several so-called
indoor demonstrations given by Mr. WerBoll when I noticed approximately 3
austonemado, suit-case type containers in which these weapons were transported.
khon I casually questioned Mr. WerBoll how he got these weapons into Thailand
he answered that they wore flown in from Vietnam by a Thai Royal Air Force
aronsport plane at the request of Air Chief marshal Dawee, Supreme Command
Araed Forces. Concurrently Mr. WerBell produced a set of official U.S.
Covernment Travel Orders approved by the American Embassy in Saigon and
authorized by the Counselor for Administration, U.S. Embassy, Bangkok.
I recall, these orders specified travel by U.S. Military Aircraft authorized
between Bangkok and Saigon and small arms and automatic weapons to accompany
passenger.
"2. Shipment of Box No. 1
As
"Also during the month of January 1969 I received information from the
Battolle Memorial Institute Laboratory Support Manager (EMI/LSM), Mr. Rose B.
Young, that a box containing special weapons had been received in the MRIXG
varehous. The box in question had been shipped via Military Aircraft by the
U.S. Babassy in Saigon to RDC-T Bangkok, Attn: Mr. WorBoll, SIOMICS. The
transportation and Movement Document DD Form 1384 listed the contents of the
box as "official equipment".
"On 28 January 1969, I notified Mr. Ross B. Young (IMI/LSM) in
writing that RDC-T had no contractual connections with the SIONICS Corporacion,
did not desire to store the equipmont, shipped by the U.S. Dbassy in Saigon,
and therefore, to return the shipment to the vendor via the Transportation

XXXXXX DETAILS:
DATE
18 NOV 1969
On 12 November 1969, KARL D. ACKERMAN (former Counselor for Administration,
United States Embassy, Bangkok, Thailand), 99 Victoria Drive, Atherton, California,
was interviewed by SA ROBERT J. NOVACK and the writer, and related substantially as
follows:
ACKERMAN had several conversations with Colonel WALTER ADAMS concerning the
practical problems of getting weapons, belonging to a MITCHELL L. WERBELL, into
Thailand from the Republic of Vietnam in order that WERBELL could put on a fire power
demonstration for the King of Thailand's birthday. At all times during these conversa-
tions, ACKERMAN assumed the weapons were WERBELL's wares, and that he had
brought them from the United States with him. With this in mind, ACKERMAN stated
that he instructed Mr. GERALD T. CARTA to annotate WERBELL's travel orders with a
Bangkok United States Embassy Funding Citation number. ACKERMAN said the citation
numbers were in a block of numbers belonging to the Embassy, and because he did not
feel he had the authority to issue WERBELL any other type of number, he issued him an
Embassy number. When ACKERMAN was asked if he knew PAUL ARNOLD MARRIOTT, he
said the name was vaguely familiar but could not recall anything further. When
ACKERMAN was asked if he knew EARLENE DOBBS, he stated that he did not, to the best
of his knowledge. ACKERMAN stated that his knowledge of WERBELL came solely from
ADAMS and other stories he heard around the Embassy of the fire power demonstration
to be given for the King. ACKERMAN stated he had no personal knowledge of WERBELL.
