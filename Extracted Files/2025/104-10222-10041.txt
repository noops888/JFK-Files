MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel
SUBJECT
Compromise of Cover
:
1. As a result of information obtained from reliable
sources who served in Vietnam, we have established that
the former Staff personnel listed on the attachment should
be presumed to have been compromised as CIA employees to
the North Vietnam Intelligence Service as of April 1975.
We presume also that the identifications of these individ-
uals as CIA employees were passed by the North Vietnamese
to the Soviets.
2. Although the personnel listed in the attachment
are no longer employed by CIA, nevertheless, I suggest
that their official personnel records should be documented
concerning the possible past compromise of their cover.
3.
Please coordinate any action connected with this
memorandum with Chief, CCS; Chief, CMGB and Chief, CI
Staff.

Conein was in U.S. military from September 1941 through
September 1961, and on detail to OSS, SSU, CIG, and CIA to time
of military retirement.
He was picked up as a civilian and as a career agent on
12 November 1961 and retired on dizability on 15 July 1968.
Archenhold advised that subject claims military service as
indicated above and that the only period to be certified is the period
as a civilian, November '61 to July ¿z. This all we know about
what Concin told DEA.

Luke Conein has applied for employment
with the Drug Enforcement Agency. The
Acting D/Pers asked for the attached info
from CIA.
Sent to D/Pers for signature. Conein
was very controversial, much in the news
about the overthrow of Ngo Dinh Diem and
has been mentioned by Howard Hunt in Hunt's
recent hearing before "Watergate" committee.
Dick Biladeau, Central Cover, affirms that
Conein is "opened up".

28 September 1973
Stan Archenhold, x 7264, one of the Agency's drug coordinators
with DEA, called me yesterday afternoon. DEA had requested a memo
verifying employment of Mr. Lucien E. Conein, whose name has
appeared frequently during the Watergate hearings. The attached
memorandum is what Archenhold wants.
Conein's service was verified with ROB; his 'honorable service"
was cleared with SAS. Since he was under cover as contract, I dis-
cussed the case with Dick Biladeau of Central Cover. CCS had
opened up Conein last year and Biladean approved release of the
information to DEA. We had verified this service to a Justice Depart-
ment investigator approximately one year ago when Conein was being
considered as a consultant for BNDD.
Archenhold offered to carry the memorandum to DEA.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel
VIA
SUBJECT
: Deputy Director for Plans
NOT
: Lt. Col. Lucien E. Conein
1. A recommendation for the approval of the Director of
Personnel is contained in paragraph three (3).
2. Lt. Col. Lucien Conein served as a military detailee
to the Agency and predecessor organizations until his retirement
from the U. S. Army Reserves on 30 September 1961. He be-
came a Career Agent in November 1961 and served primarily in
Saigon as the senior advisor to the Chief of Station on major
counter insurgency programs until his retirement for disability
in July 1968. He is an expert on Vietnamese affairs and was
awarded the Intelligence Star for his performance during the
November 1963 coup in Saigon. Because of his extensive overseas
experience with the Military and the Agency, especially in Viet-
nam, he has access to many Vietnamese, French and other
target individuals in the Washington area. He is already acquainted
with many of these people and both he and his wife have access to
other potential target individuals in the foreign diplomatic com-
munity.
3. Approval is requested to employ Lt. Col. Conein for
use against the Vietnamese, French and other targets as a re-
employed annuitant under a Memorandum of Oral Committment.
He will be paid $50.00 for each specific task assigned to him,
such as developing contacts or assessing individuals of opera-
tional interest to the Base, as stipulated by the Base in advance.
His total compensation will not exceed $2,400.00 per annuin.
This annual payment, coupled with his annuity of approximately
$4, 700 per annum will not exceed ninety per cent of his salary
as a GS-14/4 at the time of his retirement. A Non-Staff Person-
