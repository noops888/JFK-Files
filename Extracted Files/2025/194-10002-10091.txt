One of the speakers at this meeting told of his trip to New
Delhi and the Soviet Union. He said the Soviet Union, Cuba,
and China have been accused of suppressing rights, freedom,
religion and speech. He said that this was not true. These
comtries do not want soap box criticians but they respect the
broader right of the majority and sometimes individual rights
have to give way to the rights of the majority.
The guest spealær at this meeting was DMITRY NURAYEV,
who was introduced as a Cultural Attache with the Soviet
Embassy. He presented the Secretary of the ARI with a gold
watch and read ead a prepared speech. He said Russia wants peace
and that the U.S. and Russia fought together during the war
and still can be friends but Hazi elements in Germany are
being supported by the U.S. Government. He said Russia would
disarm if disarmament could be agreed upon but now the U.S.
has rearmed Germany and they have the second largest army in
Burope with rockets, tanios, and atomic weapons. He said the
Russians are ready to defend their homeland against the Germans
and felt that they had to do something to dramatise their
readiness to defend themselves so they resumed atomic testing.

A skit was then presented to represent the petition
of the Communist Party before the Supreme Court in regard to
the registration provisions of the McCarran Act. After the
akit, MICKEY LIMA was introduced as Chairman of the Northern
California District of the CP, who would present his views on
the registration. LIMA read a statement in which he said that
the CP in good conscience could not and would not register
because to do so would violate the law of self-incrimination.
If the CP registered, they would admit to being spies,
saboteurs, and agents of a foreign power.
LIMA said that the CP is leading the fight for
freedon. If the present trend continues, the Government can
later attack the labor unions and the National National Association
Tor the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The ruling
party in the Government will be able to get any group they
wish to register.
SF T-2-12/10/61
Subject attended a meeting sponsored by the CCCL
held at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, on January 24,
1962. The Chairman of the meeting pave an opening statement
of the purpose of the CCCL and the purpose of the meeting.
He mentioned that the Bill of Rights is under attack and that
the military forces are controlling the Government and the
press and that civil rights are being repressed. He said that
these things are of concern to the Committee and they have
asked GUS HALL to present his views of the current situation.
HALL then spoke and said that he is presently on a
lecture tour all over the country presenting the views of the
CP. He mentioned that he had requests to speak at schools all
over the United States. He said that the CP is being prevented
by law and by control of the press from expressing their views
and that they only want the right of free speech which is being
denied them.
HALL said that at a recent press conference he was
asked to give his position in the Party both now and prior to
June 6, 1961. He told the press at that time that he could be
referred to as an authoritative spokesman for communism.
HALL said that the people don't really know what
the McCarran law means. When the law went into effect he was
NW 88613 Docld:34528578 Page 7
279
SF 100-33836
TD/rew
supposed to register. He has been indicted already and is
under possible se sentence of 500 years in jail and and $1,000,000
fine. HALL went on to say that he went to jail under the
Smith Act and that for thirty years the Government has tried
to prove that the CP has been advocating the violent
overthrow of the Government and that all commists are agents
of a foreign power and are espionage agents etc. but has falled
to do so.
According to HALL, the McCarran Act came into
being during the McCarthy era when the Administration was
being pressured to prosecute communists. The Attorney General
said the Government couldn't prosecute them as they did not
have the necessary evidence. Congress decided to get around
the courts by legislative enactment. They appointed a political
committee and presented a lot of illegal and unconstitutional
evidence and came up with a finding that the communite are
agents of a foreign power and spies and saboteurs.
HALL said that, according to the Attorney General,
the present Act is simply a registration statute similar to
registrations of foreigners, voters, dealers in securities, etc.
However, a recent decision of the Supreme Court held that it
is not necessary to be a card carrying member of the CF or do
an act which is generally attributed to communists but it is
only necessary to have a state of mind and be in sympathy
with any of the objectives of commmmism and you could be
prosecuted under the law.
HALL said assuming he did register, he would have
to register each official and member of the Party and if he
didn't, they would be required to register or be liable to
$10,000 fine and ten years imprisonment for each day they
failed to register. He would also be required to register any
commist organization or any association or organization that
has affiliation with the CP. He must also list every typewriter,
mimeograph machine, photostat machine, and printing press by
serial zamber. HALL said that you can begin to see the
diabolical threat of fascian which is beginning to become real.
He said that in addition to these penalties, he can receive
the death penalty in Texas, a life sentence in other states
and sentences of 20 to 50 years in other states. He is also
prohibited from obtaining Veterans or Goverment housing,
employment in the teaching profession, from making movies in
NW 88613 Docld:34528578 Page 8
280
Hollywood, or plays on Broadway under this Act. He said
that communists can't even work in Government atomic plants.
HALL said that California has more native right-wing
support than any other state and it is the idea of certain
right-wingers to unite these organizations under one group.
He said that is how Naziem came about and they won't stop with
the CP. HALL said that the reason the right-wing is making
such an onslaught is because a different social system
is overtaking capitalism and many of the older people find
it difficult to accept the new philosophy of life and they oppрове
it.

of the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950 and the

McCarran and Smith Acts. In addition, it has been set up to
reverse the Supreme Court's decision of June 5, 1961, or secure
an indefinite stay of any enforcement of the law by the Department
of Justice.

ment to mobilize legal assistance of any organization or
individual whose "democratic rights are infringed upon by
these laws." This committee wants to encourage the creation of
local organizations or groups to work in support of any one of
the above-stated objectives. The committee will also serve as

A. San Francisco County CP (SFCCP)
SF T-2, a self-admitted former member of the CP in
the San Francisco area during the period from 1952 to 1957,
advised on November 5, 1962, that she knows IRVING FROMER
and his wife as members of the CP in San Francisco during
that period.
At a meeting of the Sunset Club, SFCCP, which was
held at 1235 42nd Avenue, San Francisco, on May 15, 1962, a
discussion was held regarding IRVING PROMER and his wife.
It was noted that the PROMERS had recently moved to the area
covered by the Sunset Club. HERB NUGENT, Chairman of the
SFCCP and a member of the Sunset Club, remarked that the
FROMERS are in the Lincoln Club, SPCCP, and that they are needed
in the Lincoln Club. He said, however, that the PROMERS do
not contribute much to Club life and this is one of the
problems of the Lincoln Club. He said that the Lincoln Club
had agreed to neet at the FROMERS house, and the PROMERS
didn't even arrive to attend meetings held at their own home.
NUGENT said that both of the FROMERS are active in other
mass organizations.

The Subject attended a May Day meeting held at 150
Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, on May 1, 1962, sponsored
by the San Francisco Free Speech Forum. The Free Speech Forum
was set up by the SFCCP to hold public meetings.
WALTER STACK, a member of the SFCCP, was chairman
of this meeting and spoke on the meeting of May Day as a labor
holiday.
ARCHIE BROWN, a member of the SFCCP, discussed his
conviction under the Landum-Griffith Act. He said it is a test
case to see if the act is constitutional. They noted that he
was elected to the Executive Board of Local 10, International
Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (LIWU), by members of
the local and it would make no difference if he resigned from
the CP because the Landum-Griffith Act says a person must not
have been a member in the past five years.
RALPH IZARD, a member of the SFCCP, gave a speech
on the subject of government and monopolies
He said the
government should spend money on the unemployed, the sick,
and the ill-housed instead of spending money trying to dominate
former colonial countries trying to establish independence.
ELIZABETH GURLEY FLYNN, Chairman, CP of the United
States of America (CPUSA), was the featured speaker. She
said that things were different today for Communists under
indictment than when she was indicted under the Smith Act.
She said at that time all doors were shut to them, but now
all doors are open. She said that GUS HALL and BEN DAVIS,
Communist functionaries, have been speaking to students all

The Subject attended a public meeting sponsored by
the CP held at 150 Golden Gate Avenue on December 5, 1952.
MICKEY LIMA, Chairman of the Northern District of California
CP, was Master of Ceremonies at this meeting. He said that
he need not be introduced as everyone knew what his political
views were. He introduced JOHN APT, Legal Council for the CP
and Defense Attorney for CP members victimized by the McCarran
Committee.
JOHN APT spoke of the complexities of the McCarran
Act and how it had been used before in an attempt to convict
MICKEY LIMA and others, and he told how the government had
reversed the conviction on LIMA and the others because they
lacked evidence to prove their charges. Now, the government
is trying to get these people to confess to something that they
had failed to prove the first time.
APT stated that President TRUMAN vetoed the McCarran
Act on the grounds that it would put the government in the roll
of a dictator.
He also spoke of the concentration camps scattered
throughout the country and noted that anyone could be placed
in them if the government felt they were a danger to the
national war crisis.
He spoke of the flexibility of the McCarran Act,
which he said could be used against any citizen for any given
reason and at any given time.
