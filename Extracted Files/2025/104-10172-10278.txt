ACTION: FYI
1. Subject was interviewed for an immigrant visa on 7 July 65.
Unfortunately Clastonbury could not be present because of other business.
The interviewing officer was briefed prior to the meeting and faced the
applicant with a series of questions regarding her association with
Soviets and any approaches that may have been made to her in light of her
unusual life. In response to these questions, we are told that SLIOOR
gave thoughtful consideration to each question and probably truthfully
replied that although she has met several Soviet diplomats, no approaches
for cooperation were made to her. She realized the full implication of
the questions and made no attempts to be evasive. Subject was given
her visa immediately after the interview.
2. Attachment 1 is a translation of the VALIK traces on subject.
As noted in the traces SLIOOR was an acquaintance of Griferiv GOB
(201-150156) and Georgiy STERING: born 29 June 1913 in Moscow (aka
Georgi STEINING OPHA-1807, 30 July 56 and OPHW1456, 9 October 56).
These names were not used in the interview.
3. Attachment 2 is a thermofax copy of SLIOOR's visa; Attachment 3;
birth record; Attachment 4, marriage certificate.
4. From subject's visa application her address in the U.S. is listed
as Fort Hood, Texas.
