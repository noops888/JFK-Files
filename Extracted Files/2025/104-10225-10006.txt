MEMORANDUM FOR:
FROM
:
SUBJECT
:
Chairman, GS-12 Evaluation Board
Raymond A. Warren
Chief, Latin America Division
Recommendation for Promotion to
Grade GS-13, Daniel Flores
1. Mr. Daniel Flores was recently assigned to OTR as an
operations instructor to capitalize on his fine operational
record which he developed during his two field assignments in
Guayaquil, Ecuador, and in Lima, Peru, and his most recent
operational assignment with LA/COG. His overall performance
has clearly been characterized by exceptional proficiency and
he has been rated by his most recent supervisor as "outstanding"
for his handling of a sensitive on-island case and his development:
and pursuit of Cuban operational leads. Mr. Flores has definite
growth potential and clearly meets or exceeds the criteria for
promotica to Grade GS-13, a promotion which is most strongly
recommended.
2.
During the past year Mr. Flores was responsible for
handling a very sensitive, and well placed on-island Cuban asset.
This asset is probably one of the "messiest and disorganized
individuals" with whom a case officer in this Agency has had
to contend. However, Mr. Flores clearly demonstrated his fine
handling abilities in his manipulation and exploitation of this
agent. As a result of his guidance and his ability to effectively
debrief this person, Mr. Flores was able to make this asset
one of our most productive on-island sources. During the last
year this source produced 51 reports on subject matter which
often commanded attention at the highest levels of our government.
3. Mr. Flores has shown a remarkable growth potential
during the last year. He is determined, persistent, serious,
and commendably aggressive. He is mature, self-assured, and
his operational decisions are sound. His managerial skills are
in keeping with his operational potential. He was often called
SECRET
EYLS ONLY
EX IMPDET
CI. BY 025231
14-00000
SECRET
EYES ONLY
upon in the last twelve months to act as Chief of his section,
a GS-14 position. He demonstrated sound leadership qualities
by stimulating interest and enthusiasm in his staff. His
operational programs were aggressive and imaginative.
Mr. Flores' supervisory talents combined with his excellent
professional skills portend a continuing and successful career
in this Agency.
4.
:
While assigned to LA/COG, Mr. Flores was involved
in the spotting, assessing, developing access to, and eventually
pitching a Cuban who was the head of Cubana Airlines in a
Latin American country. The recruitment pitch was not successful
but the details of this operation were handled in the most
professional manner. Mr. Flores developed more leads to relatives
and friends of Cuban officials during this period than any other
LA/COG operations officer. He has native fluency in Spanish and
feels "at home" operating in the field. While in LA/COG
Mr. Flores was called upon to do a considerable amount of TDY
travel since he was on call to meet his on-island asset anytime,
any place whenever the agent traveled out of Cuba. In addition
to these travels, Mr. Flores did a lot of traveling seeking
out and debriefing potential access agents. During this last
year he clearly demonstrated his ability to function independently
and to assume responsibilities usually reserved for officers
much more senior in grade and experience.
5. Mr. Flores was assigned in July 1976 to OTR on a
two-year rotational assignment as an operations instructor.
Upon complection of this assignment, Mr. Flores will return to
this Division to assume responsibilities, either at Headquarters
or in the field, commensurate with his demonstrated operational
and managerial talents. In recognition of Mr. Flores' outstanding
agent handling skills, his overall professional competency, and
his obvious growth potential, it is strongly recommended that
Mr. Flores be promoted to Grade GS-13.

SUBJECT
: Completion of Training Report
Trainee: Daniel Flores
Training Program: MURAD
1. For your information and for documentation in Daniel Flores'
official personnel file, this memorandum certifies that he received
the five-day SAI Persuasion Skills course at an NOCB safesite in Ar-
lington, Virginia, between 11 and 17 August 1976. The instructor was
Mr. George Steitz.
2. Briefly, the SAI course is a program in human relations and
communications effectiveness on the interpersonal level. It provides
the traince with a framework for analyzing problems usually encounter-
ed in supervisory or in agent development, recruitment, and handling
situations and with a system for presenting his ideas in a way stand-
ing the best chance for success in gaining a target individual's will-
ing acceptance. Flores was an active and most interested participant
throughout the program and achieved a good understanding of the basic
principles involved. A copy of his course critique is attached for
your information.
3. Since Flores is an ALT Instructor, we plan to dispense with
the formality of a post-training questionnaire.

Instructor: Mr. Steita
August 1976-
TOSSA us in making decisions about future SAI training or application,
your answers to the following questions will be most appreciated,
1. Do you feel SAI training was helpful to you? (If you choose to do so, please
explain why or how.) This course was extremely useful to re. One of the main
features of the course -- how to perciêve the other percons objectives before
your own was of particular interest because, as an instructor it will be one
of the rain tools I will use in evaluating the level of understanding of each
trainee. This experience will also be very helpful to me in my career as
a case officer. I can think of several instance where SAI could have helped me
turn several failures (recruitment pitches) into succeezes.
2. Did SAI training provide you with any concepts or tools which can be applied
in a practical way to your work problems? To your personal life? Any
examples you care to mention?
The benefits that this course will provide for
me in my job as an instructor are clear. I am absolutely certain that putting
the SAI concept into practice will bring forth not only self satisfication but
career benefits as well. This will also be very helpful to me in my personal
life. I can see now that sore of the concepts will be put to work inmediately.
3. What elements, segments, or aspects of the SAI training were of the most interest
or use to you?
The greatest revelation from an operation point of view, was the
clarifcation of perhaps an erroneous idea we have about obtaining our intelligence
objectives. I always cperated under the belief that the most important thing in
my work was to attain my objectives, 1.e, the recruitment of an agent. SAI
revealed that this is true but it also revealed that it is more important to
first considered the target's (agent.de) objectives. Once we do this our chances
(in my opinion after taking SAI) success would probably increase by at least
90 per cent. If I were to stress one point it would be that more emphasis be
placed on dealing with the target's rather than the Co's objectives.
4. Would you recomend SAI training for other of our personnel?
I am sure that bany people would be recorrendod for this training and that all
would benefit. it. However, I would strongly recomand that personnel
officere be gin SAI a. e prerequisite to their he.
thes in dealing with large mumbers of different wople.
would certainly help
5. What other components or categories of personnel do you believe would benefit
from SAI training to a degree making it worthwhile for them to receive it?
6. Please comment, if you have any definite opinion, on the duration and pace of
the training: too long/short? too fast/slow? The pace of the course was
exellent. However, adding one or two more days would certainly help in putting
the SAI concepts into practice by the trainee himself. That is, perhaps a live
excercise with a person who is not aware of the training situation. A traince
could be tasked to elicit information from an unwitting participant. The use
of videotapes and/or movies would help in testing the trainees perceptiveness
through the course.
7. Any other comments you may wish to make:
A brief corrent about the instructor. He was definitely responsible for the
success of the course. Mr. Steitz showed excellent knowledge of the SAI raterial
and throughout the course kept the student's interest alive x by showing tremendous
enthusiasm in what he was teaching. The end result of the professionalism that
Fr. Steita demonstrated in the class is reflected in the comments stated here and
in the confidance he instilled in re personally.
8. On a scale of 1 to 5, how would you rate SAI training in relation to
other training you have received from the Agency? Please encircle ap-
