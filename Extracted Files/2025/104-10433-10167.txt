On November 21, 1973, Mr. Raymond Rocca of the
Central Intelligence Agency personally delivered the attached
press release noting that the captioned committee was sponsoring
a two-day conference at Georgetown University on November 23 and
24 in commemoration of the Tenth Anniversary of President John F.

Special Agent William Turner was scheduled to be the moderator
of a panel dealing with unique investigative techniques. In the
program Turner is identified as a former FBI Agent, author of
numerous books on investigative techniques. Among others
appearing on the program are Fred Cook, Mark/Lane, Harold Weisberg,
all of whom who have been outspoken critics of the FBI.
The Central Intelligence Agency, according to Mr. Rocca,
was concerned over the appearance of their ex-employees
Victor Marchetti and George O'Toole.
Mr. Rocca advised that his Agency would have coverage
of the conference and that he would be happy to pass along any
data developed by their coverage.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
In observance of the tenth anniversary of President Kennedy's death,
the Committee to Investigate Assassinations is sponsoring a two-day
Conference at Georgetown University on November 23rd and 24th. A
brochure describing the Conference and its program is attached. As
you will note, several of the Nation's prominent writers and investi-
gators of the assassinations of the past decade will speak.
i
While a number of different points of view on the subject will be
represented, there is general consensus that the Executive Branch has
failed to make known all the relevant facts of the assassinations..
We believe that the Congress must ultimately take the initiative if
the public is to learn all of the facts, and that Watergate has shown
us that Congress' action depends largely on disclosures by an informed
press and other news media.
A press pass will be available for you at the Conference registration
desk. For further information, please contact:
