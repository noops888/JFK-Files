INTRODUCTION
The following summary and analysis is not intended to be
all inclusive, that is to contain a specific comment on all organi-
zational, operational, personality and case type information furnished
by Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO. To attempt to do so would be repetitious
and confusing to the reader and would not be of material benefit in the
formation of logical conclusions concerning the rather limited areas of
primary concern.
This summary will not contain a detailed psychological
assessment of NOSENKO nor will it contain a recitation of the numerous
theories which have been promulgated in the past concerning varying
aspects of the NOSENKO case. This summary will be primarily
directed toward the question of whether NOSENKO was or was not
dispatched by the KGB, whether his claimed KGB career is relatively
plausible and whether he has since late October 1967 been cooperative in
a reassessment of the entire case for or against NOSENKO. NOSENKO
has admitted certain lies and exaggerations in the past but claims that
these were of a personal nature, intended to enhance his own importance
SECRET
USJEP 1
from cautematic
ia and

SECRET
but not to mislead this Agency in any material matters of an operational
or policy nature.
In order to avoid any misunderstanding of the phrase "bona
fides" as considered in this summary, NOSENKO will be judged primarily
on whether he voluntarily defected to this Agency without KGB knowledge,
and whether his 1962 and early 1964 contacts with representatives of this
Agency were known to the KGB. Motivation and certain other pertinent
aspects will be considered, but his admitted previous errors, lies and
exaggerations will not per se warrant a conclusion that NOSENKO is not a
"bona fide" defector.
There is not an accurate standard or scale of measurement
against which information concerning NOSENKO can be balanced or
correlated to determine if he is or is not a dispatched KGB officer. For
purposes of this analysis and summary, an arbitrary list of areas
considered pertinent has been compiled. Readers may differ in regard to
whether this arbitrary standard is a completely accurate standard, but it
is felt that the information from NOSENKO and information from other
sources derived through independent investigation will permit the reader
to assess the information in toto against any standard he considers
appropriate.
The previous summary on NOSENKO entitled, "The Exami-
nation of the Bona Fides of a KGB Defector, "has been considered in

the preparation of this summary. It will be commented on in part
and this summary will include conclusions correlated with the seven
primary conclusions set forth on page 358 of the above summary.
Remarks concerning certain errors, inconsistencies, omissions and
unsupported conclusions in the previous summary in regard to specific
cases or sub-areas will be included in this summary. However, this
summary will not include a point-by-point comparison of all areas of
agreement or disagreement with information contained in the previous
summary.
A positive decision in regard to NOSENKO based on all
available information should be made in the immediate future. There
are no known sources currently available to provide new positive
information concerning NOSENKO and his bona fides. It is recognized
that there is always a possibility in the future a new source or sources
will be able to furnish additional information in regard to NOSENKO.
However, this possibility is exceedingly tenuous and it is felt there
is sufficient information available on which to base a conclusion in
the NOSENKO matter.

SUMMARY OF DEVELOPMENTS IN NOSENKO CASE
SINCE 30 OCTOBER 1967
Since 30 October 1967, interviews with Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO
have been conducted by one individual not previously known personally to
NOSENKO but who has been aware of the NOSENKO case since June 1962.
Interviews have been detailed and very extensive in scope, have
been recorded and transcribed, and have covered the entire life and career
of NOSENKO without regard to whether a particular aspect had been
covered during previous interview or interviews.
NOSENKO, although naturally apprehensive during the first few
interviews, has been cooperative, has developed a relaxed attitude, and
the interviewer has noted no significant reluctance to discuss any aspect
of his life, career, or activities. On occasion NOSENKO has indicated a
reluctance to make positive statements in certain areas previously
considered at a minimum extremely controversial. This reluctance
was understandable and when it became apparent to NOSENKO that the
SECRET
LAP 1

downgrading and
declassification
0001011
14-00000
SECRET
interviewer would not dispute or disparage his statements without adequate
reason, this reluctance on the part of NOSENKO, in the opinion of the
interviewer, totally disappeared.
During the interviewing period, particularly in the first six months,
NOSENKO materially assisted the interviewer by preparing approximately
sixty memoranda on such diverse subjects as his life, motivation for de-
fection, individual cases, notes which he furnished to CIA in 1964, KGB
organization, and KGB officer and agent personalities. As an example
of the scope of this work by NOSENKO, four of the memoranda included
remarks concerning approximately (875) KGB officers, 100 KGB agents,
35 GRU officers, and 400 other Soviet nationals. These lists were alpha-
betically arranged and the above indicated cooperation of NOSENKO has
materially assisted in the organization and evaluation of information
furnished by him during current interviews.
Copies of transcripts of interviews with NOSENKO and related
memoranda have been disseminated to the FBI and the CI Staff. Special
Agent Elbert Turner and Special Agent James Wooten of the Washington
Field Office/FBI in particular have given great assistance in research
and compilation of new or additional information and the FBI has inter-
viewed or reinterviewed a number of United States citizens concerning
whom NOSENKO has furnished pertinent information.

In addition, three professionals from the SB Division have
reviewed the current information and assisted in the retrieval of
previous information from NOSENKO and collation of current
information with previous information. The latter is a tremendous
task because of the volume of material; the number of individual
cases involved; and the extensive information in regard to KGB
personalities, procedures, organizational structure and activities.
The SB Division also provided the services of an expert
translator to translate the tapes of the 1965 interrogation of NOSENKO
by Petr DERYABIN and one of the previously mentioned three pro-
fessionals completed a new translation of the 1962 interviews with
NOSENKO. In addition, transcriptions of certain other particularly
pertinent previous interviews of NOSENKO have been completed by
the Office of Security.
Approximately 7000 pages of transcripts and related material
have been compiled and disseminated since late October 1967. Com-
ments concerning the value of the information contained in the above
material are contained in another section of this summary. As of the
present time, a complete analysis is not possible since a considerable
portion of the material has not been fully processed. In the preparation
of this summary all areas of major significance have been examined.
Because of the voluminous information, all analytical and collation work
has not been completed; but it is not considered that, based on all
3
SECPET
6001013
14-00000
SECRET
available information, the remaining work will materially affect
the conclusions drawn in this summary.
The polygraph interview of NOSENKO was initiated on
2 August and concluded on 6 August 1968. Approximately sixty
questions of a pertinent nature were included in the polygraph inter-
view. No problems were encountered during the polygraph interview
and no additional testing of NOSENKO is anticipated. Attached is a
copy of the self-explanatory report on the results of the polygraph
interview.
Interviews with NOSENKO have continued since the polygraph
interview on a temporarily reduced scale in order to permit a review
of previous information and preparation of this summary. There is
no doubt that future interviews with NOSENKO will reveal information
of intelligence value, but information developed thus far will permit
a decision in the case of Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO.

ANALYTICAL COMMENTS CONCERNING THE BONA FIDES OF
YURIY IVANOVICH NOSENKO
As indicated in the introduction to this summary, information in
regard to Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO will be considered against an arbi-
trary but realistic list of areas considered pertinent to the question of
whether NOSENKO voluntarily defected to this Agency without KGB
knowledge, and whether his 1962 and early 1964 contacts with represent-
atives of this Agency were known to the KGB.
It was noted that motivation and certain other pertinent aspects
would also be considered but that his admitted previous lies and exag-
gerations would not per se warrant a conclusion that NOSENKO is not a
"bona fide defector."
The following is a list of the areas considered pertinent and which
are being given specific consideration. Attached is a separate section
containing remarks in regard to the designated areas of A - H.
A. Is NOSENKO identical to the person whom he claims
to be?
B. Is the claimed KGB career of NOSENKO plausible?

D. Is the information furnished by NOSENKO to CIA
concerning KGB operations, personalities, and organi-
zation reasonably commensurate with his claimed KGB
career?
E. Can the information furnished by NOSENKO be con-
sidered in toto as having resulted in material damage
to the KGB and/or has the information furnished by
NOSENKO been of significant benefit to Western Intelli-
gence?
F. Is there evidence of KGB deception or "give away" in
information furnished by NOSENKO which would warrant
a conclusion that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB?
G. Is there evidence of a political or any other type objective
which could justify a dispatch of NOSENKO by the KGB
with permission to speak freely to CIA concerning his
knowledge of the KGB and without NOSENKO being given

A. Is NOSENKO identical to the person whom he claims to be?
During interviews NOSENKO has furnished detailed information in regard
to his family, his activities as a youth, the schools he attended, assoc-
iates of his father and mother, and his own associates. The period
under consideration in this section is the period preceding his entry
into the First Department, Second Chief Directorate, MVD, in mid-
March 1953.
Information furnished by NOSENKO concerning his father and
mother and his early life, together with other information such as a
comparison of photographs of NOSENKO and a photograph of his father
and confirmed travel of his mother to Western Europe in 1956 with
Madame KOSYGINA, conclusively establish that he is Yuriy Ivanovich
NOSENKO, the son of Ivan Isidorovich NOSENKO, the Minister of Ship-
building in the USSR prior to his death in 1956. This is also satisfactorily
supported by personal-type information furnished by NOSENKO concern-
ing other associates of his father and mother.
Since, as indicated above, there is considered to be no doubt
that Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO is the son of the former Minister of
Shipbuilding, a detailed study of his life prior to 1945 (age 18) is of
SECRET
GROUP 1
Excluded from automatic
downgrading and

0001026

SECRET
little or no value in assessing the bona fides or non-bona fides of
NOSENKO. An expose of his youthful indiscretions, of which he has
admitted a number, is of no import in a discussion of whether NOSENKO
was or was not dispatched by the KGB. Obtaining any collateral first-
hand information in regard to NOSENKO before 1945 would be of
negligible value, but there actually is supporting information from
Nikolay ARTAMONOV, a defector from the Soviet Navy, concerning
the claimed attendance by NOSENKO at a military-naval preparatory
school in Leningrad.
NOSENKO, during current interviews, has stated that he grad-
uated from the Institute of International Relations in 1950 and had
attended the Institute since 1945. He has explained that he should have
graduated in 1949 since it was a four-year course, but failed the final
examination in Marxism and therefore was required to attend the Institute
for a longer period of time and again take his final examinations.
Based on information furnished by NOSENKO concerning co-
students and the Institute, there is no reason to doubt that he actually
attended and graduated from the Institute of International Relations in
1950. The previous controversy in this matter was complicated by
NOSENKO who, in 1964 after his defection, stated in a biography that
he had graduated from the Institute in 1949. Actually this statement
2
SECRET
0001027
14-00000
SECRET
by NOSENKO in 1964 resulted in conflicting information since NOSENKO
on 9 June 1962 during his first contact with CIA had stated that he
"completed the Institute of International Relations in 1950. "NOSENKO
has given the explanation that he changed the date of his graduation to
1949 because he did not wish to admit that he had failed to graduate in
1949. NOSENKO explained that this change in his date of graduation
caused him to pre-date his actual entry into Navy Intelligence to 1950
instead of 1951 and his actual entry into the KGB from 1953 to 1952.
The above action by NOSENKO is included in what NOSENKO has
characterized as his "stupid blunders." The latter is a rather apt
characterization of his now admitted lies and exaggerations but is not
evidence that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB. It is evidence of
a certain personality trait of NOSENKO who has in the past by his own
admission tended to enhance his importance and astuteness by graphically
portraying his personal participation in KGB activities concerning which
he had knowledge but did not personally participate.
The claimed service of NOSENKO in Navy Intelligence during
March 1951 to early 1953 in the Far East and the Baltic areas has been
seriously questioned in the past. Specific comments on this period of
3
0001028
SECRET
14-00000
SECRET
time are contained in a separate section of this summary, but it is
considered that the recent interviews of NOSENKO satisfactorily sub-
stantiate his claimed service in Navy Intelligence during March 1951
to early 1953.
Attached is a typed copy of a handwritten memorandum completed
by NOSENKO on 31 October 1967. This is a biographical statement con-
cerning his life and KGB career. No effort has been made to correct
grammatical errors or spelling since to do so would be in conflict with
the manner in which current interviews were conducted; namely, to give
NOSENKO an opportunity to recount his life and activities to permit a re-
examination of the entire case. The comprehension and fluency of
NOSENKO in the English language was adequate for interview purposes
in October 1967 and both have materially improved since that time.
Interviews of and memoranda prepared by NOSENKO since
31 October 1967 have not indicated any material discrepancies with the
statements of NOSENKO in the attached memorandum. One change that
has been made by NOSENKO is that he now dates his transfer from the
First Department, Second Chief Directorate (SCD), KGB, to the Seventh
Department, SCD, as occurring in the latter part of May 1955 rather
than June - July 1955 as indicated in the attached statement. NOSENKO
also now dates the period in which an unsatisfactory "characterization"
4

(personnel evaluation) was prepared on NOSENKO in March - April
1955 rather than May - June 1955. Since the unsatisfactory personnel
report was directly related to his transfer to the Seventh Department,
neither of the above changes are considered to be of a significant nature.
An effort has been made during current interviews to differentiate between
errors due to faulty memory and discrepancies indicative of deception by
NOSENKO.
