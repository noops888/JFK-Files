# Fast Path Extraction Pipeline for JFK Files

## Overview

This document outlines a streamlined approach to quickly extract text from the JFK Files collection that already contains embedded OCR text. This fast path approach will allow you to build a searchable knowledge base with minimal processing time and technical complexity.

## Fast Path Extraction Pipeline

### Stage 1: Text Extraction from OCR-Ready PDFs

**Goal**: Quickly extract embedded text from PDFs that already have OCR applied

**Tools Needed**:
- Python with PyPDF2 or pdfplumber library
- Basic file management utilities

**Process**:
1. Scan the collection to identify PDFs with embedded text
2. Extract text directly without OCR processing
3. Save extracted text to structured files
4. Track any files with extraction issues for later processing

### Stage 2: Basic Text Cleaning

**Goal**: Clean up common OCR artifacts and formatting issues

**Tools Needed**:
- Python with basic text processing libraries
- Regular expressions for pattern matching

**Process**:
1. Remove common OCR artifacts (e.g., broken words, strange characters)
2. Fix spacing and line break issues
3. Normalize text formatting
4. Preserve document metadata (filename, path, etc.)

### Stage 3: Chunking & Embedding

**Goal**: Prepare text for RAG by chunking and embedding

**Tools Needed**:
- LangChain for document processing
- Sentence-Transformers for embeddings
- ChromaDB for vector storage

**Process**:
1. Split documents into appropriate chunks (500-1000 tokens)
2. Generate embeddings for each chunk
3. Store chunks and embeddings in vector database
4. Index metadata for improved retrieval

### Stage 4: Simple Query Interface

**Goal**: Create a basic interface to query the knowledge base

**Tools Needed**:
- LangChain for retrieval
- Local LLM (e.g., Ollama with Llama2)
- Basic Python for interface

**Process**:
1. Set up retrieval mechanism using similarity search
2. Connect to an LLM for query processing
3. Create a simple command-line interface
4. Enable basic filtering by metadata

## Implementation Timeline

| Stage | Estimated Time | Technical Complexity |
|-------|----------------|----------------------|
| Text Extraction | 1-2 days | Low |
| Basic Text Cleaning | 1-2 days | Low |
| Chunking & Embedding | 2-3 days | Medium |
| Query Interface | 1 day | Low |
| **Total** | **5-8 days** | **Low to Medium** |

## Key Advantages

1. **Speed**: Bypasses the time-consuming OCR process
2. **Simplicity**: Requires minimal technical knowledge
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Uses significantly less computational resources
4. **Early Results**: Provides a working knowledge base in days rather than weeks
5. **Incremental Improvement**: Creates a foundation that can be enhanced later

## Next Steps

After implementing this fast path extraction pipeline, you can:

1. Evaluate the quality of extracted text
2. Identify problematic documents for secondary processing
3. Refine the chunking and embedding strategy based on query results
4. Gradually enhance the system with more advanced features

The next document will outline a more thorough secondary processing pipeline for handling problematic documents and enhancing the quality of the knowledge base.
